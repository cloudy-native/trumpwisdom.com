Any Asians? Asian? Asian? Any Asian? Asian-American unemployment recently achieved the lowest rate ever recorded in our history. You've heard me say this.

The U.S. jobless rate for Asians has been around for less than 20 years. The jobless rate for women was 3.6 percent in May and September, its lowest level in 65 years. Trump's comment implies that the jobless rates for Hispanics and Asians are older than 65 years, but they're not.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"17494, 14433, 14408, 13490, 13665, 13096, 12730, 12300, 11374, 10981, 10040, 9437, 9223, 8955, 5528, 5690, 4795, 4838, 4686, 4705, 4564, 4572","repeated_count":"22","date":"09/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
