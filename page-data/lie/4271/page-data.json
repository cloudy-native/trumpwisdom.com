Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U.S., always to our detriment. I say, as they come,Tax them. If they don’t want to be taxed, let them make or build the product in the U.S. In either event, it means jobs and great wealth.”","analysis":"There are winners and losers with tariffs, and some companies have begun to lay off workers while farmers face the prospect of big losses on crops. Trump has imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from foreign countries, but the foreign countries do not pay those tariffs. Rather, the U.S. importers bringing the products into the United States pay the tariffs. This makes the products more expensive and less attractive for U.S. consumers. This could drive U.S. importers to stop bringing in certain goods because they are too costly, hurting the foreign manufacturers, but those foreign companies do not pay the tariffs, and neither do the foreign countries where those companies are based.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
