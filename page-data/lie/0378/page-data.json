You can't do it faster, because they're obstructing. They're obstructionists.”","analysis":"Trump suggests that he isn’t filling administration posts because of Democratic obstruction. Democrats have slow-walked many of his cabinet nominees, but Trump has been much slower than his predecessors in filling sub-cabinet posts and other positions. Out of 553 key positions requiring Senate confirmation, 478 still have no nominee, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Another 29 have been announced but not formally nominated; only 22 positions have been confirmed. Republican senators have said they are growing impatient with the White House’s slow pace. So Trump really should be pointing the finger at his own staff.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/12/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
