NATO estimates that European NATO and Canada will add $130 billion in cumulative defense spending through 2020, in 2015 dollars, as an increase over 2016 spending. NATO also estimates the cumulative figure will rise to $400 billion through 2024. That's a big difference than $130 billion a year or $400 billion a year.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"27785, 26954, 26129, 25666, 25724, 25378, 24639, 23789","repeated_count":"8","date":"10/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
