We have 15 people in this massive country and because of the fact that we went early, we went early, we could have had a lot more than that.”","analysis":"In late February, Trump played down the number of coronavirus cases in the United States, frequently saying there were only 15 and they would soon be better. He often claimed the low figure was the result of travel restrictions he placed on non-U.S. citizens traveling from China. At the time the virus was spreading rapidly through the United States, largely undetected because the Trump administration failed to quickly set up effective testing. In early March, the case load started to explode. By March 4, there were more than 100 confirmed U.S. cases and six people had died. One week later, there were 800 cases and 27 deaths. By March 30, there were more than 165,000 cases and 3,000 deaths.
