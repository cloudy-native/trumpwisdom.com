Gregory Stenstrom, who identified himself as a poll watcher in Delaware County, claimed that, on Election Day, he saw thumb drives, called vCards, “being uploaded to the voting machines by the voting machine warehouse supervisor on multiple occasions.” Those uploads resulted in 50,000 votes for Biden, he said. \"Stenstrom did not provide any evidence that the cards were used to upload fraudulent votes or that Biden benefited from this purportedly illegal upload,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/nine-election-fraud-claims-none-credible/\">said FactCheck.org</a>. \"Delaware County officials explained to us that the vCards are used to transfer data from the paper-ballot scanning machines at each precinct to the central vote tabulating system. Uploading data from the vCards is part of the regular process for tallying votes — there’s nothing untoward about it. Other parts of his claim are also false, they said. 'The allegation that someone from the voting machine warehouse uploaded anything from any vCards is utterly false,' Adrienne Marofsky, the county’s spokeswoman, told us by email. Nobody from the warehouse is trained to use the software that uploads the data from the vCards, she said. That job is done by staff in the bureau of elections department or the information technology liaison.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
