The “Unite the Right” rally was partly organized by a well-known white nationalist, Richard Spencer, and included both neo-Nazis and white supremacist groups. Former Ku Klux Klan head David Duke was a scheduled speaker. The cause they were protesting — the removal of Lee’s statue — is one supported by many nonwhite supremacists and nonwhite nationalists, but this rally was clearly not one for your average supporter of Confederate monuments. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/08/very-fine-people-charlottesville-who-were-they-2/\">Fact Checker investigation</a> found there were white supremacists, there were counter protesters -- and there were heavily armed anti-government militias who showed up on Saturday. The militia groups were not spurred on by the Confederate statue controversy. They arrived in Charlottesville heavily armed and, by their own account, were prepared to use deadly force — because of a desire to insert themselves in a dangerous situation that, in effect, pitted them against the foes of white supremacists.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"26291, 25764, 22472, 10127, 10214, 18702","repeated_count":"6","date":"08/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
