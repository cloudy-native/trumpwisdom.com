A woman, an elderly woman, walks in looking forward to voting November 3rd and says, ‘Oh, good, where would I go about voting?’ ‘I'm sorry, you’ve already voted. Your ballot is in.’ She said, ‘No, I didn't vote.’ ‘No, your ballot is in. You’ve already voted.’ In all cases for Biden, by the way … and then they gave her a provisional ballot to sign, which goes nowhere.”","analysis":"This has been a persistent claim by the Trump campaign in various states — that Trump supporters went to vote, only to find their ballot had already been cast (presumably by Democratic operatives) and thus they were given a provisional ballot.

(Obviously, the problem can exist and appears to result from clerical errors. There is no evidence it occurs in great numbers, is intentional, or disadvantages one party more than then the other.)","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31117, 30817, 30795, 30762, 31413, 30716","repeated_count":"6","date":"11/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
