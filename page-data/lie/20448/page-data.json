Absentee ballots are fine. Like I live in the White House, and if I can't get to Florida, or you live wherever you live, and you can't. But you have to go through a process. Some people just can't make it to a polling station, and they have good reason. … [But] there is tremendous evidence of fraud whenever you have mail-in ballots.”","analysis":"This is nonsense. Absentee and mail-in ballots are essentially the same. Both require voters to register first. Trump indicates that he sometimes votes by mail out of necessity, but CNN reported that he voted by mail at times when he could have gone in-person. Most states do not require a reason for absentee voting, though some do require an excuse.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
