Trump is adding up three (or sometimes four) fiscal years of military funding, but the money is not all spent, only a portion of it is destined for new equipment, and the equipment is not all built. The actual amount spent on military equipment since he became president is much less, about 20 percent of the total. The rest was spent on things like personnel, operations and maintenance, and research and development. Trump's spending on military equipment is not particularly new or unusual.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"31588, 31574, 31164, 30939, 31406, 29841, 29928, 30302, 30533, 29246, 29267, 29383, 29442, 29637, 29538, 29710, 29956, 29992, 28880, 28892, 29040, 28672, 28459, 28575, 27684, 28802, 28995, 28079, 28170, 28339, 27996, 27602, 27844, 27899, 27633, 27732, 28236, 26788, 26839, 26674, 27479, 27188, 27325, 27511, 26388, 26465, 26211, 26108, 25699, 25571, 25469, 25501, 25523, 25439, 25261, 25271, 25299, 26576, 25122, 25054, 24912, 24965, 24763, 24810, 24859, 24731, 24645, 23768, 23781, 23786, 23851, 23682, 23484, 23574, 23584, 23270, 23064, 22091, 22003, 21958, 22384, 20994, 22496, 21584, 21601, 22539, 21157, 22179, 21235, 21486, 21620, 21402, 21448, 20796, 20856, 20738, 20017, 19933, 20210, 20193, 19819, 18957, 18831, 17803, 17600, 17790, 17483, 17048, 18357, 16896, 16845, 16780, 16496, 16147, 16402, 16056, 16424","repeated_count":"117","date":"10/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
