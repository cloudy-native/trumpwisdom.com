Because next April you're going to, in many cases, one page, one card. It's going to be very, very different. Very, very different. But you'll have a nice, simple form next year. This will be the last year. So take pictures of it and enjoy it. This is the last time you'll have to file a very complex and big tax form. It will be much easier starting next April.”","analysis":"The tax bill did not simplify taxes and there are no plans by the IRS to introduce a postcard sized form. This was a talking point by Republicans when the process started but it was eventually dropped as the legislation became more complicated.
