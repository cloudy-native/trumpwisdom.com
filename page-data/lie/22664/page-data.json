And we'll see what happens with that.”","analysis":"It has been reported that an FBI informant in Europe, a professor named Stefan Halper, met with at least three people working on the Trump campaign in Europe. So far, it's unclear whether there was a political agenda or a “spy” mandate as part of Halper's assistance for the FBI, which started after the agency opened a counterintelligence probe. The New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/us/politics/fbi-government-investigator-trump.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">reported</a> that Halper's work for the FBI  was overseen by a woman who called herself Azra Turk; she met at one point in September with George Papadopoulos, a Trump foreign policy aide, and asked whether the campaign was working with Russia. There is no evidence Halper was paid a \"fortune,\" as Trump often claims. (Trump appears to be referring to payments made for an unrelated project for the Defense Department, which started before Trump announced his campaign for presidency). The FISA surveillance warrant on Carter Page, a one time campaign aide to Trump, was issued after Page had left the campaign. None of this amounts to Trump's false claim in 2017 that Obama put a wiretap on him. The DOJ Inspector General, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf#page=18\">in a report issued in 2019</a>, found no evidence that such confidential sources interacted with the campaign before the investigation was started or that any were placed on the campaign.
