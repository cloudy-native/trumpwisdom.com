So they're smuggling in women and they're smuggling in children. And they're using the children, in particular, as pawns, who are getting other people into our country. Because when you're with a child, even if the child is not yours -- which in itself is ridiculous -- then it's much easier to come across and come into our country because the laws are very bad.”","analysis":"False. U.S. law actually does the opposite. Fraudulent representations to immigration authorities, including false claims of parentage, are grounds for denying entry and, depending on the circumstances, could also lead to criminal prosecution.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
