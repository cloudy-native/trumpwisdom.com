If we kept the oil, we would have been okay. If we kept the oil, we wouldn’t have ISIS. … That’s how they funded themselves.”","analysis":"This claim is problematic in multiple ways. First, invading and then seizing the resources of a sovereign nation would violate the Geneva Conventions. Second, taking Iraq’s oil would be logistically impossible with the troop levels committed by the United States, and would ultimately cost more than the oil is worth, experts say. Third, the Islamic State might still exist, and still might be able to fund itself, without Iraqi oil proceeds. Oil was not the most significant revenue source for ISIS in 2015, and in any case, ISIS in recent years has derived more revenue from Syrian than Iraqi oil.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/29/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
