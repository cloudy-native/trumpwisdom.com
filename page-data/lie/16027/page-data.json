Qasem Soleimani planned an imminent attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, let alone four embassies as Trump  has claimed. Administration officials gave conflicting accounts and have contradicted each other about how imminent a threat Soleimani posed, whether they had specific intelligence on the threat and even what that threat was. Six weeks after his death, the White House released a memo justifying the U.S. strike but it made no mention of an imminent threat. Instead, the memo said the Soleimani strike was carried out in response to previous attacks and to deter Iran from conducting or supporting attacks in the future.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"16910, 16027, 16103, 16154, 16576, 16054, 16061","repeated_count":"7","date":"01/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
