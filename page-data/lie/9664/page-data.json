And they say you can add 10 percent -- because 10 percent of the people love us, but they're ashamed to say, 'That I'm voting for the president.' I don't care, they're ashamed.”","analysis":"It's unclear what polls Trump is citing, though he often refers to Rasmussen, which consistently has a Republican-leaning bias; it fell to 50 percent the next day. As of the date of this tweet, Rasmussen's poll showed Trump with 51 percent approval. The polling gurus at FiveThirtyEight say that an adjusted rating would have shown Trump at 45 percent in the poll. On the day of the tweet, Trump had an average approval of 41.9 percent in 538's blended poll rating, along with 52.8 percent disapproval. There is no evidence that people are ashamed to say they support Trump, let alone that the number is as high as ten percent.
