I didn't say they're going to write me a check for $20 billion or $10 billion. No one is going to write a check. I said they're going to pay for the wall.”","analysis":"Trump promised Mexico would pay for the wall over 200 times during the 2016 campaign. When he was specifically asked how he would make this happen, he said would threaten to cut off the flow of billions of dollars that Mexican immigrants sent home unless Mexico immediately made a “one-time payment” of $5 billion to $10 billion. He also suggested other intimidation tactics, including increased trade tariffs, the cancellation of visas and higher fees for border-crossing cards. Trump may not have specified check, credit card or wire-transfer, but a \"one-time payment\" has the same implication.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
