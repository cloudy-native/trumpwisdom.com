That's when China really ascended. That's when China went up. That's when they made their great rise. They were flat lining, and then, all of a sudden, around the year 2000, 2001, when they got involved with the WTO, it became a whole different story.”","analysis":"Most economists would agree that China’s industrial rise caused millions of job losses in the United States and thousands of factory closures. There’s no definitive estimate of how many of these jobs were lost or how many of these factories closed specifically because of China. The research on this question is limited, indicating that China had an outsize impact but that there were other factors at play, such as automation.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
