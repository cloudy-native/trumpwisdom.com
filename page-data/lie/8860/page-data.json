So when I took over, we had one man that put on more debt than every other President combined. Combine them all. So you can't be talking about that.”","analysis":"This is a misleading claim <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/12/08/does-obama-have-the-worst-record-on-any-president-on-the-national-debt/?utm_term=.fd3d72b8018e\">we have debunked before</a>. Trump is talking about raw dollars, but every president inherits a debt from the previous one, making it virtually certain that the pile of debt is going to grow. A lot of that new debt is on automatic pilot — from programs such as Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThere are more informative ways to measure a president’s impact on the national debt. One way is percentage increase, and under that metric, Obama is in fifth place: Franklin D. Roosevelt (1,048 percent), Woodrow Wilson (729 percent), Ronald Reagan (186 percent), George W. Bush (101 percent) and Obama (74 percent).\n\nOne alternative method looks at the dollar amount of the debt increase divided by the dollar amount of gross domestic product at the end of each presidential term. Under that metric, Obama would have the worst record of recent presidents but would still trail Roosevelt and Wilson among presidents in the past 100 years.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
