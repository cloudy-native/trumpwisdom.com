The RAISE Act would keep new immigrants from going on welfare for five years. Isn't that nice? They don't walk over and say I'm going on welfare. Isn't that nice. Maybe keep them from ever going on welfare. And would require them to support themselves and their families financially.”","analysis":"In general, legal permanent residents already can't \"come in immediately and start picking up welfare.\" The five-year ban that Trump suggests already exists, and new immigrants are not eligible for the major federal public assistance programs during those years. There are some exceptions, such as refugees and asylees, or people with military connections.
