The Obama administration scaled back the federal government's program of providing surplus military gear such as tanks and weapons to local police departments, a response to the images of militarized police during the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014. But Obama's restrictions clearly laid out a category of \"controlled equipment\" such as specialized firearms, manned and unmanned aircraft, explosives and riot gear that could still be provided upon demonstrated need.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"25681, 20958, 22528, 22996, 22722, 21673","repeated_count":"6","date":"07/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
