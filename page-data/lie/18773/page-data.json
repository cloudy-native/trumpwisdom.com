Because that was the single worst decision made in this country's history -- the single worst, getting into the Middle East.”","analysis":"This is a signature Trump lie. We searched high and low — as did other reporters — and there is no evidence Trump was an opponent of the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, let alone a vocal one. In fact, he offered lukewarm support. When Howard Stern asked if he supported invading Iraq, Trump replied, “Yeah, I guess so. You know, I wish the first time it was done correctly.” In another interview on Fox News, two months before the invasion, he said Bush had to make a decision: “Either you attack or you don't attack.” Shortly after the invasion, he again told Fox News: “It looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.” Not until August 2004, in an interview with Esquire, did Trump publicly express opposition to the war. By then — 17 months after the invasion — many Americans had turned against the war, making Trump’s position not particularly unique. (We include this claim when Trump attacks Biden for supporting an invasion of Iraq since he never acknowledges his own support.)\n","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"31341, 28843, 27929, 26833, 24769, 22101, 20999, 21209, 21266, 20011, 19925, 18773, 18054, 17610, 14705, 14104, 14231, 13912, 12778, 13586, 13323, 12628, 11331, 7714, 7246, 3770, 0060","repeated_count":"27","date":"05/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
