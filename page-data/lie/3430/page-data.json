You ever hear of thing like that?  Judges.  Well, we're appointing 145 judges here, and everyone goes through this extreme vetting process.  You're talking about 5,000.  Where do you find 5,000 people to be judges?”","analysis":"It’s not clear who told Trump 5,000 judges were needed. But this claim defies logic. The United States had 334 immigration judges as of mid-April, and a top official at the National Association of Immigration Judges says an additional 365 judges would be needed to get through the backlog. A bill by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) would increase the total number of judges to 750, not 5,000. All the Article III judges, hearing all sorts of federal cases, at all the different levels, number only 1,300 or so — not in the thousands.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"4289, 3893, 4182, 3438, 3430, 3435, 3569, 3999, 3978, 3488, 3950","repeated_count":"11","date":"06/25/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
