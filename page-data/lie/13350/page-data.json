The military budget had declined in recent years, as a result of decreases in funding for Overseas Contingency Operations as both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan came to a close, not because it's been so gravely depleted. Trump frequently says his military budgets are biggest in history, but adjusted for inflation his administration's budgets lag some years during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The biggest defense budget was in 2010, and in inflation-adjusted dollars it is nearly ten percent larger than Trump's 2020 budget.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"31614, 31304, 31163, 30981, 30942, 30859, 31448, 31409, 31454, 30340, 29903, 30172, 30305, 29241, 29266, 29443, 29539, 29711, 29957, 30026, 28951, 28683, 27621, 27601, 27853, 27909, 26737, 26774, 27071, 27326, 25723, 25452, 25504, 25421, 25445, 25332, 25141, 25927, 25100, 24876, 24886, 24911, 24764, 24824, 24665, 24732, 24442, 24199, 24251, 24110, 24009, 23793, 23457, 23703, 23367, 23220, 23226, 23234, 23237, 23151, 23157, 23042, 22026, 22076, 20933, 22518, 22924, 22976, 21167, 21315, 21236, 22711, 21401, 22598, 21078, 20776, 20604, 20558, 19932, 20209, 20194, 19818, 18717, 18833, 18812, 19682, 19715, 19597, 19623, 19575, 18766, 18595, 19050, 18030, 17618, 18461, 17568, 17764, 16998, 18381, 18377, 16951, 17358, 18270, 18329, 16823, 16661, 16146, 16367, 16376, 15959, 15879, 16257, 15423, 14427, 15800, 13782, 13827, 14778, 15702, 15553, 14245, 15477, 14113, 14651, 13986, 14009, 13772, 13864, 13509, 13594, 12869, 13424, 12862, 13411, 13350, 13359, 12796, 12804, 12739, 12702, 12618, 12537, 12392, 12330, 11593, 11695, 11682, 11522, 11553, 12142, 12127, 12069, 12079, 12116, 12198, 12018, 11978, 11281, 11300, 11501, 11213, 11812, 11724, 10834, 10798, 10721, 10602, 10768, 10388, 10554, 10335, 10165, 10081, 10059, 10060, 9861, 9727, 9367, 9117, 9052, 8843, 8707, 8529, 8557, 8404, 8021, 8088, 7937, 7853, 7724, 7735, 7369, 7402, 7533, 7174, 6696, 6865, 6942, 6978, 7137, 7143, 6835, 6614, 6780, 7076, 6030, 6313, 6228, 6021, 6178, 6181, 6418, 6119, 5933, 5323, 5233, 5134, 5644, 4839, 5004, 5026, 4561, 4311, 4095, 4044, 3160, 2996, 2858, 2606, 2855, 2803, 2407, 2287, 2199, 2253, 2234, 2144, 2049, 1974, 1912, 1932, 1900, 1821, 1773, 1776, 1777, 1654, 1649, 0259","repeated_count":"250","date":"09/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
