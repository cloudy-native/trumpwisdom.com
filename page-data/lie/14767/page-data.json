I know he was going to go to Ukraine and I think he canceled a trip. But, you know, Rudy has other clients other than me. I'm one person....No, I didn't direct him but he's a warrior, Rudy's a warrior. Rudy went, he possibly saw something....I think he's done work in Ukraine for years.”","analysis":"Trump, without credibility, is trying to distance himself from his attorney, Rudolph Giuliani, and his involvement in the Ukraine scandal. But Trump directed people to deal to Giuliani matters. \"Well, when the president says talk to my personal attorney and then Mr. Giuliani as his personal attorney makes certain requests or demands,\" testified U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, \"we assume it's coming from the president. I don't— I don't— I'm not testifying that I heard the president tell Mr. Giuliani to tell us, so if that's your question.\" Trump also told Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to get in touch with his attorney during their phone call on July 25. \"Mr. Giuliani is a highly respected man,\" Trump said. \"I will ask him to call you along with the Attorney General. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy.\" A letter from Giuliani to Zelensky later emerged, with Giuliani writing:  “In my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent, I request a meeting with you” during his planned visit.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
