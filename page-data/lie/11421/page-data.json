And why not? Why would Honduras or Guatemala or El Salvador, why would they keep their criminals when you can put them into the caravan, lose them in a caravan, and send them up to the United States.”","analysis":"Any large caravan is going to have some bad apples. In the January caravan, Mexican officials have already identified several and deported criminals aiming to make the trek, so they are no longer a potential threat. Still, numbers issued by DHS are roughly consistent with the percentage of people with criminal pasts — 5 percent — in the 2014 surge. In other words, it may not be completely out of line to mention criminals though Trump's claims seem to be hyped.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"11421, 8827, 8600, 8641, 8329, 7719, 7732, 7703, 7577, 7578, 7327, 7331, 7515, 7546, 7521, 7522, 7535, 7506, 6728, 6958, 6982, 7102, 7105, 7106, 7149, 6798, 6817, 6515, 6605, 6748, 6752, 6753, 7031, 7032, 7034, 7075, 7087, 7093, 6534, 6536, 6548, 6549, 6558, 6630, 6652, 6653, 6268, 6269, 6293, 6231, 5984, 6011, 6187, 6196, 6197, 5202, 6334, 6340, 6354, 6355, 6135, 6137, 6159, 6422, 6455, 6456, 6457, 6458, 6468, 5458, 5461, 5489, 5491","repeated_count":"73","date":"07/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
