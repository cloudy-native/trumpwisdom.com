Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was racist and deserving of news coverage. Trump suggests a double standard because the media does not treat seriously his false attacks on several congresswomen. When Omar made anti-Semitic remarks suggesting that Jews buy influence in Congress, the episode was widely covered for weeks. However, Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that some Democratic congresswomen of color have said racist or \"vile\" things. For example, he claimed Omar once professed support for al-Qaeda, but that was a falsehood. He also falsely claimed that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) disparaged Americans as \"garbage\" (she didn't).","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
