You know that. Carolyn Maloney, they gave her an election, that they can't even find the ballots and they gave her a victory, and they can't find that the guy that is against her, who did very well, even though he's even more progressive. I don't even know what she is. I've known her for 25 years. I don't think she's progressive, I think she's whatever she has to be. But this guy, probably, will possibly beat her. So rightfully, he's not too happy and they call the election for her and they can't find the ballots.”","analysis":"Results were delayed for several weeks in a New York congressional primary, with Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) eventually declared the winner. Trump falsely suggested fraud was afoot, when no such allegation has been leveled. “Let’s be clear, the issue in my race was disenfranchisement, not voter fraud. More than 1 in 5 ballots were discarded, many multiples of the final margin,” Suraj Patel, Maloney’s opponent, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/surajpatelnyc/status/1311135111644155909\">wrote on Twitter</a>. “We called our election a canary in the coal mine for November, we were right.
