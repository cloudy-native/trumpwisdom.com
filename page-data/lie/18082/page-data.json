We lose -- we have deaths of that per year. Worldwide, it's hundreds of thousands of deaths from the common flu. And they ask, you know, what's the difference and how does this differ, and I guess there are things that are similar and things that are different.”","analysis":"Trump initially kept making inappropriate comparisons between the coronavirus and the seasonal flu. The new coronavirus appears to have a much higher fatality rate than the seasonal flu, possibly 10 times higher, but the outbreak was too new for a firm death rate to be determined. Moreover, it’s a new virus, not yet a seasonal one, although it’s possible covid-19 will become seasonal in the future. The death toll for the seasonal flu is an estimate calculated several years later, as a measure of excess mortality, because the flu often contributes to deaths, while not being recorded as the cause of death.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"19251, 19111, 17923, 17944, 18516, 17950, 17833, 18495, 18479, 17804, 18082, 17766, 17796, 18447","repeated_count":"14","date":"03/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
