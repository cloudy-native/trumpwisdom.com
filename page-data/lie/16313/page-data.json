That was a killer for the Democrats, right? Then, his foreign minister said the same thing. He said there was no pressure exerted whatsoever.”","analysis":"U.S. officials have testified to Congress that Zelensky’s government knew the Trump administration was delaying security assistance funds and that the Ukrainian leader was preparing to give CNN an interview in which he would announce the investigations Trump wanted. The interview was later canceled, but Trump is stretching Zelensky’s comments. After Trump released the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call with Zelensky, the Ukrainian president said “no one can pressure me.” Zelensky also criticized Trump for holding up U.S. security funds appropriated by Congress. “If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us,” Zelensky told Time magazine. “I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about a quid pro quo.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"19615, 19015, 17010, 18340, 17052, 16728, 16805, 16631, 16517, 16670, 16586, 16098, 16036, 16030, 16313, 15987, 15852, 15938, 15233, 15404, 15845, 14574, 14584, 15794, 14924, 14730, 14454, 14327, 15731, 15751, 14718, 14727, 15252, 15454, 15496, 14308, 15171, 14370, 14106, 14182, 13903, 13932, 13751, 13795, 13802, 13806, 12860, 13609, 13516, 13577, 13039, 13050, 12890, 13428, 13230, 13184, 12873","repeated_count":"57","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
