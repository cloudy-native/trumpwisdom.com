U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement reports yearly arrest totals without breaking down the type of offense, which could be anything from homicide to a DUI to illegal entry. Notice how Trump switches quickly from the 266,000 arrests over two years to charges and convictions: “100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.” In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, so that switch gives a confusing picture.\n\nIn fiscal 2018, ICE conducted 158,581 administrative arrests for civil immigration violations. The agency’s year-end report says two-thirds (105,140) of those involved people with criminal convictions and one-fifth (32,977) involved people with pending criminal charges. Of the 143,470 administrative arrests in 2017, 74 percent involved people with criminal records and 15.5 percent involved people who had pending charges. But these totals cover all types of offenses — including illegal entry or reentry.\n\nIn the fiscal 2018 breakdown, 16 percent of all the charges and convictions were immigration and related offenses.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26673, 9553, 9265, 9134, 8783, 8738, 8625, 8490, 7809, 7764","repeated_count":"10","date":"01/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
