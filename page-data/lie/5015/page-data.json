Everybody came out -- almost everybody -- came out where there are quotes like General Kelly, General Mattis, so many different people they came out. And they really hit the book hard, because they didn't say the things that it was attributed.”","analysis":"Trump is criticizing \"Fear,\" a book by Bob Woodward that portrays the Trump presidency as coming off the rails. Woodward relied on sources who in many cases were not identified, as is his long-standing practice. Woodward says he has hundreds of hours of taped interviews with sources who have direct knowledge of the events described in the book. Reporting by major media outlets about the inner workings of the Trump administration in many cases corroborates Woodward's reporting in \"Fear.\" An associate editor of The Post renowned for his Watergate reporting, Woodward has written about the inner workings of both Democratic and Republican administrations since the 1970s.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"23887, 8539, 4896, 5022, 4780, 4813, 4984, 4985, 5015, 4934, 4937, 4958, 4959, 4960, 4963, 4964, 4749, 4751, 4752","repeated_count":"19","date":"09/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
