However, critics of the JCPOA have voiced concerns that — despite these strictures — Iran could keep working toward nuclear weapons capability under the guise of pursuing peaceful goals, such as a nuclear energy program. Trump is alluding to the fact that some restrictions in the JCPOA on centrifuge capacity, uranium enrichment and international monitoring sunset over time. Our European allies have vocally expressed their displeasure with the United States' decision to withdraw from the agreement.
