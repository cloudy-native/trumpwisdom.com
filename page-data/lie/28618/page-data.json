The Great Recession was caused by a meltdown in the financial industry, making it one of the more difficult types of recessions to rebuild from. The pandemic recession temporarily suspended millions of jobs, but the financial system remained relatively strong. In fact, as Trump often noted, the stock market quickly recovered.
