So all of these numbers are inflated. Moreover, even if you counting January jobs, that brings the total to 533,000. The correct figure is 317,000. The other corrected jobs numbers are: construction (65,000); manufacturing (37,000) and mining (21,000). Obviously, a new president has little influence over broad economic trends.
