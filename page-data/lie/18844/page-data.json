Between December 26 and December 30, China’s media highlighted evidence of a new virus emerging from Wuhan, based on patient data sent to multiple Chinese genomics companies. Additionally, during this period, Dr. Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told China’s health authorities that a new coronavirus was causing a novel disease that was, at the time, afflicting approximately 180 patients.”","analysis":"Doctors in Wuhan suspected person-to-person transmission of the new disease in mid- to late December, and one company even completed genomic sequencing of the novel coronavirus on Dec. 26, according to a Chinese media report. But the letter uses sleight of hand to suggest Zhang knew at the time that 180 patients were sick. “On December 27, Zhang Jixian, a doctor from Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, told China’s health authorities that the disease was caused by a new coronavirus,” reported the South China Morning Post. “By that date, more than 180 people had been infected, though doctors might not have been aware of all of them at the time.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
