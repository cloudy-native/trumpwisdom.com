Do you think that's fair? It's millions of ballots are going out. He's the governor of the state [of Nevada]. Do you think it's a fair thing, because I'm winning that state easily. But the one thing he can't beat, if they cheat on the ballots. Now, he'll cheat on the ballots. I have no doubt about it. This is the same man who's in charge of the ballots.”","analysis":"Trump frequently accused Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) of rigging the 2020 election in the state and abusing the mail voting process. The claim is ridiculous, as the governor does not run elections in Nevada. That job falls to the secretary of state, which in 2020 was Republican Barbara Cegavske. There is no evidence of voter fraud on any significant scale in Nevada.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"24322, 24174, 24263, 24139, 24168, 24041, 24044, 24046, 24070, 23918","repeated_count":"10","date":"09/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
