Probably not legal, but I'm going to sign it anyway.’ And so everybody thought that it was going to be easily overturned by the judge. And the judge amazingly ruled in favor of that signing, even though President Obama didn't think it was going to hold up as he signed it. He said it. Go back and check. And then you had it upheld in the Ninth Circuit, on appeal.”","analysis":"These comments are confusing and wrong in several ways. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) met with Trump in early September 2017 and then announced they had a tentative deal that extended DACA but did not fund the border wall, although they did agree to include some form of border security measures. Trump took a beating from his right-wing supporters after that announcement, and days later tweeted that there was no deal with Pelosi and Schumer. No judge had ruled to uphold DACA in the interim. Meanwhile, Obama never said his executive order on DACA was illegal. His administration argued in court that the order was “a lawful exercise of the enforcement discretion that Congress delegated to the executive branch in the Immigration and Nationality Act, which charges the executive with ‘the administration and enforcement’ of the country’s immigration laws,” as the ACLU put it.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"21111, 20798, 19992, 17340, 10760, 8412, 7978, 7983, 7895, 7896, 7745, 7299, 7453, 7471, 3511, 2642, 2810, 2808, 2605, 2602, 2608, 2609, 2618, 2599, 2600, 2612, 2582, 2528, 2474, 2476, 2477, 2406, 2431, 2382, 2433, 2442, 2314, 2264, 2272, 2274, 2275, 2233, 2305, 2307, 2232, 2202, 2169, 2170, 2173, 2177, 2139, 2086, 2058, 2065, 2059, 2060","repeated_count":"56","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
