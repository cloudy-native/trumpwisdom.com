They threw ballots into a river from the military with my name all over it. We want Trump, boom, goes into the river.”","analysis":"Trump appears to make a Frankenstein-claim out of two separate, previous stories of missing ballots. The president often says a large number of “military ballots” were found in a “garbage can” in Pennsylvania. Luzerne County, Pa., officials explained in a statement that a “temporary seasonal independent contractor … incorrectly discarded [nine ballots] into the office trash” during that person’s three-day period of employment. The county’s top election official caught wind, fired the employee and launched an investigation. The Justice Department at first said all nine ballots were for Trump, violating ballot secrecy, before issuing an unusual correction to note that, actually, seven were for Trump. The department did not, however, say how many — if any — of these ballots were from military personnel.\n\nSometimes the president claims that Trump ballots were dumped in a river. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany previously explained that this claim was a reference to an investigation in Wisconsin. Some lost mail in Wisconsin {was found} on the side of a road and in a ditch line in Greenville, a small town of about 12,000 people outside the city of Appleton. The mail was supposed to be in transit to the post office, according to the Outagamie County Sheriff’s Office. “Several” absentee ballots were found among three “trays” of mail, according to the sheriff’s office. Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe announced that she'd been informed by post office officials that no Wisconsin ballots were among the lost mail.\n\nRegardless, it is not clear how the president mashed these two false tales together. There is no evidence that military ballots “with Trump all over it” were thrown into a river.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/04/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
