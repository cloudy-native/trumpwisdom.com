It's very very tough. And yet they send their product to us -- no taxes, very little taxes, it's very unfair. I've had a lot of problems with the European Union.”","analysis":"Trump is wrong here. As a World Trade Organization member, countries in the European Union face the “Most Favored Nation tariff” when they export a product to the United States. There is a potentially different tariff for every product exported to the United States, countries have negotiated various reductions (product-by-product) with US negotiators since 1947. On average, across all products, the US MFN tariff is 3.5 percent – so on average that is what a company from the EU would pay.\r\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"25726, 16736, 16772, 16784, 14654, 15813, 15690, 14002, 12940, 13283, 12517, 12428, 11198, 11561, 11462, 11467, 11248, 11838, 11726, 10481, 10358, 10252, 10034, 9657, 9429, 8996, 9001, 7832, 7326, 7417, 7489, 6574, 6295, 6192, 6116, 6319, 6083, 5293, 5824, 5252, 5671, 5641, 4585, 3687, 3675, 3876, 4189, 4190, 3806, 4211, 4218, 3644, 3650, 3739, 4120, 4085, 3601, 3839, 4048, 4060, 3442, 3572, 3991, 3914, 3401, 3361, 3294, 3334, 3221, 3001, 2952, 2717, 2674, 2758, 2759, 2793, 2615, 2495, 2484, 2470, 2359","repeated_count":"81","date":"01/28/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
