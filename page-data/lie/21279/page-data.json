They'd make a right and then a left into the United States.”","analysis":"Mentioning women trafficked with tape over their mouths has become a standard part of Trump’s talking points on the need for a border wall. But human-trafficking experts and advocates for immigrant women have said they are perplexed by this tale in Trump’s repertoire — and are at a loss for where he got his information. No prominent news reports have detailed a case that matches the president’s description. (The New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/border-mexico-women.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytpolitics\">reported</a> on March 1 it had found some instances of women being duct-taped and trafficked across the border, but “If the president was suggesting that such savagery occurs daily on America’s southern border, then he was indeed exaggerating.”)","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"24554, 24149, 21279, 13707, 10886, 8968, 8826, 8791, 8488, 8387, 7841, 7842, 7840, 7839, 8255, 7837, 7838, 7972","repeated_count":"18","date":"08/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
