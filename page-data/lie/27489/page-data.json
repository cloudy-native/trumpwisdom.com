I call it the super-duper. It goes 5 times faster than a normal missile, right? We have one goes much faster than that, but Russia got that information from the Obama administration. Russia stole that information. You know that, you know that. Russia got the information and they built it, but we have no one that's much faster, much faster than that.”","analysis":"We have no idea why Trump claims that during the Obama administration Russian stole the information for hypersonic weapons, namely hypersonic glide vehicles (HGV) that can reach speeds of at least Mach 5, or roughly 3,800 mph. Russia <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.defenseworld.net/news/27881/Moscow_Rubbishes_Trump_Claim_that_Russia_Stole_Hypersonic_Missile_Info_from_US#.X-O1JulKiF0\">denies</a> Trump's claim, though that would be expected. (Russian president Vladimir Putin said Moscow began working on hypersonic weapons after U.S. pulled out of Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002.) But Trump has offered no evidence either and has his own track record of falsehoods as well documented here.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"27851, 27912, 28330, 27481, 27489","repeated_count":"5","date":"09/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
