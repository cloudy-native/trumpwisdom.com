He takes credit for increased defense spending by NATO members even though those increases began years before he became president, after Russia invaded Crimea. The $530 billion figure is just bonkers and wrong. NATO members (not including the United States) are expected to spend an additional $400 billion by 2024, not $530 billion as Trump claims.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"17338, 16791, 16645, 16132, 16042, 16360, 15927, 15240, 15011, 15015, 14485, 14490, 14631, 15218, 15807","repeated_count":"15","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
