I said, \"Oh, I'm going to sign this, because I know how bad it is. I'm going to get killed.\" And I didn't, because everybody knew how bad. It's got the most beautiful title -- the disastrous Waters of the United States rule....It means you couldn't farm your land. It means you couldn't build houses on your land. It means you couldn't do anything with your land. If you had a little puddle on your land -- you heard this -- it was considered, for purposes of that rule, a lake. And you came under restrictions and regulations that made it impossible to go anywhere near it. Honestly, it was insane.”","analysis":"The Obama-era Waters of the United States rule technically has an exemption for puddles. But opponents of the rule argue say since a “puddle” is not defined in the rule, the EPA can still regulate what some people may consider puddles.
