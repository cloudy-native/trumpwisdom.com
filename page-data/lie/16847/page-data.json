Congress inserted specific language in its appropriations bill that none of the $1.57 billion appropriated for border protection may be used for prototypes of a concrete wall that Trump observed while in California. The money can be used only for bollard fencing and levee fencing, or for replacement of existing fencing. The same restrictions were included in the spending bill Trump signed on Feb. 15, 2019. Trump appears to acknowledge the renovations, except he persists in claiming it is a wall. All told, Congress has funded about 175 miles of barriers. Trump has also tapped a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund to build 30 miles and unused Pentagon funding to fund 53 miles, though he's run into trouble in the courts over the use of these funds. Replacing dilapidated vehicle barriers and weathered fencing with newer, sturdier stuff is the kind of routine government business that predated Trump. As of the end of November 2020, only 25 miles of his border barrier had been built on land where there had been no previous barrier. It’s fair to say Trump is trying to put this routine business on steroids, but that’s still a far cry from the massive new bulwark made of concrete that he promised for so long. The Washington Post has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/smugglers-are-sawing-through-new-sections-of-trumps-border-wall/2019/11/01/25bf8ce0-fa72-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html\">reported</a> that the bollard fencing is easily breached, with smugglers sawing through it, despite Trump's claims that it is impossible to get past. Nevertheless, the project has diverted billions in military and counternarcotics funding to become one of the largest infrastructure projects in U.S. history, seizing private land, cutting off wildlife corridors and disrupting Native American cultural sites.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"18949, 18572, 17966, 17876, 18456, 18478, 17769, 18411, 17435, 17523, 18352, 17285, 17397, 17055, 18290, 16847, 16718, 16689, 16136, 16208, 16392, 15965, 16012, 15444, 15241, 14082, 14779, 14796, 14915, 14570, 15698, 15577, 15606, 15192, 14076, 14608, 15124, 13947, 15075, 13859, 13549, 13043, 13162, 12914, 12963, 13394, 13017, 12792, 12800, 12814, 13011, 13666, 12727, 12762, 13338, 13339, 12685, 12711, 12719, 13316, 13132, 13290, 12520, 12572, 12358, 12431, 12309, 12607, 11617, 11532, 12153, 12086, 11431, 12051, 12247, 12035, 12000, 11949, 11921, 11505, 11438, 11897, 11842, 11783, 11751, 11728, 10813, 10962, 10719, 10454, 10582, 10611, 10677, 10490, 10876, 10325, 10344, 10307, 10255, 10193, 10172, 10097, 9768, 10083, 10008, 10019, 9906, 9842, 9928, 9957, 9854, 9892, 9730, 9733, 9734, 9743, 9751, 9754, 9812, 9601, 9612, 9502, 9582, 9448, 9328, 9295, 9303, 9243, 9207, 9236, 9226, 9102, 9041, 8978, 8907, 8932, 8875, 8809, 8840, 8850, 8771, 8780, 8769, 8770, 8792, 8679, 8694, 8437, 8553, 8559, 8588, 8414, 8316, 8295, 8270, 7805, 7786, 8165, 8201, 8249, 8076, 7985, 7952, 7898, 7720, 7705, 7652, 7432, 7552, 7339, 7388, 6998, 7167, 7445, 6698, 6729, 7101, 7146, 6858, 6513, 6750, 7030, 7085, 6628, 6289, 6244, 6203, 6338, 6352, 6160, 6412, 6427, 6466, 5467, 5924, 5854, 5409, 6085, 5344, 5510, 5816, 5196, 5272, 5748, 5117, 5661, 5662, 5682, 5061, 4827, 4832, 4866, 4922, 4948, 4772, 4690, 4636, 4650, 4374, 4463, 4434, 4389, 4653, 4535, 4305, 4524, 4238, 3898, 4194, 4151, 4057, 3450, 3567, 4001, 3976, 3525, 3909, 3386, 3412, 3258, 3260, 3196, 3173, 3121, 3072, 2967, 2900, 2678, 2663, 2876, 2660, 2819, 2836, 2662, 2857, 2661, 2854, 2848","repeated_count":"258","date":"01/28/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
