So Trump’s wall would do little to halt drug trafficking. Trump’s repeated claim that the wall would stop drug trafficking is a Bottomless Pinocchio claim.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
