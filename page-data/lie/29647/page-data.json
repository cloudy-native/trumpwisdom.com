But contrary to Trump's claims, he does not want to eliminate guns or prevent gun ownership. As a candidate, Biden supports universal background checks and a ban on the manufacture and sale of semiautomatic rifles and higher-capacity magazines, along with tighter regulation or the buyback of those weapons currently in private hands. He also would limit the ability of Americans to buy more than one gun a month.","pinocchios":"","category":"Guns","repeated_ids":"30916, 29770, 29870, 30145, 30187, 30242, 30439, 29273, 29322, 29404, 29647, 29660, 29497, 30099, 28704, 28881, 28932, 28635, 28417, 28513, 28601, 28836, 28150, 28262, 27582, 27813, 27905, 27925, 27648, 27752, 27017, 26756, 26786, 26622, 26689, 26701, 27409, 26980, 27100, 27215, 27239, 27312, 27443, 26339, 26418, 25540, 25515, 25418, 25337, 25156, 25606, 25234, 26542, 26604, 25804, 25944, 25978, 25817, 25871, 25091, 24631, 24372, 24134, 23349, 23817, 23879, 23446, 23616, 23730, 23469, 23245, 21987, 22068, 22362, 20938, 21011, 21630, 22402, 22409, 22505, 22514, 21647, 22194, 22235, 21361, 21387, 21397, 21502","repeated_count":"88","date":"11/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
