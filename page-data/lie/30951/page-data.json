According to the campaign, Warnock is referencing a Bible passage from Matthew 6:24 about serving two masters. He addressed Republicans' criticisms at a news conference. \"The gospel lesson says that you cannot serve God and mammon,\" Warnock told reporters. \"That a person can not have two masters. It is a spiritual lesson that is basic and foundational for people of faith. What I was expressing was the fact that as a person of faith, my ultimate allegiance is to God, and therefore, whatever else that I may commit myself to, it has to be built on a spiritual foundation. So, it's about priorities and about how one orders your priorities so that you can live a moral life.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
