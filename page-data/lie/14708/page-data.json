But about a year -- you'll have to check -- a year, year and a half before the World Trade Center came down, the book came out. I was talking about Osama bin Laden.”","analysis":"Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed that he predicted in his 2000 book that Osama bin Laden was going to attack the United States and that America needed to “take him out.” Trump’s book includes only a single, offhand reference to bin Laden. While Trump claims \"nobody\" had ever heard of him before the Sept. 11 attacks, the leader of al-Qaeda had already been the public target of U.S. warplanes for his role in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Moreover, a federal grand jury in 1998 indicted him for his role in the bombings.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
