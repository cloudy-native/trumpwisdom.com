But it’s wrong to describe it as a statistic that represents children being smuggled into the country. Border officials screen for false claims of parentage. To imply as Trump does that a child’s mother, father or legal guardian is or hired a smuggler, coyote or gang member in all of these cases is wrong.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8275, 8113, 7806, 7766, 8214, 7875","repeated_count":"6","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
