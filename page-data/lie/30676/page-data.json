Two Republicans on the Wayne County Board of Canvassers signed affidavits Wednesday saying they were bullied into voting to certify election results and are seeking to revoke their certification, though the deadline for such action has passed. The county, which encompasses Detroit and has more than 1.7 million residents, saw Biden beat Trump by more than a 2-1 margin.
