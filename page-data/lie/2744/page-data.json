These people have the biggest conflicts of interest I’ve ever seen.”","analysis":"Trump ignores the fact that the top officials involved in the investigation, such as special prosecutor Robert Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein are long-time Republicans. Nine members of Mueller’s team have made political donations to Democrats, compared to seven with no record of such donations. Five of the 16 known members contributed to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. In any case, the DOJ is legally barred from discriminating career appointees based on political affiliation. Trump has complained about \"massive\" conflicts of interest but he is exaggerating. Mueller received an ethics waiver from the Justice Department, for reason not disclosed. It is believed to be related to Mueller's work at the WilmerHale law firm, which also represented former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and White House adviser Jared Kushner, who is also President Donald Trump's son-in-law.
