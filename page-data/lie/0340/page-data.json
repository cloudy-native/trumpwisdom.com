I heard their stories, and I promised action and I promised them a solution. And all over America, you're already seeing solutions start to take place. Take a look at what's going on Michigan, with Ford and General Motors and Fiat-Chrysler, and so many more.”","analysis":"Trump keeps taking credit for projects that were long in the works before he became president. For example, he repeatedly claims credit for Ford’s decision to abandon its plans to open a factory in Mexico and instead expand its Michigan plant. But analysts say Ford’s decision has more to do with the company’s long-term goal — particularly, its plans to invest in electric vehicles — than the administration. It’s easier for companies to find highly skilled workers to build new products, such as electric cars, in the United States than in Mexico.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"9069, 6869, 6970, 4444, 4445, 4544, 3803, 3796, 4139, 3819, 3834, 2994, 2832, 2846, 2616, 2403, 2396, 2443, 2415, 2416, 2417, 2418, 2419, 2422, 2311, 2268, 2079, 1810, 1756, 1838, 1750, 1701, 1657, 1630, 1565, 1618, 1422, 1445, 1328, 1304, 1293, 1143, 1128, 1145, 1094, 1084, 1054, 1000, 0992, 0995, 1021, 0974, 0989, 1028, 0998, 0930, 0942, 0686, 0663, 0585, 0565, 0541, 0475, 0423, 0384, 0373, 0347, 0366, 0340, 0337, 0325, 0330, 0320, 0322, 0315, 0293, 0260, 0234, 0227, 0167, 0178, 0152, 0114, 0070, 0089, 0127, 0059","repeated_count":"87","date":"03/31/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
