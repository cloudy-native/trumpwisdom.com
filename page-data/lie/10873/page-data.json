And if you remember, our secretary of state at the time and our President at the time said, 'This will give 250,000 jobs,' and he and she were right, except it was for South Korea, not for us.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to a free-trade agreement with South Korea that was negotiated by the President George W. Bush’s administration and then tweaked by President Barack Obama’s. It’s worth noting that calculating job gains or losses from such agreements is more art than science, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/04/07/public-citizens-misleading-math-on-the-korea-free-trade-agreement/?utm_term=.53a1e30c072d\">as we found in 2015</a>, so Trump’s 100,000 estimate should be taken with a grain of salt. Obama predicted an increase of 70,000 jobs, not 250,000 jobs.
