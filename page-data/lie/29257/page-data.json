I think it's a terrible thing when people or states are allowed to tabulate ballots for a long period of time after the election is over because it can only lead to one thing, and that's very bad. You know what that thing is. I think it's a very dangerous, terrible thing. And I think it's terrible when we can't know the results of an election the night of the election in a modern-day age of computers. I think it's a terrible thing.”","analysis":"Trump has falsely warned of possible fraud by mail-in ballots, hyping local incidents and hitches as part of some vast conspiracy to deny him re-election. There is no legal requirement that mandates the immediate reporting of all election results in the country; delayed counting is unavoidable when so many people are avoiding election lines during the pandemic. Plenty of presidential elections have remained unsettled on election night, some for days or weeks.
