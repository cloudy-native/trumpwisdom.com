The Congressional Research Service says the trade deal had a “modest” effect on the U.S. economy. Trump often says the U.S. has a trade deficit with Mexico of $100 billion, but his number is way off. According to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the U.S. had a trade deficit of $64.1 billion with Mexico in 2017, counting goods and service. The U.S. had an overall trade surplus with Canada of $8.4 billion in 2017. In any case, countries do not lose money on trade.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"31186, 30376, 29782, 30501, 29188, 29337, 29601, 28913, 28986, 28037, 27936, 27836, 26832, 27460, 26487, 26115, 25248, 25896, 25075, 24771, 24852, 24504, 24136, 23410, 22117, 21996, 22047, 22445, 22543, 21301, 21766, 21395, 20805, 20556, 18779, 18614, 18038, 17780, 17382, 16820, 16703, 16193, 15384, 14938, 14816, 15000, 14065, 14596, 14666, 13879, 13696, 12769, 13300, 12625, 13092, 12302, 11627, 12173, 11208, 11059, 10708, 10634, 10857, 10226, 9874, 9816, 9541, 9430, 8963, 8761, 7836, 8160, 8178, 7990, 7564, 7359, 7425, 7440, 6827, 7059, 6646, 6033, 6440, 5997, 6201, 6400, 6174, 6175, 6501, 6115, 5435, 6316, 6084, 5385, 5498, 5792, 5842, 5186, 5194, 5240, 5241, 5782, 5727, 5135, 5658, 5663, 5669, 5638, 4901, 4808, 4812, 4978, 4981, 4996, 5000, 4939, 4941, 4953, 4684, 4693, 4435, 4598, 3986, 3408, 3333, 2680, 2665, 2764, 2746, 2817, 2828, 2694, 2790, 2472, 2482, 2461, 2071, 1892, 1851, 1547, 1575, 1456, 1350, 0964, 0694, 0473, 0432, 0416, 0408, 0262, 0235, 0236, 0150, 0031","repeated_count":"154","date":"08/23/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
