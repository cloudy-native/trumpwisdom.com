The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/530/\">obtained case-by-case records</a> on each of these 44,435 individuals held in ICE custody on June 30, 2019. \"The vast majority (58 percent) of individuals in ICE custody June 30 had no criminal record,\" TRAC said. \"An even larger proportion—four out of five—either had no record, or had only committed a minor offense such as a traffic violation. This left just one out of five who had been convicted of what ICE classified as a felony. Of these only 16 percent were what ICE defines as a serious, or Level 1, offense. Even among Level 1 offenses ICE included crimes such as 'selling marijuana' which many states have now legalized.\" ","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
