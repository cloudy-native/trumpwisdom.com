Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel. He had far worse 'stains' than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!”","analysis":"The late Sen. John McCain learned of the dossier from Christopher Steele, a former British spy, after the 2016 election and referred it to the FBI. The Steele dossier contained information that Russia -- a hostile foreign power -- interfered in the U.S. presidential election. It's a serious situation that all senators, U.S. intelligence agencies and the Department of Justice agreed warranted investigation. Starr in this interview on Fox News <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/16/politics/trump-mccain-starr-dossier/index.html\">also called</a> McCain a \"great man\" and an \"American hero.\" Trump also misrepresents McCain's stance on repealing the Affordable Care Act.

Other Republicans voted against skinny repeal, though Trump always trains his fire on McCain. There was no guarantee that the skinny repeal would have become law since it would have had to go to conference with the House, which had passed a very different bill.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
