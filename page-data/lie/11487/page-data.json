Do you notice? Remember? Remember? I usually save that for November, December, but I was just thinking -- as I mentioned, I was saying, we're going to say, 'Merry Christmas.' They were all taking it down off the department stores -- everything. You'd see a big red -- they'd say, 'Happy Holidays.' No 'Merry Christmas.' They're saying, 'Merry Christmas,' again.”","analysis":"This claim is a strange favorite of the president's. There is no evidence that stores stopped using Merry Christmas in their advertising, were \"ashamed\" to do so or that any of this changed since Trump took office.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
