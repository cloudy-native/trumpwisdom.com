Crooked, a crooked person. 'Did you leak?' Remember Chuck Grassley. 'Did you leak the information to the newspapers?' Uh, uh, he choked when he heard...You know, the guy choked like a dog, Comey. He leaked, he lied, he did a lot of things.”","analysis":"Trump appears to be hyping up -- and inventing -- an exchange at a May 2017 hearing. Comey, who was still the FBI director at the time, actually told Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) he did not leak, or authorize anyone else at the FBI to leak, information about those investigations to the press. About a month later, after Comey was fired by Trump, he said at another hearing that he had a friend of his relay to the New York Times the contents of a memo he wrote about a conversation he had with Trump about Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, whom the FBI was investigating. Comey said he intentionally wrote these notes about this conversation in a way that the information wouldn't be classified. The Justice Department Inspector General found no evidence that Comey leaked classified information to the media. Trump himself revealed these conversations existed in his letter firing Comey. Moreover, the Special Counsel's report found Comey's account to be credible: \"Corney's memory of the details of the dinner, including that the President requested loyalty, has remained consistent throughout.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"30464, 29238, 26243, 26101, 16924","repeated_count":"5","date":"11/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
