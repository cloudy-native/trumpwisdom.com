I use this example, there are many examples, but they shot one person, another person, another person, another person. Hundreds of people dead and horribly wounded to this day. That was five years ago. If there was one gun being carried by one person on the other side, it very well could've been a whole different result. The shooting went on so long and there wasn't a thing you could do about it. 'Get over here.' Boom. \"Get over here.\" Boom. And then they left. They were captured later. There was only one gun. If there were two, three, four, it wouldn't have happened -- a tiny percentage, by comparison.”","analysis":"The November 2015 Paris attacks were a series of coordinated terrorist attacks. The attackers killed 130 people, including 90 at the Bataclan theatre. Another 413 people were injured. Three groups, comprising three men each, executed the attacks, so it's unclear what one person with a gun might have done. When police launched an assault, two attackers at the theater died by detonating their suicide vests.","pinocchios":"","category":"Terrorism","repeated_ids":"10839, 10201, 6438","repeated_count":"3","date":"04/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
