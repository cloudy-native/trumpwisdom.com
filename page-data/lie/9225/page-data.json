But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House & Senate Intelligence & Senator Burr. So bad for our Country!”","analysis":"Judge T.S. Ellis, who presided over one of Manafort’s trials and sentenced him in March, was describing the facts of that case. The judge said that Manafort “is not before the court for anything having to do with colluding with the Russian government to influence this election” and that Manafort “is not before the court for any allegation that he or anybody at his direction colluded with the Russian government to influence the 2016 presidential election.” That’s a simple acknowledgment that Manafort was not tried on charges having to do with collusion in the 2016 election. Ellis was not absolving Trump or his campaign. This Manafort case centered on financial fraud, not allegations of colluding with Russians. Kevin Downing, an attorney for Manafort, told reporters outside the courthouse after his client was sentenced that “there is absolutely no evidence Paul Manafort worked in collusion with any government official from Russia.” Again, this is a statement about Manafort in particular, not the Trump campaign in general, as the president’s comments suggest.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
