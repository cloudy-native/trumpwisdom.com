The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!”","analysis":"Under fire for a sluggish response, Trump started to target the Obama administration, especially its handling of the 2009 swine flu outbreak. On April 26, 2009, when only 20 cases of H1N1 — and no deaths — around the country had been confirmed, the Obama administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency. A million people were tested in the month after the first confirmed case. The administration quickly sought funding from Congress, receiving almost $8 billion. Six weeks later, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. On Oct. 24, after more than 1,000 Americans had died of H1N1, Obama declared a national emergency. The estimated death toll in the United States during the H1N1 epidemic was 12,469 from April 2009 to April 2010, but that was much less than a forecast of 30,000 to 90,000 deaths made in August of 2009 by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. Trump also claimed to have a 78 percent approval rating, \"the highest on record.\" We couldn't find any poll with those numbers.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
