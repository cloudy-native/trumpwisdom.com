It stopped. That was two months ago. It totally stopped.”","analysis":"Trump frequently suggests he passed a new law but he signed no such bill. The Veterans’ Memorial Preservation and Recognition Act of 2003, which sought to thwart vandalizing public monuments, was signed by George W. Bush. Trump merely issued an executive order calling attention to Bush's law and enacted no new law. The executive order was narrow and did not create any new penalties. Trump repeatedly said people arrested for vandalism during protests over the police killing of George Floyd would face \"automatic\" 10-year sentences, but neither state nor federal authorities sought such punishment. Trump frequently claims statues no longer came down after he signed the order but that's not true.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"31298, 30932, 30350, 30163, 30269, 28936, 29108, 28184, 27593, 27827, 27245, 27371, 25131, 24820, 24544, 24345, 23610, 23425, 23250, 23206, 23103, 23110, 22120, 22010, 22385, 21003, 22527, 22999, 22918, 22970, 22142, 22168, 22806, 22820, 21825, 21274, 22671, 21654, 21126, 21137, 20863, 20888, 20750, 20616, 20648, 20583, 20609, 20466, 20474, 20547, 20403","repeated_count":"51","date":"08/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
