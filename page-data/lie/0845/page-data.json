Comey and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Comey testified to Congress that Trump asked everyone (including Sessions ) to leave the room after a group meeting in February 2017, before Trump talked to Comey about the FBI's investigation of fired National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Trump denies asking others to leave the room. But in his Senate testimony, Sessions did not deny this detail, and instead said that Comey expressed \"concern\" to Sessions about being left alone with the president.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/19/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
