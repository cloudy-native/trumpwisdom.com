She has been so extraordinary, in terms of her advocacy for America's working families. Fourteen million people she's gotten jobs for, where she would go into Walmart, she would go into our great companies and say, 'They really want help. They really want you to teach them.' Because the government can't teach like the companies can teach. And companies would take a half a million people, a million people. And her goal when she started it two years ago was 500,000 jobs; she's done over 14 million. So that's really something.”","analysis":"Trump rarely credits anyone other than himself, but he routinely celebrates his daughter Ivanka’s creation of millions of jobs. By January 2020, Trump bragged she had created 15 million jobs. That’s a neat trick, since official government statistics show the economy has gained fewer than 7 million jobs in the first three years of Trump’s presidency. So what is Trump talking about? His daughter co-chairs a workforce policy advisory board that encourages companies to pledge training opportunities to workers over the next five years. That right -- “training opportunities.” It turned out that many of these companies and organizations were already planning to offer such retraining programs, but as part of a publicity effort the White House got them to sign a public pledge. Ivanka Trump can certainly be congratulated for getting so many companies to put their names in writing and pledge to train workers. Yet these are not new jobs, but training opportunities. Moreover, the numbers reflect pledges over a five-year period, not something already achieved, as the president consistently frames it.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"21954, 19271, 19085, 18467, 18033, 17016, 18436, 17206, 17274, 16901, 16870, 18203, 18177, 16530, 16475, 16220, 15700, 14577, 12861, 11984, 11918, 11795, 11138, 9837, 9181, 8958","repeated_count":"26","date":"12/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
