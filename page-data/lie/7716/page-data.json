We don't want to be taken advantage anymore by countries that use us and use our incredible military to protect them. They don't pay for it, and they're going to have to. We're going to use our heads, and wealthy countries cannot continue to use the United States to defend them.”","analysis":"The Pentagon spends an estimated $10 billion a year on overseas bases. More than 70 percent of the total is spent in Japan, Germany and South Korea, where most U.S. troops abroad are permanently stationed. The U.S. receives various forms of compensation from the host countries, from rent-free real estate where the bases are located to actual cash payments meant to offset U.S. costs. Japan, for instance, pays about $2 billion a year. While not all of the money is fully reimbursed, U.S. security is enhanced by the forward deployment of U.S. forces.
