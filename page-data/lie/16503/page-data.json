We’re going to be expanding the length. You have a lot of natural where you have 1,978 miles. You need 500 miles, but 700 would be good, 750 or so would be great. We're going to now get it up.

The 100 miles he's talking about are all replacement fencing -- none of it went up in areas that did not previously have barriers. And Trump has downshifted his ambitions and is now building a system of see-through, bollard-style fences -- which can be cut through with a modified power saw.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
