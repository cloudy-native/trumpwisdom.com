And we're taking them out of our country by the thousands -- out, out by the thousands.”","analysis":"It's absurd to claim House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi \"loves MS-13.\" Trump's \"animals\" comment at first was misreported by various news organizations as applying to all undocumented immigrants, when in fact Trump was answering a question only about MS-13 gang members. Pelosi did not mention MS-13 while responding to Trump's \"animals\" comment. She approached the issue more gingerly, saying \"calling people animals is not a good thing.\" Responding to the misreported comments from Trump, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/24/donald-trump/donald-trumps-false-claim-nancy-pelosi-came-out-fa/\">Pelosi said</a>, \"When the president of the United States says about undocumented immigrants, ‘These aren't people. These are animals,’ you have to wonder, does he not believe in the spark of divinity, the dignity and worth of every person?\" She was not defending MS-13.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/29/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
