And I'm in such a horrible position because in one way I have to negotiate, in the other way, I love. Mr. and Mrs. Warmbier and I love Otto and it's a very, very delicate balance. He was a special young man. And to see what happened was so bad, was so bad. And a lot of what I do with respect to North Korea and any success that we hopefully have and we've had a lot given no credit.”","analysis":"Trump is alluding to criticism he received from the parents of Otto Warmbier, an American who died after being captured and abused by North Korea. The Warmbiers didn't criticize Trump for negotiating with North Korea; they criticized Trump for saying he believed Kim Jong Un when he claimed no role in Warmbier's death or mistreatment.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
