The United States made more substantial commitments under the Paris Accord — which the Trump administration is abandoning — because the United States, on a per capita basis, is a much bigger polluter than either country. On a per capita basis, the United States in 2015 produced more than double the carbon dioxide emissions of China — and eight times more than India. China, in its submission to the Paris accord, said that, compared to 2005 levels, it would seek to cut its carbon emissions by 60 to 65 percent per unit of GDP by 2030. India said it would reduce its emissions per unit of economic output by 33 to 35 percent below 2005 by 2030. Note that both countries pledge to reach these goals by 2030, meaning they are taking steps now to meet their commitments. India, for instance, seeks to have renewable power make up 40 percent of its power base by 2030, so it is investing heavily in solar energy. The country is now on track to become the world’s third-largest solar power market in 2018, after China and the United States. China is also investing heavily in renewable energy.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
