And they got caught. And what they did was treason. What they did was terrible. What they did was against our Constitution and everything we stand for.”","analysis":"Trump falsely claims that the Russia investigation had an \"illegal\" origin. But his own appointee, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, authorized the special counsel investigation and selected Robert Mueller to lead it. Multiple judges upheld Mueller's appointment. Trump calls it a witch hunt, but Mueller indicted numerous individuals, including Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort. Trump calls it \"treason,\" a crime punishable by death, but it's an unfounded claim.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
