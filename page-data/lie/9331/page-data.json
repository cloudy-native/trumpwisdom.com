This is the info that got us the Witch Hunt!”","analysis":"Trump is referring to testimony by Steele, the former British spy who authored the dossier, that he tried to verify some information he had received with an article on an internet site called CNN iReport, a user-generated citizen journalism initiative started by CNN that has been ended. He said thought the information on the site had \"some kind of CNN status\" but did not realize it was not connected to CNN reporters. But Trump errs in stating that the Russia investigation -- \"witch hunt\" -- stems from the Steele dossier. The FBI counterintelligence investigation was prompted by a tip from the Australian government, which notified U.S. authorities about a conversation over drinks between a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, and an Australian diplomat in May. Papadopoulos claimed the Russians had “political dirt” on Clinton. The memo released by the Republican majority of the House Intelligence Committee, which Trump has approvingly cited, confirms the counterintelligence investigation of Russian interference  began in July 2016, because of the tip about Papadopoulos. The information in the dossier came to the attention of the FBI later.
