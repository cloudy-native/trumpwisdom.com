Trump is blaming the coronavirus pandemic for the failure of what almost every analyst says was a flawed trade deal from the start. Before the coronavirus pandemic began, many analysts and trade-watchers doubted that China would be able to purchase an added $200 billion of goods from the United States over two years, as stipulated in Trump's \"phase one\" trade deal. “Under perfect health, economic, and political conditions, China might have reached its 2020 purchase commitments,” Derek Scissors, a China trade expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told us..“But even without the pandemic, ideal economic and political conditions were unrealistic from the start. The Trump administration knew when signing the deal that it was going to act against Chinese technology firms and should have expected China to game the purchases — for example what country’s oil and gas to buy — because that’s what always happens.”","pinocchios":"3","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
