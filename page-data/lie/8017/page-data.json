It's a big hoax, and it's very bad for our country. So what happened with the FBI -- I have done a great service for our country when I fired James Comey because he was a bad cop, and he was a dirty cop, and he lied.”","analysis":"There's no evidence that the special counsel investigation is a witch hunt or a hoax. In fact, the special counsel has revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The investigation into potential collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign continues, and no conclusions have been announced. Meanwhile, It's not clear which lies Trump is referring to here. Previously he has speculated that Comey lied to Senator Grassley about a disclosure made to the Wall Street Journal in 2016. But a new Inspector General report says Comey likely didn't know. If he's referring to the memos that Comey had passed on to a reporter after he was fired, that information was not classified.
