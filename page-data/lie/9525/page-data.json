You don't get to use it unless a really great tragedy hits and then you don't really want it because you don't give a damn about your deductible, right?”","analysis":"Deductibles vary according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/fact-sheet/cost-sharing-for-plans-offered-in-the-federal-marketplace-for-2019/\">the type of plan that people buy</a>. Trump appears to be referring to \"Bronze plan\" deductibles, which are $6,258 when prescription drugs and medical spending are in the deductible; the deductibles for Silver, Gold and Platinum plans are much lower. Silver plans are the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/silver-health-plan/\">most common choice</a> in the marketplace and have equivalent deductibles of $4,375. The Affordable Care Act included subsidies that helped keep premiums low for most people on the exchanges. Trump eliminated cost-sharing reduction payments which compensate insurance companies for offering mandatory discounts on out-of-pocket spending to lower-income customers. Ironically, that led to even bigger premium subsidies as companies hiked premiums to make up for the loss of income.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"9974, 9653, 9718, 9626, 9610, 9476, 9525, 9492","repeated_count":"8","date":"03/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
