But, believe it or not, lately I've been getting lots of GREAT books!”","analysis":"Trump is speaking about \"Rage,\" a book by Bob Woodward that portrays the Trump presidency as coming off the rails, and a sequel of sorts to Woodward's previous book about Trump, \"Fear,\" which the president also criticized..Woodward relied on sources who in many cases were not identified, as is his long-standing practice. Woodward says he has hundreds of hours of taped interviews with sources who have direct knowledge of the events described in the book. Reporting by major media outlets about the inner workings of the Trump administration in many cases corroborates Woodward's reporting in \"Fear\" and \"Rage.\" An associate editor of The Post renowned for his Watergate reporting, Woodward has written about the inner workings of both Democratic and Republican administrations since the 1970s. The accuracy of scenes and facts in the books have not been credibly challenged.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
