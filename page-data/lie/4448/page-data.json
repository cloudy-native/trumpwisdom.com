And then the highway was no good and it would end up costing like 25 times more than they originally thought. We've got it down to about two years and what I want to do is get it down to one year.”","analysis":"This is a wide exaggeration. According to our friends at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/does-it-take-10-years-get-permit-build-road-donald/\">Politifact</a>, recent government studies say the permit approval time ranges from 4.6 to 6.6 years. The only study that claims a 10-year approval is common comes from a pro-deregulation group, which raises questions about its reliability. This still falls short of Trump's 21 year claim.
