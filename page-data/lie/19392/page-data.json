Chinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world when the virus was first discovered by Chinese authorities.”","analysis":"Trump puts the worst possible spin on this series of events. “Human influenza caused by a new subtype” is always supposed to be reported to the WHO within 24 hours. It was action from the WHO forced China’s hand. “WHO headquarters in Geneva first learned about the outbreak in Wuhan not directly from Chinese authorities, but rather from the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), a U.S.-based open-source platform for early intelligence about infectious disease outbreaks,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46354#page=12\">according to a comprehensive timeline issued by the Congressional Research Service</a>. Headquarters then “asked the WHO China Country Office to request ‘verification of the event’ from the government of China.” WHO acted under regulations that it “take into account reports from sources other than notifications or consultations” by countries. CRS noted “it appears China may not have proactively notified WHO of the outbreak.” There is evidence Chinese officials were slow to act in response to reports from medical professionals starting in mid-December about a strange new disease. “A bureaucratic culture that prioritizes political stability over all else probably allowed the virus to spread farther and faster,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/02/01/early-missteps-state-secrecy-china-likely-allowed-coronavirus-spread-farther-faster/\">The Washington Post reported on Feb. 1</a>. As for the pressure to mislead, Trump appears to be referring to questions about whether there was human-to-human transmission of the virus. The WHO said there was \"no clear evidence\" but refused to rule it out. Indeed, a top WHO official said human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given the WHO’s experience with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and other respiratory pathogens. During the first weeks of outbreak, Trump repeatedly praised China's handling of the outbreak, even in the face of news reports that raised questions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
