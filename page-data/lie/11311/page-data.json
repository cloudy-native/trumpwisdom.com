Trump has claimed the census would be “meaningless” without this “all-important question.” But numerous experts — including those in the Census Bureau — say that adding a citizenship question would depress response rates by intimidating immigrants fearing potential deportation. (The census is supposed to count all residents, not just citizens.) A separate survey which is taken every year — the American Community Survey — asks about citizenship, but citizenship hasn't been asked for all U.S. households since the 1950 census.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
