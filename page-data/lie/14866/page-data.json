You know, you have two elections. You have Electoral College, you have popularity. I like to go for the Electoral College. By the way, for me to win the popular vote would be much easier than -- the Electoral College is much harder to win. Much harder.”","analysis":"Trump earned 306 pledged electors, Clinton 232. (Trump often reverses the last two digits to say Clinton only got 223.) Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million. If 40,000 votes had switched in three states, Trump would have also lost the Electoral College. So it was no landslide, as Trump often claims. Democrats obviously do not have an Electoral College lock. According to a tally by John Pitney of Claremont McKenna College, every Republican president since Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 won a larger share of the electoral college votes than Trump, with the exception of George W. Bush (twice) and Nixon in 1968.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"21268, 16456, 14769, 14866, 14715, 11274, 9314, 8142, 8091, 6878, 5941, 5956, 5591, 5111, 4888, 4310, 3866, 3786, 3043, 2941, 2771, 2513, 2426, 2081, 2110, 1550, 1417, 1199, 0886, 0639, 0560, 0397","repeated_count":"32","date":"11/22/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
