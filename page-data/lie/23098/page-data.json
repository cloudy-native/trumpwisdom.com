Looters -- they got them out of jail. And his running mate, Kamala, urged their supporters to do the same thing. It's outrageous that they're now seeking to shift the blame for the mayhem.”","analysis":"We <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/09/03/kamala-harris-tweeted-support-bail-fund-money-didnt-just-assist-protestors/\">looked into this</a> and it turned out The Minnesota Freedom Fund was only a bit player in the release of people charged during the protests. The vast majority of people — 92 percent — had to pay no bail. So Trump is wrong to suggest that the donations by either Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) or Biden campaign staff led to the release of many protesters or rioters.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"28943, 28826, 26645, 27080, 27253, 25875, 24845, 24627, 24399, 23098, 22404, 22994","repeated_count":"12","date":"08/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
