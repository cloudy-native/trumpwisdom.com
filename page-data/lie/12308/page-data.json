You ever hear the word? Nobody ever heard of it before. They went back. Now, nobody looks at Obama getting $60 million for a book. That's okay. Even though nobody in history ever got that money for a book. Obama got $60 million. Think of it: $60 million for a book.”","analysis":"Barack Obama and Michelle Obama received $65 million for a joint deal for a book by each of them, so Obama is not getting \"$60 million for a book.\" Moreover, the Obama deal was reached after he left office. The Constitution's emoluments clause is about payments from foreign governments to current officeholders.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/13/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
