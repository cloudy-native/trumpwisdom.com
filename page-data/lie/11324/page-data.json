There were no mats or pillows for those who found the space to rest. A stench from body odor hung stale in the air. When reporters toured the facility before Pence, the men screamed that they’d been held there 40 days, some longer. They said they were hungry and wanted to brush their teeth. It was sweltering hot, but the only water was outside the fences and they needed to ask permission from the Border Patrol agents to drink.\" Pence only stayed in the facility for a few minutes.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/14/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
