But I think when you have a census, and you're not allowed to talk about whether or not somebody is a citizen or not, that doesn't sound so good to me. Can you imagine, you send out a census and you're not allowed to say whether or not a person is an American citizen?”","analysis":"The Census Bureau’s experts found that adding the citizenship question would reduce the response rate among households with at least one noncitizen by eight percentage points. Although census responses are confidential under federal law and cannot be used to assist immigration sweeps or deportations, some noncitizens may assume otherwise and refuse to answer. Moreover, the Census Bureau already asks 3.5 million households a year about their citizenship status. Since 2005, the American Community Survey, a long-form questionnaire that census officials send to less than 3 percent of households, has included a citizenship question. ACS data is used widely across the government, including to distribute $675 billion a year in state and federal funds, according to the Census Bureau.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
