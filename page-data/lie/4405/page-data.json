Previously he has speculated that Comey lied to Senator Grassley about a disclosure made to the Wall Street Journal in 2016. But a new Inspector General report says Comey likely didn't know. If he's referring to the memos that Comey had passed on to a reporter after he was fired, that information was not classified.
