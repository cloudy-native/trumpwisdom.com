This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the \"SACRED\" vote counting rooms!”","analysis":"Here, Trump is citing a report from Just the News, a right-leaning website, which claims that mail-in ballots were rejected at rate 30 times lower in this election compared with previous years. The report did not mention that there was a major public education campaign this cycle to help voters understand how to comply with mail-in ballot rules, given that so many people were mailing ballots because of the pandemic. The report claimed that 28,000 people might have had their ballots rejected under the ordinary ratio of rejected ballots, compared with nearly 1,000 people in 2020. We are not going to bother to check whether the math is right. That’s because at the time of this tweet, Biden was leading Trump by more than 68,000 votes in Pennsylvania. In other words, even if all these ballots had been rejected (and they were all for Biden), it would have made no difference in the outcome. (Also, no evidence has emerged that GOP poll watchers were not able to observe the counting of ballots.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/16/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
