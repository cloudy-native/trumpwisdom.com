Now Democrats want to steal trillions of dollars from Medicare.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to a claim made by Republicans that Obama took $700 billion from Medicare to fund the Affordable care Act. The savings mostly were wrung from health-care providers, not Medicare beneficiaries — who, as a result of the health-care law, ended up with new benefits for preventive care and prescription drugs. The Obama health-care law also raised Medicare payroll taxes by $318 billion over the 10-year time frame, further strengthening the program’s financial condition. Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration in their budget plans have pocketed virtually all of those savings — and sought even more reductions in Medicare spending on top of that.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
