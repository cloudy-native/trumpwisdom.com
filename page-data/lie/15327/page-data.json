Bill Clinton has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/13/how-trump-compares-with-other-recent-presidents-in-appointing-federal-judges/\">the record</a>, with 367 judicial appointments in his two terms, followed by Ronald Reagan with 358 and then George W. Bush with 322. Through his four years, 226 judges nominated by Trump were confirmed by the Senate. (That is still behind Jimmy Carter, who had 261 judges confirmed in his single term.) George Washington appointed 39 judges during his presidency. Trump appointed 54 judges to the federal appeals court, behind Carter's 59 appeals-court appointments. Trump ranks second, after Carter, in terms of the number of district judges. (He just edged out Clinton and George W. Bush.) Trump often said he would appoint nearly 300 judges but he ended up well short of that number.
