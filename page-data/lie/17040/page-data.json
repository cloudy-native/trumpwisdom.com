Rosie O'Donnell, who violated the campaign finance laws as badly as anybody I've ever seen, and nothing happens to her, right? And yet, Dinesh by violate that he made a little mistake and they want to destroy him. So we pardoned him. By the way he made a mistake. Rosie O'Donnell, that was a massive violation of the campaign finance laws, but Dinesh, Dinesh D'Souza, they wanted to put him in jail. I don't know, I think he might have even gone to jail for a period of time for doing something that was really very understandable. Rosie O'Donnell, five times, what she did is incredible, nothing happens, and then she gets on and says what a bad guy I am.”","analysis":"This is a claim that's popular in right-wing circles. But it doesn't hold water. Individuals are limited in the amount of money they can donate to candidates. Souza willfully violated campaign laws by directing people to make campaign contributions under their own names and then reimbursing them. He was convicted of a felony. O'Donnell surpassed the limit when donating to five different campaigns under her own name, but her errors were not considered willful and so she was never charged.
