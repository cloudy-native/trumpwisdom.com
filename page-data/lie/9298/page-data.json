I thank all of the Strong Republicans who voted to support Border Security and our desperately needed WALL!”","analysis":"Trump calls it a \"Democrat inspired Resolution,\" but it had bipartisan support -- 12 GOP votes in the Senate, and 13 in the House. It was not an \"open borders\" resolution; it disapproved of Trump's decision to declare a national emergency as a means of funding his promised border wall. Congress has constitutional authority to approve or reject spending decisions and has refused to approve wall funding. Trump's emergency declaration is seen by many lawmakers as an effort to circumvent that authority. Trump routinely argues that immigrants bring more crime, but researchers have found continually that legal and unauthorized immigrants commit crime at lower rates than the native-born population. Most heroin smuggled through the border is taken through legal ports of entry, which would continue to exist if a wall were built. It's also well known that drug cartels and others dig tunnels into the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/14/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
