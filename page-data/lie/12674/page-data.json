A lot of illegal voting.”","analysis":"Trump, apparently still annoyed he lost the popular vote in the 2016 election, makes a baseless claim that undocumented immigrants are illegally voting in so-called sanctuary cities. (He has tried to explain away his loss by claiming without evidence that there were millions of illegal votes cast.)
