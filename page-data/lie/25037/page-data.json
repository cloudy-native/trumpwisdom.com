Okay, that's over a course of 16 years, close to 3,000, right? In three years and including energy, because look at the saving, how are you doing at the gas pump? Not so bad, right? Did you ever see that? Did you ever think that was going to happen? In three years, so that was less than 3,000 over 16, in three years, you went up $10,000, including energy.”","analysis":"Trump is adding together a bunch of dubious assumptions, in particular claims of regulatory savings for Americans. We've <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/15/trumps-claim-his-deregulatory-moves-are-saving-american-households-year/\">previously fact-checked</a> Trump's claim of giving households $3,000 a year in regulatory savings. By itself, it's a Three-Pinocchio claim. This is derived from a White House estimate that after five to 10 years, the administration's freeze on new regulations and rollback of Obama-era regulations will raise real incomes by $3,100 per household per year. The estimate depends on a lot of assumptions and some cherry-picking but a bigger problem is that Trump speaks as if this pile of money is already landing in a household's pocket. The president never mentions actions taken by the administration that have reduced household income. For instance, Federal Reserve Bank of New York officials <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/new-china-tariffs-increase-costs-to-us-households.html?mod=article_inlin\">peg</a> Trump's tariffs as already costing the typical U.S. household $831 a year. He frequently makes a comparison to numbers under George W. Bush and Barack Obama but those are apples-and-oranges comparisons.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"28798, 28980, 26439, 26247, 26167, 25851, 25037, 24606, 21999, 22928, 22187, 22832, 18464, 18070, 17029, 17501, 18257, 18286, 16834, 18195, 16743, 16715, 16532, 16113, 16183, 16325, 15426, 14935, 15713, 15746, 14563, 15847","repeated_count":"32","date":"09/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
