I don’t believe there was one or two people. Nine people…. They make up sources.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to a Washington Post article that disclosed that then-National security adviser Michael Flynn privately discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with that country’s ambassador to the United States during the month before President Trump took office, contrary to public assertions by Trump officials. That article prompted a firestorm that led to Flynn’s firing by Trump, because it turned out that Flynn had misled Vice President Pence and other administration officials about whether he had discussed sanctions.\n\nThe article cited information provided by “nine current and former officials, who were in senior positions at multiple agencies at the time of the calls.” (Calls by the Russian ambassador are monitored by intelligence agencies.) No White House official has disputed the accuracy of the article – and indeed, it resulted in Flynn’s departure from the administration.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/24/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
