With today's executive order, which eliminates long-standing obstacles to data sharing, we're aiming to count everyone. Ultimately, this will allow us to have an even more complete count of citizens than through asking the single question alone. It will be, we think, far more accurate.”","analysis":"This is a contradiction. The Census Bureau had said all along that cross-referencing records would generate the most accurate data on citizenship. But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross overruled the experts, finding that the records alone would give an “incomplete picture,” and that's why he ordered that a citizenship question be added to the Census form. After losing a legal challenge at the Supreme Court, Trump said not having the question and cross-referencing records would be more accurate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
