You look at San Antonio, you look at so many different places. They go from one of the most unsafe cities in the country to one of the safest cities immediately, immediately. It works, we have to put them up, and we will put them up.”","analysis":"We presume Trump misspoke when he said San Antonio, which is 150 miles north of the border. A White House source told CNN he meant to say San Diego. But southwest border apprehensions are down everywhere along the border — in sectors with barriers or fencing, and in sectors without them. From 2000 to 2017, southwest border apprehensions declined 81.5 percent overall. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the San Diego fence, by itself, “did not have a discernible impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens coming across the border.” For several days before this comment, Trump had made misleading references to crime declining in El Paso. That city had the third lowest violent crime rate among 35 U.S. cities with a population over 500,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 – before construction of a 57-mile-long fence started in mid-2008.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
