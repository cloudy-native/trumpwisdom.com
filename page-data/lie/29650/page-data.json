They will NEVER like him, or vote for him. They are voting for 'TRUMP.'”","analysis":"Trump keeps mixing up his opponents. Hillary Clinton, not Joe Biden, used the term “super predator.” And she only used it once, though Trump claims Biden said it repeatedly. The “super predators” line comes from a 1996 speech in New Hampshire, where Clinton spoke in support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which her husband, Bill Clinton, had signed into law. “But we also have to have an organized effort against gangs,” Hillary Clinton <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0uCrA7ePno\">said</a>. “Just as in a previous generation, we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels. They are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators — no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"29831, 29917, 30217, 30293, 30324, 30526, 29302, 29634, 29650, 29652, 29702, 29950, 30130, 28714, 28915, 29152, 26935, 25372, 26026, 23121","repeated_count":"20","date":"11/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
