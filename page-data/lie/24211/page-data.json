They talked about don't wear masks, and now they say wear masks. Although some people say don't wear masks. I mean you have a lot of different ideas.”","analysis":"Trump has three basic complaints about Anthony S. Fauci, the renowned director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But they are bogus. 1) Fauci never said anything like “This will pass.” He spoke as a scientist, evaluating the data in front of him. From the start, he warned of the need to be vigilant. 2) While Fauci did initially express public skepticism about the effectiveness of travel restrictions, by the time of the announcement, Fauci was a supporter of the idea. “These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS,” Health Secretary Alex Azar said shortly after the announcement. 3) As for wearing a mask, Fauci has explained he was motivated by early fears that N95 masks needed by hospital workers would quickly run out of stock. Once science indicated that the virus was spread by people who were asymptomatic, the guidance was updated, because even fabric masks can help halt the spread if everyone wears them.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"29424, 30071, 26942, 27030, 26747, 26718, 26900, 27256, 27399, 26375, 26180, 26307, 26023, 24880, 24801, 24556, 24333, 24211, 23333, 23495, 23130, 23017, 21286, 21716, 20834, 21613, 21082, 21160, 21163, 20870","repeated_count":"30","date":"09/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
