It's everything that you can imagine. It's hard to believe in this country that we would have had that. I don't know if you remember a long time ago, very early on, I used the word ‘wiretap’ and I put it in quotes, meaning surveillance, spying, you can sort of say whatever if you want.”","analysis":"As for the spying that Trump mentions, it has been reported that an FBI informant in Europe, a professor named Stefan Halper, met with at least three people working on the Trump campaign in Europe. So far, there has been nothing to indicate whether there was a political agenda or a “spy” mandate as part of Halper's assistance for the FBI, which started after the agency opened a counterintelligence probe. The FISA surveillance warrant on Carter Page, a one time campaign aide to Trump, was issued after Page had left the campaign.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"23036, 22981, 22945, 22960, 22904, 22905, 22873, 22874, 22664, 22634, 22645, 22630, 19785, 19738, 19705, 19671, 19649, 19485, 19445, 17555, 17519, 17196, 16796, 16298, 15906, 15996, 15925, 15394, 14745, 13854, 15486, 12653, 11410, 12040, 11451, 11891, 11265, 11870, 11180, 11773, 11744, 11106, 11080, 10651, 10950, 10763, 10574, 10134, 10135, 10145, 10153, 10077, 9973, 9843, 8054, 5013, 4770, 3314, 3255, 3240, 3256, 3155, 3157, 3178, 3231, 3239, 3143, 3210","repeated_count":"68","date":"04/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
