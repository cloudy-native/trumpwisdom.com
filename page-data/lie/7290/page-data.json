And I said, \"That sounds like a lot for a one-story building.\" But it was truly $1 billion, it was in excess of $1 billion. I was supposed to sign it. They were going to start looking for land and everything. And I called David Friedman, the great ambassador. And I said, \"David, they want me to spend $1 billion on an embassy and it's going to take forever.\" It would have taken forever. And he said, \"You know what? We have a building that we already own that's the best location in Jerusalem, that's set back in terms of safety, and I think we could renovate it. Could I call you back?\" I said, \"Call me back.\" And he called me back about a week later, and he said, \"Sir, I think we can do it for $180,000.\" I said, \"David,\" -- first time I've ever said this in my entire life -- I said, \"David, that's too cheap. It doesn't sound right.\" \"You've got to spend more. How about $4- or $500,000?\" And we ended up spending about $400,000.”","analysis":"The new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem. Costs for the permanent embassy could well surpass $400,000 when all is said and done.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"12/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
