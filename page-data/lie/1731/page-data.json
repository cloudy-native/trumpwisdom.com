The Truman Library says it has been unable to find any documents that would connect Truman to the tradition of pardoning a turkey. The only record is a turkey provided to the First Family in 1947 for Christmas, not Thanksgiving, by the National Turkey Federation. The first announced \"pardon\" of a turkey took place under George H.W. Bush in 1989, so the tradition only extends for 28 years.
