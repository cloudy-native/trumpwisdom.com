Not the best look -- not the best reputation in the world. I hear they paid him [Hunter Biden] 183,000 a month. Listen to this. 183 and they gave him a three million dollar upfront payment.”","analysis":"Joe Biden's son Hunter earned a substantial sum of money as a board member of Ukraine's Burisma, variously described as either <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hunter-bidens-family-name-aided-deals-with-foreign-tycoons-11608682462\">$50,000 a month</a> or <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-paid-80g-per-month-while-on-board-of-ukranian-gas-company-report\">$83,333 a month</a>. Trump used both figures in the past but somehow, especially in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, he started to say Hunter Biden earned $183,000 a month. There is no evidence that is true, so we will assume this is typical Trumpian exaggeration. He also often claims Hunter Biden received a $3 million up-front payment but has offered no evidence to back that up. (Any offspring of a prominent politician needs to be wary of even the appearance of a conflict of interest between the child's business interests and the parent's political position, so we are not excusing Hunter Biden's poor judgement in accepting this position.)
