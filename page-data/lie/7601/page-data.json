It's going on right now with General Flynn. The FBI said he didn't lie. But Mueller said he did lie, so they took a man who's a general and a respected person and a nice man -- and I don't even know what he said about me, because maybe they scared him enough that he'll make up a story, but I have a feeling that maybe he's a tougher kind of guy than Cohen, but they took a general that they said didn't lie and they convinced him he did lie and he made some kind of a deal.”","analysis":"Trump keeps saying that because FBI agents did not think Flynn indicated he was lying when they asked him about his contacts with a Russian official, that meant he was not lying. But it was only a matter of perception. They did not think he showed signs of being a liar. But he did lie, as shown by monitoring of his conversations with the official and his own admission in court that he lied.
