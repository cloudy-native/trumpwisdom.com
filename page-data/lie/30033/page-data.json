A routine trade deal. When I heard about it,I said 'Wait a minute, they've been killing each other for decades.' They have been killing and killing for decades, each other. Fighting all the time. We're doing a trade deal they wanted, they always want us, all of them want us, the whole world wants us...Then all of a sudden, they were hugging in the oval office. It's great, right. ”","analysis":"Trump falsely-- and bizarrely -- takes credit for ending a war between Serbia and Kosovo that ended more than two decades ago. Despite continued tensions, the two sides have not directly fought each other since 1999. Trump helped negotiate an economic normalization deal between Kosovo and Serbia, but that agreement mostly involved economic and transportation links, and it did not solve tougher geopolitical issues like Serbia’s refusal to recognize Kosovo ever since the country declared its independence in 2008.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30386, 30272, 29720, 30033, 28579, 28391, 27963, 28257","repeated_count":"8","date":"10/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
