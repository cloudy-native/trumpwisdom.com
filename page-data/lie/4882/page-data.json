In 2017, the United States and three other countries met that standard, and Poland spent virtually 2 percent. NATO allies have been steadily boosting defense spending since 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea. In any case, these funds would not be going to the United States or even necessarily to NATO; this is money that countries would spend to bolster their own military.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
