Congress has constitutional authority to approve or reject spending decisions and has refused to approve wall funding. Trump's emergency declaration is seen by many lawmakers as an effort to circumvent that authority. Trump routinely argues that immigrants bring more crime, but researchers have found continually that legal and unauthorized immigrants commit crime at lower rates than the native-born population.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/14/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
