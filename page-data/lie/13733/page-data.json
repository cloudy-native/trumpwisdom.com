They took away our light bulb. I want an incandescent light. I want to look better. Ok, I want to pay less money to look better. Does that make sense? You pay much less money and you look much better and on top of that, with the new bulbs, if they break it's considered a hazardous waste site, it's all gases inside and you're supposed to bring it back to where you bought it in a sealed container, give me a break.”","analysis":"Trump is trying to justify the weakening of rules to promote the extension of light bulb energy-efficiency standards. He appears to be talking about compact fluorescent, or CFL, bulbs, which contain mercury and tend to have harsher color quality. But he's out of date. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nema.org/Intelligence/Indices/Pages/LED-A-line-Halogen-and-CFL-Lamp-Shipments-Decrease-in-First-Quarter-2019-Compared-to-First-Quarter-2018.aspx\">says</a> that in 2019 CFLs accounted for less than 5 percent of all sales of the classic pear-shaped bulbs. Light-emitting diode, or LED, bulbs are the dominant environmentally friendly technology. They don't have safety risks and often provide comparable light at a cheaper lifetime cost than incandescents. LEDs currently made up more than 70 percent of sales.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"21307, 21182, 16330, 13543, 13733, 12758, 12708","repeated_count":"7","date":"09/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
