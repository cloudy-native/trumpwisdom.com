Trump was late to accepting the idea that the economy should be shut down to prevent the spread of the pandemic. He continued to hold campaign rallies until early March and his time on the virus did not change until mid-March. A Columbia University study <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.15.20103655v2\">estimated</a> that tens of thousands fewer people would have died of covid-19 if social-distancing measures had been put in place earlier than mid-March. Specifically, the study estimated that orders in effect March 8 would have resulted in nearly 36,000 fewer deaths (through May 3), and orders as soon as March 1 would have resulted in nearly 54,000 fewer deaths.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
