I called up a real pollster. I said what is that? Sir, that's called a suppression poll. I think you're going to win Wisconsin, sir. I said but why don't they make it four or five points? Because then people vote. But when you're down 17, they say, hey, I'm not going to waste my time. I love the president, but there's no way. Despite that -- despite that, we won Wisconsin. It's going to see -- I mean, you'll see. But that's called suppression because a lot of people when they see that -- it's very interesting, this pollster said, sir, if you're down three, four, or five, people vote. When you go down 17, they say let's save -- let's go and have dinner and let's watch the presidential defeat tonight on television, darling.”","analysis":"News and polling organizations do not publish fake polls or “suppression polls,” which in Trump’s parlance are polls that relay false information to demoralize and dissuade people from voting.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31336, 30926, 30578, 30422, 30332, 30448, 29561, 29738, 30017, 28919, 28476, 28721, 28046, 28140, 28280, 27881, 25738, 25637, 25219, 24706, 24533, 24387, 23942, 22651, 22636","repeated_count":"25","date":"01/06/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
