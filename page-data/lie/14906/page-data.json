The server (there’s more than one) is not in Ukraine; it’s in Washington, displayed at the DNC’s offices beside a filing cabinet the Watergate burglars pried open in 1972. Trump first publicly raised this theory shortly after he became president, in an April 2017 interview with the Associated Press. He brought it up again in his July 25 phone call with Ukraine’s apparently nonplussed president, Volodymyr Zelensky: “The server, they say Ukraine has it,” Trump told Zelensky. Thomas Bossert, who served as Trump’s first homeland security adviser, said Sept. 29, 2019 that the president has been repeatedly told by White House aides that the story has been “completely debunked.\"  CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a cyber and national security expert who was born in Russia and now is a U.S. citizen; he is not Ukrainian, as Trump frequently asserts. The company is based in California, not Ukraine, as Trump frequently claims.
