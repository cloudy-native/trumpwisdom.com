That's very nice that you bring that up. The fact is that Jerry Nadler was on the opposite side of this. And he thought it was a disgusting, terrible thing to even think about giving the Starr report but now we should give the Mueller report. And actually, the Mueller report is actually much tighter because the Starr report went to Congress.”","analysis":"Trump brought up old comments from Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who opposed the full release of independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s report on President Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky. “It’s grand jury material. It represents statements which may or may not be true by various witnesses. Salacious material. All kinds of material that it would be unfair to release,” Nadler said in 1998. But Nadler went on to say he was open to making public at least some of the report that had already been given to Congress.\n\nNow Trump is in the White House, and Nadler has changed his tune, the president suggests.\n\nBut there are some key differences here. Starr delivered his full, unredacted report to Congress in 1998, complete with grand jury testimony. Congress debated how much of the report to release to the public.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
