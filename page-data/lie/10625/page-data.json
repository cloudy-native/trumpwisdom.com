You know that better than anybody, you know it better than anybody what they did to Pennsylvania -- in particular, Ohio, Pennsylvania, some of the states in particular, frankly, North Carolina -- what they did was disgraceful, what they did to the workers. They took out your businesses. They moved them to other countries, they sold back the product with no taxes, nothing, you lost your jobs, we lost revenue and nobody even apologized except me.
