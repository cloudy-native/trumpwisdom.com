But it includes all ports of entry. And almost all suspected terrorists are apprehended at airports — not along the southern border. In a recent report, the State Department found “no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.” In other words, Trump’s border wall would do little to stop potential terrorists trying to enter the country.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31493, 27510, 7981, 8210, 7718, 7646, 7478, 7276","repeated_count":"8","date":"12/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
