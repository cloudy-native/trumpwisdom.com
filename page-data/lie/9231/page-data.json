He lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes, but has never explained why the Democrats would stuff the ballot box in states where Hillary Clinton was sure to win, such as California, and not in the three midwestern states that she narrowly lost. Trump makes reference to a so-called \"insurance policy\" at the FBI targeting him in case he won. But former FBI agent Peter Strzok has insisted that the reference to an insurance policy in his texts did not mean he or fellow agents were targeting Trump. The IG report mentioned by Trump also found that no improper biases or considerations went into the FBI's decision making in 2016. So in order to claim a scandal bigger than Watergate or the Teapot Dome, Trump is citing two things that did not happen or are certainly lack concrete evidence.
