He wants free federal housing for former inmates.”","analysis":"Biden says he would work toward “100 percent” housing for inmates being released from state or federal prison. He also proposes to end contracts with private prisons, which house about 10 percent of federal inmates. Somehow, in Trump’s parlance, this became an end to all prisons and free housing for all inmates. The prisoner reentry programs Biden supports are hardly radical; Trump’s own administration funds them. Former prisoners would not be getting “free housing,” and the prison system would not close.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"24062, 24121, 23531, 23565, 22939, 22846, 22610","repeated_count":"7","date":"07/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
