We have over 6,000 murderers that ICE has apprehended in our great Border Patrol and we owe them a debt of gratitude. Think of that, think of that 6,000 murderers we took off the streets...Under the Biden administration, these criminals would be set free. Under the Trump administration, these criminals are put in jail or they're sent home.”","analysis":"Biden is calling for a 100-day moratorium on deportations and continued enforcement of immigration law. He has said he would return to the Obama-era policy of prioritizing gang members and those convicted of violent crimes -- a policy Trump rescinded shortly before he began to separate families at the border. Many of the people ICE arrests and Trump calls \"criminal aliens\" are convicted of immigration offenses, not \"rape and murder\" or such violent crimes.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
