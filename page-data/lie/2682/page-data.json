Congress must change these Obama era, and other, laws NOW!”","analysis":"This is false. U.S. law treats unauthorized entry as a criminal offense, while it’s only a civil violation in Mexico. Prior to 2011, Mexico had an immigration law that made illegal entry into the country a crime, but that law was supplanted by a 2011 law that makes it a civil infraction and tries to balance tough enforcement with the respect for the rights of migrants within Mexico. Thus U.S. law, which now does deem illegal entry a crime, is a lot tougher than the current Mexican law. Laura González-Murphy, who advised officials in Mexico’s National Congress while the 2011 law was being drafted and wrote a book about the process, called it an “extremely humanitarian” policy. “It made the rights of migrants a priority,” she said.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"11428, 11919, 11829, 11127, 9808, 9818, 9643, 9704, 9623, 9483, 9597, 9603, 9439, 3817, 3549, 3487, 3014, 2682, 2815, 2830, 2690","repeated_count":"21","date":"04/04/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
