It didn't work out so well....You've been looking at things that you wouldn't have believed possible in our country, corruption at the highest level, a disgrace, spying, surveillance, trying for an overthrow.

Claims of spying and surveillance are based on FBI activities directed against Carter Page, who had already resigned from the Trump campaign. It also has been reported that an FBI informant in Europe, a professor named Stefan Halper, met with at least three people working on the Trump campaign in Europe. So far, there has been nothing to indicate whether there was a political agenda or a “spy” mandate as part of Halper's assistance for the FBI, which started after the agency opened a counterintelligence probe.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
