U.S. intelligence agencies gave assessments of Iran, the Islamic State and North Korea that differ from Trump's. But in each case, the intelligence chiefs were offering assessments of current conditions. Trump may seem to think that \"time will prove\" him right that Iran is unstable, the Islamic State is decimated, and North Korea is laying off its nuclear weapons ambitions, but that's not the case today.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
