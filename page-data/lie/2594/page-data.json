They have the highest taxes in the United States. … Hey, I have property in California, I will say. I don’t think too much about my property anymore but I have great property in California. The taxes are way, way out of whack and people are going to start to move pretty soon …. [The taxes are double and triple what they should be. And everybody that lives in California, they know it.”","analysis":"The president claimed that “everybody that lives in California” knows their taxes are too high. Readers beg to differ, especially when it comes to property taxes. When we first saw Trump’s remarks, we were inclined to agree that he was talking about property taxes, given the context. But White House officials say he was talking about income tax rates; he mentioned his properties to indicate being knowledgeable about the state.Trump’s imprecise language makes it difficult to reach a firm conclusion. California has the highest marginal income tax rate — within a very progressive system — but among the lowest property tax burdens. In other tax areas, it is not the worst, as Trump suggests.
