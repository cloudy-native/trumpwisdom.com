I get along with him very well, and we made this deal. But this is something the U.S. Has been trying to get for over 20 years with Mexico. They've never been able to do it. As soon as I put tariffs on the table, it was done. It took two days.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to Mexico's decision to place nearly 20,000 troops along its southern and northern borders to tamp down immigration flows from Central America to the United States. But Trump's claim that the U.S. has sought this change for over 20 years makes little sense. The Central American migration phenomenon began in 2014. And Mexico for decades has apprehended and deported Central Americans at rates that rival those of the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
