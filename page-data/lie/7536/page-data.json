I don't think they wanted open borders. Because most of them, if you go back to 2006, they all approved, essentially, a wall -- a very powerful fence -- which is pretty much the same thing. But in 2006, if you look -- Obama, you look at Hillary Clinton, you look at Schumer, all of the people that are standing up protesting -- they think it's good for them politically.”","analysis":"Many Democrats voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was signed by President George W. Bush and authorized building a fence along about 700 miles of the border between the United States and Mexico. It passed 283-138 in the House, with 64 Democrat votes, and 80-19 in the Senate, with 26 Democrat votes. But the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself has called the 2006 fence a \"nothing wall.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31482, 24398, 20407, 16846, 16087, 14949, 15579, 14266, 14609, 13946, 13862, 13709, 12022, 11920, 11784, 9587, 9239, 8643, 8479, 8483, 8282, 7811, 8013, 8095, 8104, 7771, 8090, 8221, 7863, 7699, 7685, 7594, 7431, 7536, 7446","repeated_count":"35","date":"11/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
