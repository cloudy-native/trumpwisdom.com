They rip us off on trade, right? They rip us off like crazy. We lose hundreds of billions of dollars on trade. It’s been going on a long time. They don't take your product. They don't take your cars. They don't take your farm product. They don't take your medical machines.”","analysis":"The E.U. is the largest export market for the United States, and those exports supported an estimated 2.6 million U.S. jobs in 2015, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The United States runs a trade deficit with the E.U. when looking only at goods, and runs a trade surplus of about $60 billion when looking only at services. Combined, the U.S. goods and services trade deficit with the E.U. was $109 billion in 2018. International trade works in such a way that some countries dominate some markets and don't compete as much in others. The French have trade restrictions on U.S. wine, just as the United States has trade restrictions on French clothing.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
