Nearly two thirds of American raw steel companies have gone out of business. More than one third of the steel jobs have disappeared. Six primary aluminum smelters, which is a big deal, have permanently shut down since just 2012.”","analysis":"Trump has failed to understand that the U.S. steel industry has reduced workers because of greater efficiencies, not imports. Labor productivity has seen a fivefold increase since the early 1980s, going from an average of 10 hours of work for each finished ton to an average of two hours in 2016, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Many North American plants were producing a ton of finished steel in less than one person-hour, AISI said.Thanks to automation, workers in control rooms operate equipment that used to require hundreds of people. Open vessels once used to melt raw material have been replaced by more labor- and energy-efficient furnaces.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/08/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
