It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess.”","analysis":"Trump indicated he was backing up this statement by noting that “jobs are pouring out of the country. ... The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea.” The state of foreign policy is open to interpretation — Trump claimed he was developing “a plan for the defeat of ISIS,” the terrorist group in Iraq and Syria. But the economy was in pretty good shape when Trump became president, especially compared with the economic crisis that Obama inherited in 2009. In January 2009, coinciding with the last labor report of the George W. Bush administration, nearly 800,000 jobs disappeared, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared with the nearly 230,000 jobs added in January 2017. (Trump has given himself credit for the January numbers, but the data was collected when Obama still held office.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"0124","repeated_count":"1","date":"02/16/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
