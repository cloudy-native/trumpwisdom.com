Now, everybody in this room, because you're from Indiana, you understand life. You would say, OK, good. Now, you're going to build a new one for $50 million. You're going to have $200 million leftover. You're going to have a nice embassy. OK. But it didn't work that way. So, they sold the embassy for like around 250 million. They then went out and bought a terrible piece of land in a lousy location. And they just opened a new embassy in a bad location for $1.2 billion. What a great deal! What a great deal! So, three months ago, I was supposed to go over to cut the ribbon on the new embassy. But I couldn't do it. I said I'm not doing. I won't do it. Does that make sense? I'm not going to do. So, I didn't.”","analysis":"Trump, perhaps wary of planned protests if he visited London, came up with a phony excuse. The price that could be obtained for the old embassy was limited because it was named an historic building and thus cannot be significantly changed. Nevertheless, the entire cost-- about $1 billion, not $1.2 billion --  was financed through the sale of the existing chancery and other buildings.
