Ethanol is safe.”","analysis":"Trump has long resisted demands by farmers that a 15% ethanol-gasoline blend known as E15 be permitted for year-round use; most gasoline sold in the U.S. is a 10% blend known as E10. We're including this statement because Trump pitches it as help for farmers -- the \"saved Ethanol\" -- rather than admitting an election-year conversion. Farmers were not fooled.  “The announcement made today is little more than an election-year gambit,” {said} Chris Gibbs, the board president of Ohio-based policy group Rural America 2020. “You can't sell out to Big Oil for the first 3 1/2 years of your presidency and then expect farmers to believe you with 52 days to the election,” Gibbs said. “You can't undo 4 billion lost gallons of biofuel with last minute election games.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
