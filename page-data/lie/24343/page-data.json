American students are not taught from propaganda tracts. The protests are not a result of \"left-wing indoctrination\" so much as racial injustice, police brutality, anti-Trump sentiments and some rioters.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
