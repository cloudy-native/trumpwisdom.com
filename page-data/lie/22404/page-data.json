And Biden's staff did the same thing; they donated a lot of their money to get them out of jail so that everyone was right back on the streets.”","analysis":"We looked into this and it turned out The Minnesota Freedom Fund was only a bit player in the release of people charged during the protests. The vast majority of people — 92 percent — had to pay no bail. So Trump is wrong to suggest that the donations led to the release of many protesters or rioters.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"28943, 28826, 26645, 27080, 27253, 25875, 24845, 24627, 24399, 23098, 22404, 22994","repeated_count":"12","date":"08/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
