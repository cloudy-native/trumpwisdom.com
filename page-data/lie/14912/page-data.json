They were doing such a poor job. You don't hear that anymore do you? You don't hear it anymore. Our veterans, for the first time, are taken care of to a level that has never happened in our country before, and maybe, most importantly, right now is the world the way it is.”","analysis":"There continue to be reports of veterans being abused and facing long wait times for treatment. (For instance, just before Trump made this comment, there were news stories about 11 suspicious deaths at a VA Medical Center, a VA pathologist who misdiagnosed 3,000 cases and wasn't fired until 2018, a VA physician who allegedly sexually assaulted more than a dozen patients, and how a veteranat a VA facility was allegedly bitten by ants 100 times before his death.) The VA Choice bill -- known as the MISSION Act -- was mostly an update of a law passed by Obama in 2014. Despite Trump’s claims, it's not clear that veterans are facing shorter wait times. The MISSION Act only took effect in 2019. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017 was an important measure for accountability and whistleblower protection at the VA. But this law builds on firing authority given to the VA secretary through the Choice, Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 in response to the 2014 Phoenix VA scandal. Trump frequently claims that before the law, no one could be fired, but the agency fired about 2,000 people a year before the law was enacted.
