I'll tell you about that. I made a deal. I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country.

Yeah, but you know that's the way it is.”","analysis":"President Donald Trump falsely claimed that he deserved credit for the Nobel Peace Prize awarded in 2019 to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for negotiating a peace deal between Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea following 20 years of bloody conflict. Trump had nothing to do with these peace negotiations. (Trump offered to help negotiate an agreement between the Ethiopian prime minister and Egypt's prime minister over a dam on the Nile. But that's a different story.) ","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
