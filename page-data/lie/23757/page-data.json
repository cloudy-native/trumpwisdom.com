The outbreak was so rampant that the Obama administration told states to stop testing.

The Obama administration decided that it would conserve government resources if it assumed swine flu cases with certain symptoms and risk factors could be deemed “probable” H1N1 flu. So testing for the flu did not end, just extensive testing to identify this particular strain. Laboratory-confirmed deaths continued to be counted.  “The 2009 H1N1 strain was highly transmissible but did not induce more severe illness in adults or children than typical seasonal influenza viruses,” said Tom Frieden, who was CDC director from 2009 to 2017. “Therefore, most people who contracted the virus had no reason to seek diagnosis or care; for every laboratory confirmed case from April to October 2009, there were estimated to be 79 cases that did not seek testing. So it was never practical to identify cases, trace their contacts, and ask exposed people to quarantine. In July 2009, the CDC advised states it was no longer necessary to report the individual cases up for aggregation — but never ‘stopped testing.’ Collecting national data was no longer important because under those circumstances, the data were not a good measure of the scale of the epidemic, nor actionable for contact tracing.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"23757, 21158, 20874","repeated_count":"3","date":"09/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
