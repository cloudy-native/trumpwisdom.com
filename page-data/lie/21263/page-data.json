If it reached my desk, I would have done something about it.”","analysis":"Trump further dissembled in this “Axios on HBO” interview by claiming that the intelligence never reached his desk. He may not have been orally briefed, but the Russian bounties were included in the written briefing that previous presidents read daily. The New York Times, and later others, reported that information on the Russian bounties appeared at some point in late February in the presidential daily brief (PDB), a written summary of intelligence that previous presidents are known to have read. The Washington Post has reported that Trump “routinely skips reading the PDB and has at times shown little patience for even the oral summary he takes two or three times per week.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
