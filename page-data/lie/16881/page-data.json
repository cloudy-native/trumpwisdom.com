But experts say the improvement in the economy may not be the only reason for the decline. Several states have rolled back recession-era waivers that allowed some adults to keep their benefits for longer periods of time without employment. Reports have also suggested immigrant families with citizen children have dropped out of the program, fearing the administration’s immigration policies. Moreover, the number of people collecting benefits has been declining since fiscal year 2014.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"16881, 15664, 15513, 14588, 14655, 15095, 12823, 13656, 12750, 12669, 12398, 11595, 11548, 11489, 11793, 10605, 10468, 10184, 9698, 9110, 8952, 8610, 7345, 7375, 6722, 6873, 6950, 7096, 7139, 6739, 7054, 6046, 6306, 6245, 6015, 6199, 6392, 6170, 6495, 5904, 5414, 5599, 5363, 5315, 5523, 5820, 5840, 5220, 5767, 5123, 5691, 4797, 4855, 4968, 4697, 4432, 4583, 4342, 4227, 3706, 4341, 2870","repeated_count":"62","date":"02/04/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
