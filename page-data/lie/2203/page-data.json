Our companies have been decimated, and those companies are going to be coming back strong. … A lot of workers; a lot of jobs.”","analysis":"There’s no anecdotal evidence or research that indicates Trump’s tariff will revive this manufacturing sector, which is dominated by low-wage countries. Instead, independent analysts, solar industry leaders and their national trade association say the tariff will price solar installation companies out of the game in places where their projects could be competing with wind or natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimated that 23,000 net jobs would be lost in the first year of Trump’s tariff, and tens of thousands more in the following three years before it expires.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"3594, 4062, 3445, 3496, 2767, 2751, 2540, 2752, 2753, 2754, 2203","repeated_count":"11","date":"01/23/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
