These are the states that I had to win. In swing state after swing state, the number of ballots rejected has been dramatically lower than what would have been expected based on prior experience. That means years and years of voting. In Georgia, just 0.2%. That's substantially less than 1% of mail-in ballots have been rejected, in other words, almost none have been rejected. They took everything. Nothing was rejected, practically, compared to 6.4% in 2016, and there are those that think that 6.4% was a low number.”","analysis":"Trump is conflating the ballots rejected just for signature issues in this election with ballots rejected in past elections for all reasons — usually for arriving too late. The percentage of mail-in ballots rejected in Georgia due to signature issues this year was about the same as in the 2016 and 2018 general elections.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
