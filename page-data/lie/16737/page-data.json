Revenue was estimated to keep going up, because the tax cut merely slowed the growth of revenue, it did not reduce it. If anything, revenue estimates have slightly declined for 2019 and 2020 since the passage of the tax cut. And revenue growth is sharply down in the period after the tax cut, compared with the period before it.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"16737, 16086","repeated_count":"2","date":"01/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
