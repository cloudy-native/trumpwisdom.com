Very bad and dangerous conditions, also severely impacting the Pacific Ocean and water supply.”","analysis":"Trump's remarks were roundly condemned as ridiculous. San Francisco Mayor London Breed: the city's sewer system \"ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city's wastewater treatment plants.\" David Lewis, executive director of nonprofit Save the Bay: \"In San Francisco, all solids in that stormwater and sewage water are removed. And what comes out of the plant is sometimes cleaner than the water that many people in this state are drinking.\" San Francisco Chronicle: \"Storm drain runoff is piped to one of two city treatment facilities, the Southeast Treatment Plant in the Bayview neighborhood or the Oceanside Treatment Plant near the zoo. Any pollutants would be treated at those points if they haven't already been filtered out at catch basins beneath city streets, according to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
