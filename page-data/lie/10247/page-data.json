Look at Harley-Davidson. I met with him three years ago, one of my first meetings with Harley-Davidson, I said to the people, they are very nice, they would tell me tough to do business in certain kinds -- how are you doing in India? They said, \"Oh, we don't do any business there.\" So they weren't even complaining because for so many years. So India charged 100 percent tariff on a Harley-Davidson. But when they send their motorcycles, and they may come to us, we charge them nothing. So I called up Prime Minister Modi. I said unfair. He cut it 50 percent, but I said that's not good enough because, look, it's 50 percent to nothing.”","analysis":"The president is referring to a favorite example of his — Harley-Davidson motorcycles. India recently announced it would reduce the duties from 100 percent to 50 percent, but Harley already got around that higher duty by assembling in India most of the 4,500 motorcycles sold in the country. Harley, for its part, says it is indifferent to the matter and has no objection to India’s import duties. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) also says the Wisconsin-based company opposes higher tariffs for steel and aluminum because of the potential negative impact on its sales.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"18135, 12429, 11722, 10247, 9682, 9107, 8376, 5250, 5266, 4086, 3821, 2465, 2451, 2380, 0897, 0921, 0540, 0276, 0196, 0197","repeated_count":"20","date":"04/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
