CBP did report around 17,000 encounters in 2018 with people convicted of crimes. But a breakdown for the first 11 months of fiscal 2018 shows that 63 percent of the encounters were at ports of entry, which includes airports and not just people “at the border.” The 17,000 figure encompasses all types of crimes, including violent and nonviolent offenses such as immigration violations. CBP data show 46.5 of all the convictions (not encounters) were for illegal entry or reentry in the same 11-month period.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
