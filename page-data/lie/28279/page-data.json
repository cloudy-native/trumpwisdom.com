And, you know, the problem with wind is, in the United States, we’re subsidizing these wind towers all over the place because wind doesn't work — for the most part, doesn’t work without subsidy. And I don't want to be subsidizing things that don't have to be subsidized. The United States is paying tremendous amounts of money on subsidies for wind. I don't like it. I don't like it. I don't want to do that.”","analysis":"Our colleagues at FactCheck.org <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2019/07/does-wind-work-without-subsidies/\">dug into</a> this Trump claim and found that analysts disagree on whether this is true: \"By some metrics, wind power is already competitive with fossil fuels without extra financial help. But other measures don't reach the same conclusion — and projections vary about what will happen to the industry when its biggest subsidy goes away.\" We are including this line in this database because Trump is so definitive in his assessment, rather than acknowledging the issue is subject to debate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"28278","repeated_count":"1","date":"06/29/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
