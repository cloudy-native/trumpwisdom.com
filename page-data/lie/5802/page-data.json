Here's a guy who destroyed practically by himself the city of Newark, New Jersey. He was such a bad mayor.”","analysis":"Booker was mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013. He had a mixed record on crime and education. But he was in office during the recession and left the city with healthier finances, pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars in private investments, and saw the city's population increase after a long trend of decline. The most common substantive criticism is that Booker didn't do enough to improve the city, not that he destroyed it.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
