So we want to get rid of chain migration.”","analysis":"Trump made this statement about 29-year-old terror suspect Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, saying he was responsible for bringing 23 relatives into the United States. No agency has confirmed this figure or explained where it came from. Experts say it is implausible because Saipov only had a green card, meaning he could only bring in his wife (already in the U.S.) or his minor children (already U.S. citizens).
