That was what was going to happen. Millions of people would have been killed. President Obama told me when I sat just before taking office. He said the single biggest problem this country has is North Korea. And he said he was, you know, very close to going to war, but fortunately his time was up. That his time is up. He would have been in a war. Millions of people would have been killed.”","analysis":"Trump goes far out on a limb by saying the U.S. would be at war with North Korea but for him. And also by saying millions of people would have been killed. The president indicates North Korea has let up its nuclear activities since he and Kim Jong Un signed a vague joint statement on denuclearization June 12. But experts say and satellite imagery indicates that North Korea continues to pursue a nuclear program. The Washington Post reported that U.S. spy agencies are seeing signs that North Korea is constructing new missiles at a factory that produced the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/29/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
