Surveys by major pollsters <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Politics_Polls/status/1319497720244162560\">showed</a> Biden was considered the winner. A Politico/Morning Consult flash poll found that 54 percent of debate watchers believed Biden won the matchup, while 39 percent said Trump did. YouGov found that Biden won 54 per cent to 35 percent against Trump. A Data for Progress progressive poll gave the win to the former vice president with 52 per cent of support over the 41 percent going for Trump. And a CNN instant poll <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/22/politics/cnn-poll-final-presidential-debate/index.html\">found</a> that 53 per cent of debate watchers thought Biden won the debate over the president, who earned support from 39 percent of viewers.
