Trump is alluding to the argument that some restrictions in the deal sunset over time and that Iran could pursue a nuclear weapons program in secret once those restrictions are gone. But it's a huge stretch into falsehood to say the deal gives Iran the right to nuclear weapons when it says the opposite.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
