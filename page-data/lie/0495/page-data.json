And, frankly, this should've been done and taken care of by the Obama administration. Should've been taken care of by the Bush administration. Should've been taken care of by Clinton.”","analysis":"All three presidents tried to deal with North Korea. Bill Clinton negotiated a nuclear agreement with North Korea that froze its plutonium program and was working on a missile deal. But that agreement fell apart under George W. Bush. But then Bush tried to negotiate a deal, even lifting sanctions on North Korea. But those tentative agreements fell apart as well and Obama was unable to make much more progress.
