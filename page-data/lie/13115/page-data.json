Michael Atkinson wrote that the whistleblower had \"some indicia of an arguable political bias ... in favor of a rival political candidate.\" In testimony to Congress, sources said the ICIG explained that the individual had some type of professional relationship with one of the Democratic candidates, though the nature of it was not been fully explained. \"Our client has spent their entire government career in apolitical, civil servant positions in the\nExecutive Branch,\" a statement from the whistleblower's attorney said. \"In these positions our client has come into contact with presidential candidates from both parties in their roles as elected officials – not as candidates.\" In any case, when submitting the whistleblower referral, Atkinson said: \"Such evidence did not change my determination that the complaint relating to the urgent concern 'appears credible,' particularly given the other information the ICIG obtained during its preliminary review.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
