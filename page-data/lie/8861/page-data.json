But I believe he would have gone to war with North Korea. I think he was ready to go to war. In fact, he told me he was so close to starting a big war with North Korea. Now, where are we now?”","analysis":"Former Obama administration aides deny this is the case. The meeting between Obama and President-elect Trump was without staffers, but Ben Rhodes, a top Obama national security aide, told The Fact Checker that Obama “talked to him about the seriousness of the threat posed by North Korea. And frankly I think you would find that there was no reporting or suggestion in 2016 that we were somehow on the brink of war with North Korea.”\n\nBob Woodward, in his book “Fear: Trump in the White House,” reported that after North Korea conducted a nuclear test in 2016, Obama posed the question to aides of whether the North Korean nuclear threat could be eliminated in a surgical military strike. But after a review, Obama concluded that only a ground invasion would eliminate the threat and that such an action was “unthinkable.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"28752, 27898, 27739, 28239, 27155, 26504, 26215, 25331, 25192, 25966, 25899, 25113, 24550, 24551, 24359, 24388, 24459, 24254, 23938, 23787, 23858, 23554, 20954, 22995, 22341, 21520, 21865, 22780, 20676, 20251, 19543, 19491, 18047, 15798, 15799, 14164, 12213, 11680, 11401, 11977, 11006, 11021, 11915, 11443, 11759, 11133, 10051, 9217, 8891, 8861, 8709, 8638, 8474, 8521, 8584, 8395, 8082, 7906","repeated_count":"58","date":"02/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
