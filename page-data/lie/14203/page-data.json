The Moody's report was very interesting. Median household income under eight years of Obama was up $975. That's eight years. Under eight years of President Bush -- we had President Obama, $975. President Bush, $400. Eight years, eight years, $400, $975. Me, two and a half years, it's up $7,000. $5,000 plus $2,000 for the tax cut that everybody got. So you add the $2,000 to the $5,000. So you've got one up $1,000 or $975. The other one's up -- that's over eight years, each one. I'm only here two and a half years. And I beat them by many times in two and a half years. What's that percentage like proportionately? So it's up $5,000 plus $2,000 -- so it's up $7,000, median household income. That's a record.”","analysis":"Trump is citing data from a private research company that measures median household income on a monthly basis, frequently comparing the gain through August 2019 against the record of Barack Obama and George W. Bush. But measuring gains through presidential terms is misleading, as the nation’s economy is derived from many factors that do not involve presidential decisions — and are far beyond a president’s control. Both Obama and Bush had to contend with recessions. The data cited by Trump, via Sentier Research, is volatile and it's unclear if the recent gains will be sustained. (The Census Bureau said median household income in 2018 was $63,179 in 2018 dollars, a gain of $1,380 since 2016 but not statistically different than in 2017.) When we compare the last 31 months of Obama to the first 31 months of Trump using Sentier's data, median household income rose 5.6 percent under Obama and 7.1 percent under Trump, respectively. Since June 2011 (the low point for median income after the recession) through the end of Obama’s term, median household income rose 10.3 percent. Trump, in effect, is piggybacking off that growth. [Note: the Census Bureau in Sept. 2020 released <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-270.html\">a report</a> that said median income in 2019 was $68,703, or a gain of $5,524 since 2016. But then of course median incomes plunged during the 2020 pandemic.]","pinocchios":"2","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"29592, 30102, 28904, 28332, 27985, 27830, 27720, 26827, 26656, 27086, 27131, 27427, 27300, 26381, 26455, 26200, 26136, 25683, 24914, 24831, 24603, 17267, 15425, 14934, 14562, 15670, 14409, 14083, 14086, 14203, 14589, 13995, 13595","repeated_count":"33","date":"10/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
