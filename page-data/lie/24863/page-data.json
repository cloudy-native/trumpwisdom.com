They wouldn't cover it, right? For two of them....When Barack Obama, Barack-Hussein Obama got nominated, no, when Barack -- when Barack-Hussein Obama got nominated, he didn't know why he was nominated. It was like right at the very beginning. He didn't do anything, he did nothing and he got nominated. It was the biggest story I've ever seen.”","analysis":"Nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize is not as “big” of a deal (or as pristine) as the president suggests. Indeed, there are 318 candidates for the 2020 prize. Moreover, it does not somehow guarantee a fond place in history. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trumps-nobel-nonsense/\">put it clearly</a>: “Indeed, some of history’s most vilified figures have been nominated for the prize. Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was nominated twice: in 1945 for his effort to end World War II and again in 1948 by a professor from the Czech Republic. And fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was nominated in 1935 by two law professors, one from Germany and the other from France. (Adolf Hitler was nominated in 1939 — the nomination was later withdrawn — by “an anti-fascist member of the Swedish parliament who never intended his submission to be taken seriously,” according to Nobel archives.)” Sometimes, Trump will falsely say the news media avidly covered Barack Obama's nomination but not his; in fact, it had not been reported that Obama had been nominated, which is why Obama winning the honor was such a surprise -- and covered extensively in the media.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"30271, 29719, 28578, 28256, 27961, 26678, 26474, 26126, 25704, 25578, 25327, 25352, 25220, 25263, 26579, 25902, 25125, 25059, 24863, 24690, 24612, 24391, 24176, 24101, 23935, 23936, 23785, 23856","repeated_count":"28","date":"09/21/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
