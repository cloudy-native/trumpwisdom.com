Sometimes they go to their car, put on a different hat, put on a different shirt, come in and vote again. Nobody takes anything. It’s really a disgrace, what’s going on.”","analysis":"Trump claims he has seen this sort of voter fraud. We highly doubt it. Perhaps it came in a dream? At least 34 states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. So not only would a fraudster need a new hat and shirt, but also phony IDs that match records of registered voters. It is difficult to imagine how such a scheme could be implemented on a vast scale.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/14/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
