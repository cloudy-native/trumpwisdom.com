So important for our GREAT American farmers and ranchers. Help for GA, FL, IA, NE, NC, and CA. Puerto Rico should love President Trump. Without me, they would have been shut out!”","analysis":"This is gaslighting, as Trump pushed to exclude Puerto Rico from the disaster aid bill. Democrats were onboard with Sen. David Perdue's disaster relief bill, according to Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. But then Trump told Senate Republicans to exclude funding for Puerto Rico's recovery from Hurricane Maria. The resulting bill excluded some Puerto Rico funding and Democrats were opposed.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
