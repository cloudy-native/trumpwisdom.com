But on one of their pieces of paper that they give out with the Canadian flag -- and I love Canada, by the way. I have to tell you, I love Canada -- but they have the Canadian flag -- very official -- it's says, '$97.8 billion deficit that the United States has,' or they put it down as a surplus to Canada. And I said, 'Well, if we're doing so well with Canada, how come it's $98.7 billion?' Okay? That's a lot of money.”","analysis":"Trump says the Canadians say they “make 97.8 billion dollars” off trade with the United States, but Canada makes no such claim. The $100 billion number was not discovered because the Canadians were caught “bragging” but because his staff concocted a number by misleadingly citing a Canadian statistical website. The facts are not on Trump’s side when it comes to complaining about a trade deficit with Canada, because there is a trade surplus, according to numerous U.S. government reports.
