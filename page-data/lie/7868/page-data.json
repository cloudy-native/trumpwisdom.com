The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!”","analysis":"Trump lives in his own reality when it comes to immigration and the border. Democrats support tougher border security measures, just not Trump's wall. Southern border apprehensions have been declining for 20 years and are down more than 80 percent from their most recent peak in 2000. Immigration from Mexico has declined dramatically in that same period, but families journeying from Central America to seek asylum are coming in waves. Most drugs are smuggled in through legal ports of entry, and those entryways would still exist if Trump's wall were built. Trump exaggerates the link between immigration and crime; almost all research shows legal and illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population. Any wall would be built a mile or so inland from the border. Many of the families attempting to immigrate from Central America are seeking asylum. To petition for asylum, a person needs to be on U.S. soil under current law. So in theory, immigrants could cross the border and file a legally valid petition for asylum before reaching Trump's wall. The incentive would still exist. Most illegal immigration is the result of visa overstays.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"29704, 28866, 28040, 27212, 27438, 25217, 25225, 26528, 21524, 22260, 22161, 22258, 21888, 21503, 21414, 21458, 20643, 20542, 20034, 19988, 20304, 20758, 20324, 19357, 19689, 19299, 18729, 19165, 19168, 18609, 18571, 17525, 18365, 17394, 17396, 18300, 16200, 16082, 15885, 14781, 14947, 14878, 14425, 15334, 15370, 14975, 15469, 14118, 14200, 14645, 14003, 13161, 13231, 13246, 12806, 13714, 13719, 12998, 12733, 12571, 11600, 12257, 11531, 11566, 11335, 11429, 12062, 12176, 11313, 11287, 11263, 11204, 11782, 11030, 10906, 10759, 10637, 10488, 10875, 10299, 10256, 9916, 9856, 9885, 9765, 9302, 9250, 9306, 9284, 9144, 8796, 8669, 8369, 8454, 8313, 8318, 8333, 8300, 8259, 8058, 8043, 8163, 8181, 8235, 8238, 7868, 7731, 7669, 7675, 7649, 7553, 7350, 7356, 7382, 7387, 7403, 7217, 6736, 6886, 6964, 6967, 7104, 7110, 7116, 7133, 7154, 6666, 6797, 6860, 6894, 6903, 6521, 6598, 6617, 6764, 7033, 7084, 6541, 6556, 6626, 6641, 6302, 6304, 6242, 5246, 5239, 6385, 6165, 6483, 5459, 5883, 5589, 5354, 5295, 5307, 5310, 5506, 5208, 5273, 5970, 5011, 4871, 4640, 4423, 4393, 4485, 4578, 4390, 4566, 4236, 3685, 4196, 3742, 4108, 4134, 4093, 3608, 4054, 3452, 3568, 4011, 3547, 3830, 3979, 3981, 3505, 3522, 3823, 3958, 3383, 3403, 3169, 3197, 3177, 3195, 3171, 2691, 2689, 2533, 2242, 2171, 1809, 1713, 1542","repeated_count":"204","date":"01/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
