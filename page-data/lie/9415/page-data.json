A Suffolk/USA Today Poll, just out, states, “50% of Americans AGREE that  Robert Mueller’s investigation is a Witch Hunt.” @MSNBC  Very few think it is legit!

The Suffolk University/USA Today survey, taken March 13-17, asked: “President Trump has called the Special Counsel’s investigation a ‘witch hunt’ and said he’s been subjected to more investigations than previous presidents because of politics. Do you agree?” Of the voters questioned, 50.3 percent of them answered “yes”; 46.8 percent said “no”; 2.7 percent were “undecided”; and 0.2 percent “refused” to answer. But it’s not clear whether respondents were agreeing or disagreeing with the first part or the second part of the question — that the Russia investigation is a “witch hunt,” or that there have been more politically motivated investigations of Trump than other presidents. Other surveys about the special counsel's probe show much more support for the endeavor.
