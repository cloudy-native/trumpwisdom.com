For whatever reason, the media chose not to cover that very strongly. They don't like that image for me with helping people getting out of prison. They don't like that image of Trump, and so they wanted to keep that nice and low key. They didn't cover it very much, which is unfair, because they cover other things. Look at the media. Look at all of them. But that one they chose not to cover too much. But you know what? I feel very happy about it -- criminal justice reform.”","analysis":"Passage of the First Step Act was widely reported by major media and news networks. Journalists overwhelmingly credited Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for getting the legislation to reform prison sentencing past the finish line. The Washington Post and New York Times both ran front-page stories when the bill cleared the biggest obstacle: passing the Republican-controlled Senate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
