A lawyer for the two associates of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani who were indicted for illegal campaign contributions argued their work might be covered by executive privilege. Plus the two have met the president on more than one occasion, donated to his campaign, and were assisting Giuliani on behalf of Trump, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/nyregion/trump-giuliani-lev-parnas-igor-fruman.html\">according to the New York Times</a>. Whether or not the president was close with these men is not clear, but it’s clear that he did “know” them in some capacity. Parnas provided <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20200114_-_hpsci_transmittal_letter_to_hjc_-_new_evidence_attachment.pdf#page=38\">documents to Congress</a> that showed that eight days before this statement, Trump had discussed with his attorney the question of whether John Dowd, Trump's former attorney, could represent them. The email from Jay Sekulow said Trump had consented.
