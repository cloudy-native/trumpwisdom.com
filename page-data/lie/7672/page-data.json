The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.”","analysis":"Trump's trade war with China is certainly a step taken beyond previous presidents. But Russia is a different matter. During the campaign — or for months afterward — Trump repeatedly dismissed or belittled reports of Russian interference. Meanwhile, during the 2016 election campaign, the Obama administration raised alarms over possible interference by Moscow. Just weeks before the election, the administration announced that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. On Dec. 29, 2016, Obama imposed sanctions, including the expulsion of some three dozen Russian diplomats and intelligence officials and the closure of diplomatic compounds.Trump has been forced by Congress to accept some additional sanctions but he has already tried to lessen others.
