I don't have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show “weakness” and fall into their trap. This should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat Congresswomen, who I truly believe, based on their actions, hate our Country. Get a list of the HORRIBLE things they have said. Omar is polling at 8%, Cortez at 21%. Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away, but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party. See you in 2020!”","analysis":"Trump may not believe he is a racist. But racist tropes have made their way into Trump’s language on multiple occasions. Most recently, the president tweeted that four Democratic minority Congresswomen — all Americans — should “go back” to where they came from. Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron noted in a statement, ”The ‘go back’ trope is deeply rooted in the history of racism in the United States. Therefore, we have concluded that ‘racist’ is the proper term to apply to the language [Trump] used [in his tweets].” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"27006, 13711, 12524, 12481, 11696, 11271, 12207, 11329, 11330","repeated_count":"9","date":"07/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
