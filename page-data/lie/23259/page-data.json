Trump's nomination acceptance speech at the White House on Thursday was watched by 23.8 million people, just shy of the 24.6 million people who tuned in for Joe Biden's speech the week before. No one knows how many people streamed the conventions online or watched clips on social channels, but Trump routinely cites unverified figures.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"23259, 23213, 23087, 23089, 23091","repeated_count":"5","date":"09/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
