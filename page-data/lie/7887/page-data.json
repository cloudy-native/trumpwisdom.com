Probably it would pay for itself in a month or two. Because we lose pretty close to $250 billion on illegal immigration. And I would say that it could be on a monthly, or a couple of months, it would pay for the wall, pay for what we're talking about.”","analysis":"Trump has often claimed illegal immigration cost more than $100 billion, but recently he began to say $200 billion. Now, it's suddenly $250 billion. Trump appears to be relying on a study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes immigration and has been criticized for its methodology, which critics say overstates costs and understates benefits. The FAIR report comes up with a annual $135 billion annual cost by using a high-end estimate for the number of undocumented immigrants and counting the benefits consumed by the children of illegal immigrants born in the U.S., who under law are U.S. citizens – but not the fiscal impact of the children of unauthorized immigrants once they become adults. Other analysts say the cost of illegal immigration is much lower, likely not more than 1/10th the FAIR figure.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31494, 16480, 12997, 8455, 8358, 8037, 7887, 7925, 7658, 7668, 7645, 7271, 7285, 7566, 7264, 6699, 6782, 6932, 6965, 7118, 7155, 6809, 6600, 6765, 7072","repeated_count":"25","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
