We have a big imbalance of at least $17 billion.

The U.S. trade deficit with Canada for goods was $12.1 billion in 2016, but there was a trade surplus with Canada for services of $24.6 billion in 2016 -- so the United States actually had a $12 billion trade surplus with Canada that year. The 2016 trade deficit with Mexico was $56 billion.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"9678, 4800, 4807, 5010, 3696, 3872, 3942, 3399, 3349, 3341, 3303, 2617, 2806, 2585, 2449, 2423, 2276, 2073, 1956, 1854, 2115, 2145, 0520, 2113, 2116","repeated_count":"25","date":"02/13/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
