It's all built. It's all built. We got it. Not only did we get it approved, I got the building built, I said, find the building on a site that we own and they came to me. You know that story they're going to spend $2 billion to build an embassy. As that sounds like a lot -- and I called our great ambassador, I said David, do we have any land in Jerusalem? He said, yeah we have a great site. I said take a look at it, call me. Calls me said, there's a building on the site. We can renovate it. We're going to spend anywhere from a billion to two billion dollars right, I said, Well, let's do this, Can we do something? Yes, he calls me back a week later and said, sir, we can renovate the building fully for $350 thousand dollars and we have already. Thank you. It's first time in my life and my business career I ever did this. I said David, it's too cheap. It doesn't sound good. Normally I'd say, let's make it 250. I said David make it like 500 thousand ....So we built this building for under $500 thousand and it's been open for a long time and every president for many many decades has said they were going to do it and not one of them got it done, and I got it done and got the building built.”","analysis":"The new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem for about $400,000. (Trump sometimes claims it cost $500,000.) U.S. government documents <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/67072609\">show</a> the overall cost for the conversion now totals more than $23 million. Costs for the permanent embassy could well surpass $1 billion when all is said and done.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"10/16/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
