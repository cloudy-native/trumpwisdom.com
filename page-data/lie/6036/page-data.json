They won't take a piece of corn. They won't take wheat.”","analysis":"The U.S. has substantial wheat and corn exports to the European Union, though Canada is a strong competitor. There are no barriers to trading grain with Europe. U.S. consumers buy a lot of high-value products from Europe, causing a trade deficit. Meanwhile, German automakers sold 1.35 million vehicles in the United States in 2017, about 8% of total U.S. car sales. Of those, only 494,000 were exported from Germany to the United States — 25% less than in 2013, according to the German carmakers association. Most of the remainder were made in the United States and in Mexico, which has a free trade agreement with the United States.
