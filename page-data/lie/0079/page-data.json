Obstruction by Democrats!”","analysis":"This is false. Bill Clinton did not have a cabinet in place until March 11, George H.W. Bush had to wait till March 17 and Obama did not get a full cabinet until April 28. Trump would not have grounds to complain that at this point he has fewer Cabinet members confirmed than his predecessors. While Democrats have put up roadblocks, part of the reason for the delay is because paperwork has been slow in coming from some of Trump’s wealthier nominees.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/07/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
