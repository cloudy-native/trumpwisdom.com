They've agreed to pay a lot more money toward the United States. As you know, we've got 32,000 soldiers on South Korean soil, and we've been helping them for about 82 years. And we get nothing. We get virtually nothing. And South Korea and I have made a deal where they're paying a lot more money, and they're going to pay a lot more money.”","analysis":"This is totally false. The U.S. neither spends $5 billion a year on defending South Korea nor did the Koreans agree to pay $500 million more. They agreed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/world/asia/trump-south-korea.html\">a $70 million increase</a>, going to $925 million. Under a long-standing agreement, South Korea paid nearly $830 million a year to host U.S. forces -- representing half the cost. The Wall Street Journal <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/military-spending-spat-stirs-worry-over-u-s-forces-in-korea-11549195200\">reported</a> that Trump administration officials asked South Korea for a 50 percent increase. Trump may think he got it, but he didn't. As a percentage of its GDP, South Korea spends more on defense than the United States. And the U.S. keeps nearly 28,500 troops in South Korea not just to defend that country but to further its own interests in the region.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"16656, 15802, 12490, 12604, 11319, 10556, 10869, 10249, 8787, 8717, 8475, 6020, 5371, 5772","repeated_count":"14","date":"08/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
