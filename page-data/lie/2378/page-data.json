Indeed, this is the third year in a row that firearms prosecutions have increased, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Prosecutions rose 11.5 percent from 2015 to 2016, and another 10.8 percent from 2016 to 2017. There were 8,235 federal firearms prosecutions in fiscal 2017, which is the highest since 2008, when 8,484 were prosecuted. But it is still below a high of 11,015 set in 2004.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/23/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
