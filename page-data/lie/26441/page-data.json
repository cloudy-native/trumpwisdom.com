A report issued by his own White House <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/OTMP-Pennsylvania-Report.pdf#page=3\">says</a> the number of natural gas and oil industry jobs in the state is 26,000. The report adds that the natural gas and industry supports nearly 322,600 jobs in the state. That's a generous calculation that assumes the spending reverberates through the economy. But that's still far short of 900,000 jobs. \n","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30347, 29773, 29276, 29478, 29564, 29732, 30104, 28888, 28610, 28739, 28101, 28271, 27973, 26631, 26922, 27172, 27234, 26441, 26495, 26183, 25646, 25195, 25610, 25818, 23216, 23252","repeated_count":"26","date":"10/16/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
