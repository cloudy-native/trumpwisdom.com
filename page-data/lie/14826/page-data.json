FEWER cures! FEWER treatments! Time for the Democrats to get serious about bipartisan solutions to lowering prescription drug prices for families.”","analysis":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/12/12/house-democrats-pass-broad-prescription-drug-price-bill-election-marker/\">The Post reported</a> a CBO estimate of Pelosi’s prescription drug proposal “would save the government $456 billion between 2020 and 2029, and result in eight fewer new drugs coming to market over the next decade. Some Democrats have argued the bill would simply result in fewer copycat versions of existing drugs, rather than prevent development of new ones, but drug lobbyists argue the worst damage would extend beyond the first decade of the law’s implementation.” Trump may disagree with the bill, but it's clear House Democrats are at least attempting to do something.
