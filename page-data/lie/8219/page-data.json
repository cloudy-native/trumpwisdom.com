Many people are killed. It hurts both those who make the journey and so many communities bearing the cost in lives, safety, and dollars.”","analysis":"Trump lives in his own reality when it comes to immigration and the border. Southern border apprehensions have been declining for 20 years and are down more than 80 percent from their most recent peak in 2000. Trump exaggerates the link between immigration and crime; almost all research shows legal and illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population. Most drugs crossing the border are smuggled through legal ports of entry, according to the DEA. Those entry points would still exist if Trump's wall were built.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8821, 8567, 8592, 8487, 8487, 8495, 8504, 8505, 8382, 8292, 8274, 7803, 8010, 8007, 8130, 7794, 8189, 8202, 8229, 8246, 8246, 8250, 7762, 7762, 8004, 8077, 8092, 7970, 7971, 7979, 7980, 7999, 8209, 8219, 7960, 7880, 7861","repeated_count":"37","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
