He got, he had a problem. Medical problem but he retired, I'd say, 'Shinzo, you got to open some factories in Michigan. You got to open up some factories in the U.S. I don't care where. You got to open up factories Shinzo. You're selling too many cars made in Japan. You got to make them in the U.S.' And he'd say, Well, I don't do that. I mean, look, we don't have anything to do with that. This is done by the private sector.' I said, 'Shinzo, you're a powerful man. You can do it.' 'I really can't' I said, You have to do it.' Next day, they announced five companies were opening up factories, so that was yet another. And he's a great guy.”","analysis":"This story is faintly ridiculous in Trump's telling. One can see Trump pressing the Japanese prime minister to force Japanese companies to invest in the United States and Abe explaining that's not how the free market system works. Depending on the venue, Trump sometimes says the next day five auto plants were announced in Michigan -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-claims-he-rewarded-voters-in-michigan-by-persuading-japans-abe-to-get-car-companies-to-put-plants-there-that-didnt-happen-2020-09-22\">false</a> -- or five auto companies made announcements or he simply says \"five companies.\" None of that happened. (There were five new investments by Japanese automakers in Michigan, but only one of them is a manufacturing facility, which was announced on Jan. 30, 2017, just 10 days after Trump took office.) The Financial Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qz.com/905892/japans-shinzo-abe-will-promise-to-invest-more-in-the-us-but-that-probably-wont-shrink-the-trade-deficit-between-the-two-countries/\">reported</a> that Abe requested that Japanese companies thinking of investing in the United States come up with a \"tweetable\" figure for investment. He later gave Trump a chart that listed seven companies making investments, for a total of 14,300 jobs, but these were not all new factories. Moreover, Japanese companies <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trumps-false-auto-industry-claims/\">invested more</a> in the 2014-2016 period before Trump became president.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"30444, 29604, 28649, 27959, 24636","repeated_count":"5","date":"10/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
