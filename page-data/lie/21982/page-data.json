Now, the death tax is a big deal. So if you have a farm or a business, like Kirby, like your business, and you want to leave it to your beautiful family, which I just met, and they have to go out and get a big mortgage from a bank because they have big estate taxes -- call it whatever you want; we call it a death tax -- they don't have to do that anymore, Kirby. That's pretty good, right? So you'll be looking down and you'll be saying, 'They're happy.' They won't be losing -- losing the business or losing the farm. But we've slashed regulations; cut the death tax, estate tax -- got rid of it for the small farms and businesses.”","analysis":"This is an enormous stretch. Trump often claims he saved family farms and small businesses by gradually reducing the federal estate tax. (It was not fully eliminated, though Trump often says he got rid of it.) Reducing the estate tax primarily benefits the wealthy. The estate tax rarely falls on farms or small businesses, since only those leaving behind more than $5 million pay it. According to the Tax Policy Center, nearly 5,500 estates in 2017 — out of nearly 3 million — were subject to the tax. Of those, only 80 taxable estates would be farms and small businesses.
