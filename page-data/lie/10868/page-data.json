And you know that better than anybody. I got rid of it. I terminated it. It's got a beautiful title. Everything inside is a disaster for our farmers and, actually, for our country.”","analysis":"Trump signed an executive order instructing a review of a controversial regulation issued during the Obama administration, called the “Waters of the United States” rule. The Obama-era rule technically has an exemption for puddles. But opponents of the rule argue say since a “puddle” is not defined in the rule, the EPA can still regulate what some people may consider puddles. After the rule was issued in 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a nationwide stay blocking it from taking effect. No one has gone to jail for violating just the \"puddle\" aspect of the rule. The Trump administration proposed a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-and-army-propose-new-waters-united-states-definition\">new version of the rule</a> in December 2018, and a final rule was issued in December 2019, but opponents vow a long legal battle to block the \"arbitrary and unlawful\" attempt to erase the Obama rule from the books.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"21409, 21455, 21184, 17463, 16723, 14043, 14049, 13730, 12736, 11073, 10868, 10457, 6042, 2391, 2027, 1745, 0915, 0954, 0835, 0684, 0172","repeated_count":"21","date":"05/23/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
