We went through hell, my administration...There was a server -- the DNC server -- that never went to the FBI. The FBI didn't take it. It was taken by somebody that I guess -- it's CrowdStrike -- that's what I've heard.”","analysis":"The FBI and the Democratic National Committee disagree on whether the FBI requested access to the DNC's servers. Former FBI Director James Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the bureau made \"multiple requests at different levels\" to access DNC's servers, but the DNC said the FBI never requested access. The FBI felt it was not necessary to enter the DNC's premises and take custody of the affected servers, as agents were able to obtain complete copies of forensic images made by CrowdStrike, a private company. Comey testified that his staff told him this arrangement was an \"appropriate substitute.\"  ","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"19719, 16119, 13889, 14907, 14176, 13993, 11191, 10142, 7214, 4612, 4198, 3789, 3636, 4090, 3224, 2935, 2777, 1584, 1019, 0766, 0763, 7222, 0554, 0504, 13891, 0206","repeated_count":"26","date":"10/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
