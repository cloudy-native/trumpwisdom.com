It's like, this is the United States, and ICE goes in, and MS-13, they're afraid of ICE. You know why? Because ICE is much tougher than they are; that's all they fear. And they go in and they grab them by the necks and they throw them the hell into a paddy wagon and they take them either to jail, and throw them the hell out of the country. … And they cleaned out towns, they cleaned out towns of truly bad people, dangerous people.”","analysis":"This dystopian vision of a violent gang overrunning cities and towns across the U.S. is divorced from reality. MS-13 operates in a few areas such as Los Angeles, Long Island and the D.C. region. It's a gross exaggeration to say that towns are being liberated from MS-13, as if they had been captured.
