And you know with the people with respect to Manafort and all of them -- nothing had to do with Russian collusion. Nothing, not one.”","analysis":"Trump’s denial ignores information contained in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report. The report includes extensive references to Konstantin Kilimnik, a dual citizen of Russia and Ukraine who was a longtime business associate of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Kilimnik. The special counsel investigation found evidence supporting the FBI’s assessment of his ties to Russian intelligence. Manafort briefed Kilimnik on the campaign during an in-person meeting in spring 2016 in New York, according to prosecutors. That August, during a meeting at a New York City cigar bar, Kilimnik gave Manafort a proposal from former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych that would have guaranteed Russian control over a new autonomous region in eastern Ukraine, according to Mueller. They also discussed Manafort’s strategy for winning Democratic votes in Midwestern states. Before and after the August meeting, the report said, Manafort shared internal polling data with Kilimnik through Manafort deputy Rick Gates. Gates told prosecutors he sent Kilimnik the polling data via WhatsApp and then deleted the messages, according to Manafort’s instructions, Mueller said. Gates told Mueller’s office that he believed Kilimnik was a spy, a description Manafort disputed. Manafort expected Kilimnik to share the information with others in Ukraine and with Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, a one time Manafort business partner, the report said. But Kilimnik disputed the report, telling The Washington Post: “I have no ties to Russian or, for that matter, any intelligence operation.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
