Its net operating income fell 69 percent from 2015 to 2017; a Trump Organization representative testified last year that the reason was Trump’s damaged brand since he became president. Trump bought it in 2012 and spent several years renovating it, so it’s possible 2015 was the resort’s best year. There is no evidence as yet that it is coming back “very strongly.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
