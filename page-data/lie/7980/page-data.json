The border is a much more dangerous problem. It's a much bigger problem. It's a problem of national security. It's a problem of terrorists. You know, I talk about human traffickers. I talk about drugs. I talk about gangs.”","analysis":"Trump often claims against all evidence that immigrants bring higher crime rates. In this case, he included terrorists in the mix even though the State Department says there's no evidence of terrorists at the southern border. By any available measure, there is no new security crisis at the border. Apprehensions of people trying to cross the southern border peaked most recently at 1.6 million in 2000 and have been in decline since, falling to just under 400,000 in fiscal 2018. The decline is partly because of technology upgrades; tougher penalties in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks; a decline in migration rates from Mexico; and a sharp increase in the number of Border Patrol officers. The fiscal 2018 number was up from just over 300,000 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border for fiscal 2017, the lowest level in more than 45 years. There are far more cases of travelers overstaying their visas than southern border apprehensions. As for drugs crossing the border, Trump's wall would hardly make a difference. Most drugs are smuggled through legal ports of entry.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8821, 8567, 8592, 8487, 8487, 8495, 8504, 8505, 8382, 8292, 8274, 7803, 8010, 8007, 8130, 7794, 8189, 8202, 8229, 8246, 8246, 8250, 7762, 7762, 8004, 8077, 8092, 7970, 7971, 7979, 7980, 7999, 8209, 8219, 7960, 7880, 7861","repeated_count":"37","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
