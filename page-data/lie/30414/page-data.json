Yet according to our database of Trump claims, more than 100 times this year, Trump has peddled false claims or imaginary threats about voting by mail. Election experts say that mail voting is slightly more vulnerable to fraud than voting in person but that both methods are trustworthy because of the safety measures state officials use to verify ballots.\n\nA Washington Post <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/minuscule-number-of-potentially-fraudulent-ballots-in-states-with-universal-mail-voting-undercuts-trump-claims-about-election-risks/2020/06/08/1e78aa26-a5c5-11ea-bb20-ebf0921f3bbd_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_29\">analysis</a> of data collected by three vote-by-mail states with help from the nonprofit Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC) found that officials identified 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people out of about 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, or 0.0025 percent.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31510, 31061, 30954, 30745, 30788, 31437, 30729, 30555, 31573, 30414, 30398, 29137, 28492, 28838, 28033, 27941, 27901, 26752, 27384, 26353, 26416, 26199, 26257, 25765, 25407, 25397, 25167, 25598, 25223, 25224, 25289, 25294, 26001, 25794, 25957, 25772, 25814, 25119, 25121, 24982, 24990, 24973, 24980, 24873, 24898, 24790, 24703, 24719, 24492, 24353, 24454, 24463, 24469, 24315, 24158, 24047, 23919, 23972, 23975, 24026, 24028, 23344, 23572, 23429, 23217, 23279, 23209, 23210, 23136, 23092, 21060, 21062, 21539, 22019, 22029, 22042, 21964, 22395, 20968, 21016, 21203, 21525, 21555, 22430, 22463, 22470, 22486, 22509, 22559, 23011, 22271, 22283, 22300, 22955, 21713, 22149, 22153, 22878, 21873, 22757, 22864, 22872, 21751, 21271, 21294, 21378, 21035, 21037, 21039, 21739, 22640, 22646, 21642, 21517, 21457, 22565, 21154, 20901, 20657, 20536, 20083, 20177, 20181, 20243, 19907, 19364, 19385, 19372, 19348, 19777, 19767, 19772, 18867, 18880, 18925, 19728, 19696, 18945, 19469, 18623, 19442, 19447, 19448, 19114","repeated_count":"144","date":"11/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
