He made no mention of the travel restrictions at the time he made the comment. He later said he supported the restrictions. In any case, the virus was already spreading through the United States, and there is little evidence the travel restrictions on China saved lives, especially because the Trump administration did not rapidly set up an effective testing regimen, as did many other countries. Biden did not apologize.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"29829, 29914, 29375, 29425, 29693, 30075, 28441, 28849, 28058, 27882, 26972, 26748, 26652, 27126, 26977, 26442, 26299, 25677, 25551, 25429, 26568, 26003, 26045, 24955, 24673, 24618, 24555, 24557, 24579, 24446, 24270, 24213, 24037, 24074, 23998, 23749, 23751, 23863, 23522, 23619, 23689, 23727, 23493, 23288, 23073, 21926, 21029, 21546, 22435","repeated_count":"49","date":"09/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
