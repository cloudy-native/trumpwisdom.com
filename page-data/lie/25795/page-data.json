I paid many millions of dollars in taxes but was entitled, like everyone else, to depreciation & tax credits.”","analysis":"In response to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html\">New York Times expose</a>, Trump claims he has paid millions in taxes but his statements have no credibility unless he releases his tax returns. \"Donald J. Trump paid $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency. In his first year in the White House, he paid another $750,\" the Times reported after obtaining two decades of tax-return data. \"He had paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years — largely because he reported losing much more money than he made.\" Trump has tried to explain away the $750 by calling it a \"filing fee,\" but there is no such thing in the tax code. The Times reported that the $750 figure was on line 56 of Form 1040, which is for the amount of income tax that’s due.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"30192, 30263, 29981, 30090, 29022, 26961, 26055, 25795","repeated_count":"8","date":"09/28/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
