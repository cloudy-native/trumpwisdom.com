And then you didn't hear from him for two weeks because he got the hell knocked out of him by Crooked Hillary. For two weeks he went dead silent. They wouldn't let him out of the house.”","analysis":"Trump takes Clinton's comment out of context and twists its meaning. Bill Clinton’s remark on Oct. 3, 2016 about “the craziest thing I’ve ever seen” did not refer to the Affordable Care Act.  Instead, he was talking about the fact that people who did not qualify for insurance subsidies did not have a way to buy into Medicare or Medicaid. He noted that his wife, Hillary Clinton, had a plan to fix that defect.  Another Democrat, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton, had faulted Republicans for refusing to adjust the law, which he said made insurance “no longer affordable to increasing numbers of people.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"0250, 0030","repeated_count":"2","date":"08/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
