In this case, Trump’s baseline is January 2009, smack-dab in the middle of the longest U.S. recession since World War II. A close look at the numbers shows that most of the manufacturing job losses in the period Trump’s talking about happened during the first year of Obama’s administration, coinciding with the Great Recession that ended in June 2009. The bleeding did not extend throughout Obama’s eight years in office. In fact, the manufacturing sector began a slow but steady recovery in April 2010, during Obama’s second year in office. That steady rate of growth has continued and accelerated under Trump.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
