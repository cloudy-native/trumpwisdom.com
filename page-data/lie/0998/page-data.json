The factories and plants are coming back into the country. We're going to start making product in America again. And that's happening all over. As I mentioned yesterday, Foxconn is going to spend $10 billion in Wisconsin and other places.”","analysis":"Trump keeps taking credit for projects that were long in the works before he became president. For example, Fiat Chrysler's plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump. As for Foxconn, the company considered investing in U.S.-based facilities since 2014, though its initial plans to invest in Pennsylvania didn't pan out. Trump keeps celebrating the company's decision, but the Wisconsin Legislature had not yet approved the $3 billion incentives package amid concerns from taxpayers.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"9069, 6869, 6970, 4444, 4445, 4544, 3803, 3796, 4139, 3819, 3834, 2994, 2832, 2846, 2616, 2403, 2396, 2443, 2415, 2416, 2417, 2418, 2419, 2422, 2311, 2268, 2079, 1810, 1756, 1838, 1750, 1701, 1657, 1630, 1565, 1618, 1422, 1445, 1328, 1304, 1293, 1143, 1128, 1145, 1094, 1084, 1054, 1000, 0992, 0995, 1021, 0974, 0989, 1028, 0998, 0930, 0942, 0686, 0663, 0585, 0565, 0541, 0475, 0423, 0384, 0373, 0347, 0366, 0340, 0337, 0325, 0330, 0320, 0322, 0315, 0293, 0260, 0234, 0227, 0167, 0178, 0152, 0114, 0070, 0089, 0127, 0059","repeated_count":"87","date":"08/02/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
