If they own a business, they are twice as likely to flee. And if they are a victim of harassment by the A.G. of the state, like what they are doing to our great NRA, which I think will move quickly to Texas, where they are loved exas will defend them & indemnify them against political harassment by New York State and Governor Cuomo. So many people are leaving New York for Texas and Florida that it is totally under siege. First New York taxes you too high, then they sue you, just to complete the job.”","analysis":"The New York attorney general is investigating whether the NRA has violated the conditions of its tax-exempt status. Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) issued a directive \"to urge insurance companies, New York State-chartered banks, and other financial services companies licensed in New York to review any relationships they may have with the National Rifle Association and other similar organizations\" and encouraged those companies \"to consider whether such ties harm their corporate reputations and jeopardize public safety.\" There's no evidence either of these moves by New York state officials is illegal. Plus, New York state officials and its congressional delegation actively opposed a provision of Trump's tax-cut bill in 2017 that scrapped the state and local tax deduction (SALT), which led to an increase in taxes for many New York residents.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
