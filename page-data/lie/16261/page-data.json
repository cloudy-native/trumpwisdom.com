We never want to have a president hear that again, nor do we want a president to have to go through the crap that we’re going through right now.”","analysis":"Trump often repeats this claim that the military had run out of ammunition when he took office. We've given it Three Pinocchios. After targeting Islamic State operatives with tens of thousands of smart bombs and guided missiles, U.S. military officials began to say publicly that stockpiles were growing thin. But Trump never limits his comments to precision-guided missiles (PGMs) and instead gives the impression that all ammunition was running out. It bears mentioning that U.S. officials already were working on rebuilding PGM stockpiles before Trump took office.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30982, 30943, 29444, 29540, 30027, 28582, 28808, 28172, 27690, 27852, 27913, 27734, 28247, 26849, 27147, 27512, 26398, 26476, 26107, 25707, 25730, 25529, 25366, 19576, 18770, 18739, 19492, 19200, 18600, 18140, 17758, 18556, 18546, 18044, 16261, 15801, 14776, 15703, 14114, 14641, 14010, 13894, 13895, 13877, 13567, 13893, 13634, 13681, 6442","repeated_count":"49","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
