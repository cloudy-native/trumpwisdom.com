There’s no evidence refugees, in many cases women and children, endanger national security. Trump often makes false claims associating immigrants with crime despite a lack of evidence. No leading Democrat running for president has voiced support for unlimited refugee admissions, though top contenders such as Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren would raise the annual cap from 18,000 to more than 100,000.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
