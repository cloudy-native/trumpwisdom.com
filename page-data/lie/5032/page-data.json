When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much.”","analysis":"In August, George Washington University released its report, estimating excess deaths at between 2,658 and 3,290, with a midpoint of 2,975, in the six months after the storm made landfall. The investigation, based on actual death certificates, compared the number of deaths with typical death rates, adjusting for many variables, including the mass exodus from the island in the aftermath of the storm. Puerto Rico has accepted this as the official death toll. Other studies that examined a shorter time period, found between 1,000-1,200 people died as a result of the storm. And by the time Trump left the island that day, the death toll had already increased past 18 deaths.
