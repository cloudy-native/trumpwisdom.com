The rest of the $15 billion project -- roughly 450 miles at the end of Trump's administration -- was replacement for primary or secondary fencing. Congress balked at funding the concrete barrier he envisioned, so the project evolved into the replacement of smaller, older barriers with steel bollard fencing. The Washington Post <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/smugglers-are-sawing-through-new-sections-of-trumps-border-wall/2019/11/01/25bf8ce0-fa72-11e9-ac8c-8eced29ca6ef_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_34\">has reported</a> that the bollard fencing is easily breached, with smugglers sawing through it, despite Trump’s claims that it is impossible to get past. Trump sometimes asserts he's completed the \"wall\" but his plans had called for an additional 250 miles -- which Biden said he will not build.
