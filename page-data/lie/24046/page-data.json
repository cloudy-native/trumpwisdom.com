Steve Sisolak “controls the ballots,” is corrected during an interview, with the reporter noting that Nevada’s secretary of state, a Republican, is the top elections official while the governor doesn’t control ballots.] The governor totally controls it. The governor's the one who made it very difficult, and he controls it, and that's okay. He wants to play that game, we'll play the game. You know what the game is? The game is he's also controlling ballots, and it's a crooked operation. As far as I'm concerned, this is a rigged election.”","analysis":"Trump frequently accused Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) of rigging the 2020 election in the state and abusing the mail voting process. The claim is ridiculous, as the governor does not run elections in Nevada. That job falls to the secretary of state, which in 2020 was Republican Barbara Cegavske. There is no evidence of voter fraud on any significant scale in Nevada.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"24322, 24174, 24263, 24139, 24168, 24041, 24044, 24046, 24070, 23918","repeated_count":"10","date":"09/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
