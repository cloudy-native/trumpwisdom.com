I'll never beat this one percentage of judges approved. Do you know who the one is? Take a guess. George Washington, he gets 100 percent.<br /><br />Now, he had 100 percent. He named every one of them. But you know what? We'll have more of them. George Washington.”","analysis":"This is a confusing comment, as Trump starts out talking about the percentage of judges confirmed, but then says \"we'll have more of them,\" ie, judges. Trump has a long way to go to have appointed the most federal judges. Ronald Reagan has the record, with 383, followed by Bill Clinton with 378 and then Barack Obama with 329. Trump at the time he spoke had 97. Washington appointed 39.
