That didn't work out too well. I think you have more than she does, and maybe I do, too, and I have nothing.”","analysis":"Elizabeth Warren released the results of her DNA test, which showed that she likely had a sixth generation ancestor with Native American heritage in the mid-1800s. Early news reports had incorrectly suggested a range of 1/64th to 1/1024th, which some misreported as less than the average European-American. Trump has seized on the misleading news reports to incorrectly say she has no Native American heritage. She has some but her DNA is more than 95 percent European-American.
