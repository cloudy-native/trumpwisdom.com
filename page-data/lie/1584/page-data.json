FBI Director James Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the bureau made \"multiple requests at different levels\" to access DNC's servers, but the DNC said the FBI never requested access. The DNC ultimately allowed a private company to review its database and share findings with the FBI.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"19719, 16119, 13889, 14907, 14176, 13993, 11191, 10142, 7214, 4612, 4198, 3789, 3636, 4090, 3224, 2935, 2777, 1584, 1019, 0766, 0763, 7222, 0554, 0504, 13891, 0206","repeated_count":"26","date":"11/11/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
