But overall the impact on the auto industry was believed to be limited. The pact essentially preserved the status quo on trucks in the United States, the most profitable part of the market. Tariffs on trucks brought into the U.S. has forced foreign carmakers to build truck and SUV plants in the United States. Meanwhile, the TPP would have bolstered auto exports as other countries would have been forced to eliminate tariffs, such as Malaysia’s 30 percent foreign tax on autos, and Vietnam’s foreign tax of 70 percent on autos.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29694, 30506, 29600, 30012, 29109, 28782, 27835, 26663, 27467, 26117, 25254, 25894, 24092, 24002, 16192, 16334, 15517, 12422, 10245, 9540","repeated_count":"20","date":"10/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
