I said 'We will be saying Merry Christmas again.' We do, we do. What? Remember? The department stores, they didn't like Merry Christmas, that was not politically correct. Oh, yeah? We, they learned. And they'd say Happy New Year, and they'd have their card in the snow and the whole thing, but they wouldn't say Merry Christmas. They were all saying Merry Christmas again.”","analysis":"This claim is a strange favorite of the president's. There is no evidence that stores stopped using Merry Christmas in their advertising, were \"ashamed\" to do so or that any of this changed since Trump took office.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30893, 29550, 28895, 28121, 27796, 27862, 27164, 16615, 16418, 16244","repeated_count":"10","date":"10/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
