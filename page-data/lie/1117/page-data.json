But that does not mean DACA led to that crisis or even contributed significantly to it. A bigger factor appears to be a 2008 law signed by Bush — as well as violence and economic conditions in the countries the children fled. DACA may have helped foster a perception that Obama was lenient on illegal immigrants, but it is hard to draw a direct line, as Trump does.
