It was dead. It was closed. It was sealed and you weren't going to use it for anything as vice president. Joe Biden tried to obliterate the Iron Range. Seven plants were idle. The rest were closing very shortly. And they were bad, there was barely a whimper. I brought the Iron Range roaring back to life.”","analysis":"There are heated disputes over environmental issues along the Iron Range, but it’s a mistake to suggest that it was closed. It's been mined for decades. Tariffs from both President Obama and President Trump have spurred an economic recovery in the area, but experts take the positive outlook with a grain of salt given the volatility in the steel industry.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"28878, 26549, 26596, 26600, 25013, 24546, 24565","repeated_count":"7","date":"10/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
