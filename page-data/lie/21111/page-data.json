The Democrats had their chance, and they blew it. But we're going to take care of DACA because I'm going to be doing, in the not-too-distant future, pretty soon I'm going to be signing a new immigration action -- very, very big merit-based immigration action that, based on the DACA decision, I'll be able to do.”","analysis":"Trump is rewriting recent history here. He terminated DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, starting the current crisis over whether to extend protections for illegal immigrants who arrived as child with their parents.  Democrats came to Trump with a bipartisan plan that had been crafted in the Senate, but he rejected it. The bipartisan proposal had the most support in the Senate but was blocked from a final vote because of GOP opposition. Trump's proposal, which came with limits on legal immigration, received the least support.
