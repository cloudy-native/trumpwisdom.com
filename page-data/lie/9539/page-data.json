As a result of NAFTA, the United States, Canada and Mexico constitute an economically integrated market, especially for the auto industry. Auto parts and vehicles produced in each country freely flow over the borders, without tariffs or other restrictions, as thousands of part suppliers serve the automakers that build the vehicles. This is known as the “motor vehicle supply chain.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
