I suggested yesterday at FEMA that, along with Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, even Alabama could possibly come into play, which WAS true. They made a big deal about this...when in fact, under certain original scenarios, it was in fact correct that Alabama could have received some 'hurt.'”","analysis":"On Sept. 1, starting with a tweet,Trump repeatedly suggested that Alabama would be hit by Hurricane Dorian at the time it was deemed Category 5. Just 20 minutes after Trump's initial tweet, the National Weather Service Twitter account for Birmingham, Alabama posted: \"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\" Officials said later they were responding to nervous calls and were unaware of the tweet. For days afterward, Trump falsely insisted he was correct. He marked up a map with a sharpie to indicate Alabama was in the path -- and then pushed officials to repudiate the NWS tweet from Alabama.
