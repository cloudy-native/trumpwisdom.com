We have stopped the previous Caravans, and we will stop these also. With a Wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive. Being Built!”","analysis":"More active-duty troops are being deployed to the border, but they are not detaining migrants. They are mostly putting up concertina wire and providing support services to immigration officials. The wall is not being built, and since it would have to be built a mile or so inland from the border, many of the people currently journeying from Central America to seek asylum in the U.S. would still be able to use the same process. U.S. law requires them to be in the United States to request asylum, so they could still file valid claims by crossing the border even if they did not make it past Trump's wall.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"29853, 27893, 27632, 27322, 25463, 25353, 22852, 22719, 14874, 14649, 13693, 10584, 9908, 9950, 9767, 9773, 9449, 9273, 9262, 9042, 8970, 8934, 8823, 8772, 8781, 8699, 8550, 8563, 8587, 8406, 8481, 8485, 8503, 8355, 8367, 8511, 8514, 8288, 8289, 8268, 8278, 8260, 8057, 7780, 7783, 8152, 8157, 8190, 8206, 8231, 8241, 8251, 8257, 8096, 8103, 8243, 7768, 8245, 8220, 7877, 7878, 7883, 7885, 7899, 7909, 7948, 7845, 7846, 7864","repeated_count":"69","date":"01/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
