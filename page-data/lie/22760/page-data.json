But this mail-in voting where they mail, indiscriminately, millions and millions of ballots to people, you're never going to know who won the election. You can't have that.”","analysis":"A distinction without a difference. “Absentee ballots” and “mail-in ballots” are interchangeable terms. State officials use safeguards such as bar codes and signature matching to ensure the authenticity of all ballots cast by mail. For the purposes of ballot verification, it makes no difference whether someone mailed an absentee ballot or dropped it off in person. It doesn't matter whether a voter had an excuse to vote by mail, such as military service, or not. All voters must identify themselves to register to vote and then submit ballots to local officials for verification. Safety measures to verify their authenticity include signature verification, barcode scanning and in some states, a sworn affidavit signed by a witness.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"24495, 24318, 24141, 24048, 23896, 23008, 23032, 22760, 22763, 22865, 22732, 22564","repeated_count":"12","date":"08/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
