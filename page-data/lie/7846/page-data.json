Any wall would be built a mile or so inland from the border. Many of those attempting to immigrate are Central Americans seeking asylum. To petition for asylum, a person needs to be on U.S. soil under current law. So in theory, immigrants could cross the border and file a legally valid petition for asylum before reaching Trump's wall. The incentive would still exist.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"29853, 27893, 27632, 27322, 25463, 25353, 22852, 22719, 14874, 14649, 13693, 10584, 9908, 9950, 9767, 9773, 9449, 9273, 9262, 9042, 8970, 8934, 8823, 8772, 8781, 8699, 8550, 8563, 8587, 8406, 8481, 8485, 8503, 8355, 8367, 8511, 8514, 8288, 8289, 8268, 8278, 8260, 8057, 7780, 7783, 8152, 8157, 8190, 8206, 8231, 8241, 8251, 8257, 8096, 8103, 8243, 7768, 8245, 8220, 7877, 7878, 7883, 7885, 7899, 7909, 7948, 7845, 7846, 7864","repeated_count":"69","date":"12/31/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
