Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would eliminate private insurance but not all Democratic candidates or lawmakers support such an idea. Plus, while the plan would eliminate private plans, it would create a national health insurance. (The Census Bureau <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-264.pdf#page=10\">says</a> that in 2017, 217 million Americans had private insurance, with 181 million covered through an employer and 52 million directly purchasing it. Meanwhile, 123 million Americans are covered already through a government plan, such as Medicare, Medicaid or the military health system.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
