They have so much time to do this thing. Oh, let them put their votes in and give them plenty of time. You know, we have a date. It's called November 3rd. We don't have a date that says many days later we don't have a date that says you're allowed to go and start putting your vote in later and we can tabulate it later. ... And there's great danger in that. No. One, there's danger that there's a lot of shenanigans that go on from that time forth. There's a lot of shenanigans and then there's a lot of bad things that can happen.”","analysis":"There is no legal requirement that mandates the immediate reporting of all election results in the country; delayed counting is unavoidable when so many people are avoiding election lines during the pandemic. Plenty of presidential elections have remained unsettled on election night, some for days or weeks. Trump baselessly suggests Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, will manipulate the vote count, laying the groundwork for his many unsuccessful challenges to contest his loss in the state.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
