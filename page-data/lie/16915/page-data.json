But his approval rating in the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/\">blended poll rating</a> of FiveThirtyEight was well short of 53 percent. Rather, 43.4 percent approved of his performance, compared to disapproval of more than 52 percent. \n","pinocchios":"4","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"27050, 25623, 25135, 24145, 21528, 22978, 21382, 22629, 22578, 20902, 20632, 20471, 20531, 19993, 19985, 20140, 20128, 19856, 19745, 18924, 18961, 19695, 18914, 18896, 18931, 18677, 18507, 18511, 17115, 18370, 16915, 18228, 16697, 16408, 16138, 16168, 16059, 16245, 15864, 15922, 15018, 14491, 15796, 15773, 14756, 14747, 15758, 15650, 14150, 14321, 14157, 15483, 14314, 14071, 15161, 14269, 14216, 13937, 13495, 13477, 13381, 12716, 12774, 12617, 12916, 12512, 12353, 12036, 10821, 10822, 9178, 8813, 8532, 7949, 6694, 6301, 4639, 4649, 4496, 4235, 3899, 3652, 3648","repeated_count":"83","date":"02/04/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
