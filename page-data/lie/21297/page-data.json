The last administration tied America up in one globalist debacle after another. They catered to the special interests while allowing foreign nations to siphon off our wealth, our dignity, our dreams, our money. The suffering of our workers was met with nothing but cruel betrayal and callous indifference....they were perfectly happy to let China win, your jobs disappear, and your factory to close.”","analysis":"Trump, speaking at a Whirlpool factory, is wrong to claim the Obama administration did nothing and were \"perfectly happy\" to let jobs disappear, The Commerce Department imposed taxes on Samsung and LG washing machines in 2013 and again in 2015 for its behavior, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/struggling-whirlpool-turns-to-trump-administration-for-protection-from-competitors\">reported The Washington Examiner</a>, and the Obama Administration blasted Samsung and LG for selling at “unfairly” low prices.
