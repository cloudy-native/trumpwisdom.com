Trump, whose White House officials often ask to speak to reporters anonymously, has a well known reputation for being an anonymous source to reporters over the years. News reports on Trump's administration that were initially based on anonymous sources are routinely confirmed as time passes and evidence emerges publicly.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
