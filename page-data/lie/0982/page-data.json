He told stories about his Vietnam battles and....conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie. He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child. Now he judges collusion?”","analysis":"Blumenthal did misrepresent his military service, repeatedly conflating his time in the Marine Reserves in Washington, D.C., with those who served overseas in Vietnam, and later apologized. But there is no evidence he ever bragged about conquests or battles or that he cried when his misleading statements became public.
