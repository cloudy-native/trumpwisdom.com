But it's not clear which city in California he was talking about or whether it was a sanctuary jurisdiction at the time of these events. Information provided by the White House does not indicate that this individual was wanted by ICE at the time of his battery or domestic violence offenses in 2004 or 2017. ICE ultimately arrested this person anyway.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/10/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
