When you see children getting sick, they get sick on the trail up. Very sick.”","analysis":"This doesn't track with reality. Any wall would be built a mile or so inland from the border. Many of those attempting to immigrate are Central Americans seeking asylum. To petition for asylum, a person needs to be on U.S. soil under current law. So in theory, immigrants could cross the border and file a legally valid petition for asylum before reaching Trump's wall. The incentive would still exist. It's also important to keep in mind that most illegal immigration is the result of visa overstays. A wall would make no difference in those cases. The World Health Organization says there’s more risk of disease spreading from business travelers or tourists than migrants. Anyone seeking asylum in the United States undergoes a medical screening and examination to identify inadmissible health conditions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"29853, 27893, 27632, 27322, 25463, 25353, 22852, 22719, 14874, 14649, 13693, 10584, 9908, 9950, 9767, 9773, 9449, 9273, 9262, 9042, 8970, 8934, 8823, 8772, 8781, 8699, 8550, 8563, 8587, 8406, 8481, 8485, 8503, 8355, 8367, 8511, 8514, 8288, 8289, 8268, 8278, 8260, 8057, 7780, 7783, 8152, 8157, 8190, 8206, 8231, 8241, 8251, 8257, 8096, 8103, 8243, 7768, 8245, 8220, 7877, 7878, 7883, 7885, 7899, 7909, 7948, 7845, 7846, 7864","repeated_count":"69","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
