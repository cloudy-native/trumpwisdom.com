He & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!”","analysis":"This is false. McCain only learned of the existence of the dossier at a conference in Halifax, Canada on Nov. 18 -- after the election -- from Andrew Wood, who had seen the documents written by Christopher Steele, a former British spy. McCain then in late November dispatched David J. Kramer, a senior director of the McCain Institute, to London to meet with Steele. Kramer returned to the U.S. with a copy of the dossier and gave it to McCain, who then gave it to the FBI. (The FBI already had a copy.) Kramer has testified that he gave the material to reporters in December, including BuzzFeed, which published it in January. But there is no evidence that McCain gave the material to reporters. McCain was not \"last in his class\" at Annapolis but he certainly was near the bottom -- 894th out of 899 students.
