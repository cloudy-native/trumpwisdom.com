And if you take a look and you see, like we do, through certain technology -- including cameras and airplanes, not just drones -- you'll see vast numbers of vehicles driving through the desert and entering where you don't have a very powerful fence or a wall. That happened this week, where a wonderful, young police officer -- I spoke to his wife yesterday -- where he was shot, viciously shot, for simply stopping a person that came over the border illegally.”","analysis":"There's no evidence of \"vast numbers\" of vehicles crossing undetected in areas without border barriers. Authorities say a Mexican immigrant who was in the United States illegally killed a police officer in California. But there's no information about how or when he crossed the border. ICE said after the arrest that immigration officials had not come into contact with the suspect, Gustavo Perez Arriaga a/k/a Paulo Virgen Mendoza.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8821, 8567, 8592, 8487, 8487, 8495, 8504, 8505, 8382, 8292, 8274, 7803, 8010, 8007, 8130, 7794, 8189, 8202, 8229, 8246, 8246, 8250, 7762, 7762, 8004, 8077, 8092, 7970, 7971, 7979, 7980, 7999, 8209, 8219, 7960, 7880, 7861","repeated_count":"37","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
