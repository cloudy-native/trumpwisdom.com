When Polls open, go to your Polling Place to see if it was COUNTED. IF NOT, VOTE! Your signed Ballot will not count because your vote has been posted. Don't let them illegally take your vote away from you!”","analysis":"Trump told North Carolina voters to vote twice. That's illegal in the state. Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article245509345.html\">said</a> that voting twice in an election, attempting to vote twice or soliciting someone to do so is a violation of North Carolina law. North Carolina has three ways to track your absentee by-mail ballot: checking the state’s website, signing up for BallotTrax, which is set to launch in a few days, or by contacting your county board of elections. “The State Board office strongly discourages people from showing up at the polls on Election Day to check whether their absentee ballot was counted. That is not necessary, and it would lead to longer lines and the possibility of spreading COVID-19,” Brinson Bell wrote in a message.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
