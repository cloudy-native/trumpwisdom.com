Can you imagine? If they walked out with one and a half billion dollars, they wouldn't be saying totally unsubstantiated. They'd be saying, ‘Where's the nearest cell? This is a horrible thing.’ So it's a disgrace what's going on. It's a whole big fat disgrace and it's very unfair to Republicans.”","analysis":"This is brazen even for Trump. He is comparing his children to Hunter Biden, but it's false to claim Biden \"walked out\" of China with $1.5 billion. Meanwhile, Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka Trump have continued to profit from the Trump name and business after their father took office, raising a series of ethical and constitutional questions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
