The American people should demand NAMES!”","analysis":"The White House, the State Department and the Pentagon often provide background briefings to reporters on condition that the names of officials not be disclosed. Trump himself famously has been an unidentified source for reporters. He even tweeted about information he's received from unidentified sources. When Trump doesn't like what's being reported, he calls it fake news. But in almost every case, the reports are proven to be accurate and the substance of Trump's complaint is that the facts reflect poorly on him. Reputable news organizations follow ethical rules and correct mistakes promptly, something Trump knows since he often celebrates these corrections on Twitter. Reporters at reputable news organizations do not make up sources; it is a firing offense.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
