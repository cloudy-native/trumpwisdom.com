This is a decision by a judge who is highly respected -- who was appointed by Bill Clinton when he was President -- and he came out and he said, 'It's a hoax.'

U.S. District Judge John Koeltl  rejected the central theory of the racketeering suit by the Democratic National Committee: that the Trump campaign, campaign aides and Trump allies abetted the theft of the emails from the DNC by encouraging WikiLeaks to publish the messages and by urging they be released when they would be of maximum political benefit to then-candidate Trump. Koelti said such actions were protected by the First Amendment when taken by people not involved in the actual hacking.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
