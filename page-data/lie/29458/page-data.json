They count three in Michigan, one in Alabama and one in Texas. Investment in auto manufacturing was higher under the last three years of Barack Obama’s presidency than the first three of Trump’s.  There’s no evidence that Trump’s threat of tariffs led to more auto investment.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"29458, 29084, 28648, 27958, 26872, 27351, 26380, 26314, 25448, 25199, 24751, 24288, 24093, 23413","repeated_count":"14","date":"11/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
