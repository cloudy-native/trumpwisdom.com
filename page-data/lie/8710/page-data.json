And on a nuclear way over the last 20, 30 years and all I hear is, \"Can't you move faster?\" You know what? I left Singapore 15 months ago, they've been negotiating for 85 years or something. So now their complaint is, \"What's taking him so long?\" I heard one of our great geniuses from a previous administration telling me how to negotiate with North Korea when they got taken advantage of like nobody I've ever seen before.”","analysis":"North Korea has only existed since 1948, so it's puzzling why Trump says negotiations have taken place for 85 years.  The Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations did try to deal with the North Korean issue. Clinton struck a deal, which Bush abandoned but then tried to negotiate a new one. Obama did not want to launch talks by making new concessions, as Bush did, so progress stalled. There are virtually no experts who ask why Trump is not moving faster. Instead, many say Trump is moving too fast, giving the North Korean dictator many concessions without receiving concrete results in turn.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"9159, 9004, 8710, 8352, 8294, 6297, 5328, 5531, 5720, 5157, 4592, 4367, 4302, 4033, 3971, 3924, 16809, 3367, 3305, 3298, 3301, 2949, 2905, 2805, 2632, 2802, 2550, 2489, 2491, 2301, 2075, 2111, 1984, 1955, 1893, 1333, 1317, 1317, 1286, 1286, 1268, 0996, 0580, 0495","repeated_count":"44","date":"02/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
