If I wanted to fire Mueller, I would have done it myself. It's very simple. I had the right to. And frankly, whether I did or he did, we had the absolute right to fire Mueller.... Legally, I had absolute right to fire, but I never told Don McGahn to fire Mueller.”","analysis":"Investigators interviewed eight Trump aides and friends under oath and documented the series of events that led McGhan to conclude he needed to resign because Trump had ordered him to fire Mueller. “McGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House,” the report concluded. “McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the President's request.” Trump declined to be interviewed by the prosecutors. The report adds: “The President’s subsequent denials that he had told McGahn to have the special counsel removed were carefully worded....The President’s assertion in the Oval Office meeting that he had never directed McGahn to have the special counsel removed thus runs counter to the evidence.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
