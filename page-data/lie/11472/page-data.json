The Justice Department's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2018/i-2018-003523.pdf\">Inspector General investigation on the recovery of text messages</a> from Strzok and Page's devices did not determine that any crime had been committed, nor did it mention that Mueller was in any way involved in the loss of any exchanges between them. The IG was unable to review any communications between Strzok and Page on the iPhones they were assigned during their time working for the special counsel's office because the phones were returned to their factory settings when they were returned. (This was done as a matter of routine.) Texts between Strzok and Page between Dec. 15, 2017 and May 17, 2017, were lost because of a glitch in the FBI's data collection system, but the IG was able to recover about 10,000 texts from each their devices. The report said there was no evidence that Strzok and Page had \"attempted to circumvent the FBI's text message collection capabilities.\" ","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
