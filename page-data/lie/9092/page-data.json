He got there four hours early. He took pictures of an empty arena. He then put out a note, something to the effect, ‘Not very good crowd size, Mr. President.’ And I never saw it because I don't follow the guy. But thousands of people that were in that arena that was packed with 25,000 people outside that couldn't get in. He got there four or five hours early, because he doesn't fly private. … Nobody was in the arena. There were thousands outside but they hadn't opened the gates yet.”","analysis":"Trump is making a mountain out of a tweet. Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel tweeted a photo of a nearly empty arena, but he quickly deleted it after he was informed it was from hours earlier. He never wrote an article as Trump claims. Weigel responded minutes after a tweet from Trump, who said he had \"put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before I arrived.\" Weigel said he took the tweet down after Daily Mail political editor David Martosko told him he had gotten it wrong.  \"Sure thing: I apologize. I deleted the photo after @dmartosko told me I'd gotten it wrong. Was confused by the image of you walking in the bottom right corner,\" he tweeted. Trump later called on Weigel to be fired, even though it appeared to be an innocent mistake. Weigel still works for The Post.
