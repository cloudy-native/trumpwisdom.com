All along, they've been supporting walls and supporting fences and supporting all sorts of border security. The fact is they've always supported fences and walls and partitions, but you know what?

It passed 283-138 in the House, with 64 Democrat votes, and 80-19 in the Senate, with 26 Democrat votes. But the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself has called the 2006 fence a \"nothing wall.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31482, 24398, 20407, 16846, 16087, 14949, 15579, 14266, 14609, 13946, 13862, 13709, 12022, 11920, 11784, 9587, 9239, 8643, 8479, 8483, 8282, 7811, 8013, 8095, 8104, 7771, 8090, 8221, 7863, 7699, 7685, 7594, 7431, 7536, 7446","repeated_count":"35","date":"12/13/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
