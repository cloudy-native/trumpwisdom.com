And I know that there are other things, obviously.”","analysis":"Trump claims Mueller has several conflicts of interest in the Russia investigation. The president interviewed Mueller for the FBI director position after firing Comey, which Trump says now poses a conflict. Trump says Mueller resigned his membership at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va., in 2011 because of a disagreement over fees. The president believes Mueller still holds a grudge against him over the matter. Mueller, who was FBI director at the time of the alleged dispute, denied the incident and any potential hard feelings. “Mr. Mueller left the club in October 2011 without dispute,” a spokesman for Mueller said. Both Mueller and former FBI director Comey have denied they are \"best friends\" or even have a close personal relationship. They have described themselves as former colleagues in the Department of Justice with long, overlapping careers that intersected at the highest levels.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
