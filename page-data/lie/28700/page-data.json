The Democrat party wants you to be banned from peaceful assembly, while they allow their supporters to burn down a police precinct, right here. Biden and the far left incite violence with their vile anti-Police rhetoric, and the fact that they're weak people -- very, very weak people. They allow rioters to lay waste to the public streets that financed, and they were financed by you with your hard-earned taxpayer dollars. The radical left is determined to obliterate the middle class.”","analysis":"This is ridiculous over-the-top rhetoric, a smear on hyperdrive.
