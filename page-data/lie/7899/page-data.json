But the areas that are built, nobody is getting through. You can't get through, unless you're a world-class pole-vaulter in the Olympic team. It's very hard to get through. Very few people are able to get through.”","analysis":"Apprehensions along the southern border have been declining for two decades -- in areas with barriers and in areas without them. The Olympic record for men's pole vaulting was set in 2014 by France's Renaud Lavillenie at 20 feet and 2 1/2 inches. Trump's proposed border wall would rise 35 to 40 feet from the ground, so Lavillenie's majestic arc would have come up far short. Also, it's well known that drug cartels and others dig tunnels to get into the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"29853, 27893, 27632, 27322, 25463, 25353, 22852, 22719, 14874, 14649, 13693, 10584, 9908, 9950, 9767, 9773, 9449, 9273, 9262, 9042, 8970, 8934, 8823, 8772, 8781, 8699, 8550, 8563, 8587, 8406, 8481, 8485, 8503, 8355, 8367, 8511, 8514, 8288, 8289, 8268, 8278, 8260, 8057, 7780, 7783, 8152, 8157, 8190, 8206, 8231, 8241, 8251, 8257, 8096, 8103, 8243, 7768, 8245, 8220, 7877, 7878, 7883, 7885, 7899, 7909, 7948, 7845, 7846, 7864","repeated_count":"69","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
