But a person was on a plane, said that there were about six people like that person, more or less. And what happened is the entire plane filled up with the looters, the anarchists, the rioters -- people that obviously were looking for trouble. And the person felt very uncomfortable on the plane. This would be a person you know. So I will see whether or not I can get that person. I'll let them know, and I'll see whether or not I can get that person to speak to you. But this was a firsthand account of a plane going from Washington to wherever.”","analysis":"There is no evidence of any such flight, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/trumps-plane-loaded-thugs-rumor-123200002.html\">according to news reports</a>. Trump's account, however, matches a viral Facebook conspiracy theory from June claiming a group of anarchists flew from Seattle to Boise to cause trouble. That rumor circulated enough that the Payette County Sheriff's Office was forced to issue a statement clarifying that the Facebook post contained \"false information.\"\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
