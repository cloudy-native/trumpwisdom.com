Likewise, the @nytimes and @washingtonpost are a disgrace to journalism. They are all Fake News, and they know it better than anyone else. History is unfolding, and it is not a pretty picture for 'journalism'”.","analysis":"\"Obamagate\" is Trump's catch-all term for alleged crimes that even he cannot explain when he was questioned about it. Watergate was a constitutional crisis that led to the resignation of a president. The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN and MSNBC may make mistakes from time to time -- which they correct -- but they are not fake news.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
