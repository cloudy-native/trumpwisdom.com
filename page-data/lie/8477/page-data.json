But <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/12/13/the-pre-war-intelligence-on-iraq-wrong-or-hyped-by-the-bush-white-house/?utm_term=.002ba106b706\">he gets the history wrong</a>. First of all, U.S. intelligence did not say Iraq had nuclear weapons, but there were signs that it might be trying to reconstitute its nuclear program. U.S. intelligence also assessed that Iraq possibly possessed chemical or biological weapons, but policymakers did not reveal that there were large gaps in knowledge about whether Iraq kept producing such weapons. After the invasion, no evidence was found. But more to the point, the intelligence failure shows what happens when policymakers pressure the Intelligence Community to come up with evidence that supports policy objectives, rather than using intelligence to inform policy choices.
