Absolutely nothing on north Korea. It allowed things that happened and to happen that were very inappropriate.”","analysis":"After the failure of the Bush’s administration’s frantic efforts to reach a deal with North Korea, former President Barack Obama adopted the policy of gradually escalating sanctions on North Korea while refusing to negotiate with Pyongyang until it gave up its nuclear weapons program in what came to be known as “strategic patience.” The Obama administration in 2012 reached a short-lived agreement with North Korea to suspend its nuclear weapons tests and uranium enrichment and allow international inspectors to monitor activities at its main nuclear complex. To some extent, despite the high profile summits, Trump is adopting the same policy of patience as long as Pyongyang does not make provocative moves, such as missile or nuclear tests.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
