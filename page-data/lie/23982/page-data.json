This is shot. Somebody said, you mean with bullets? I said, yeah, with bullets, 18 people died. Now, we're pulling our troops out of Afghanistan, out of Iraq, you see what's happening. But, but let me tell you, but we don't -- there's nothing like that over there. They don't have 18 people killed or 12 people, you know, in a short period of time, where you have 70 people shot, where you have another weekend where they had, I think a few weekends ago, 38 people have been shot in Chicago.”","analysis":"Trump often makes a flawed apples-to-oranges comparison. in which he says the murder rates of certain U.S. cities is higher than Afghanistan or troubled Latin American countries like Honduras. Comparing Afghanistan's murder rate with those of U.S. cities tells you nothing about crime or public safety -- because Afghanistan has been a warzone for many years. War deaths are not counted in crime rates. Moreover, Baltimore of Chicago are cities, and Trump is comparing an urban area to countries with a mix of urban and rural areas. It would be more relevant compare the state of Maryland to these countries -- and Maryland's murder rate is far lower than these countries.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"23982","repeated_count":"1","date":"09/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
