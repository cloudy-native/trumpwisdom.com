The level of debt fluctuates day to day and week to week, depending on seasonal changes in growth and when the government makes payments, collects tax revenue, issues new debt and other debt matures — making the data very susceptible to cherry-picking. Using the same logic, you could claim that after four days in office Trump increased outstanding public debt by more than $10 billion, and that Obama had reduced it by $6 billion.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/25/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
