European Union is worse to us on trade than China, okay? Nobody would think that.”","analysis":"The actual trade deficit with the European Union is about $100 billion, not $150 billion, because the U.S. has a services surplus of about $50 billion. (The trade deficit with the EU was $115 billion in 2018, $101 billion in 2017, $93 billion in 2016.) Trump's focus on the trade deficit is misplaced, as the United States and the EU have total trade in goods of more than $700 billion, with U.S. exports to the EU in 2015 supporting more than 2.6 million U.S. jobs, according to the Census Bureau.
