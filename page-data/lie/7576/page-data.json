A 2018 study published in the peer-reviewed journal Criminology, led by Michael Light, a criminologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, examined whether places with higher percentages of undocumented immigrants have higher rates of violent crime such as murder or rape. The answer: States with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tended to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares in the years 1990 through 2014. Similar results were found in another peer-reviewed study by the same researchers that looked at nonviolent crime, such as drug arrests and driving under the influence (DUI) arrests. Similarly, the libertarian Cato Institute in 2018 looked at 2015 criminal conviction data among undocumented immigrants in Texas — one of the few states to record whether a person who has been arrested is in the country illegally or not. Researcher Alex Nowrasteh found that criminal conviction and arrest rates in Texas for undocumented immigrants were lower than those of native-born Americans for homicide, sexual assault and larceny.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"20892, 20384, 20385, 20327, 18406, 17393, 18294, 16717, 16084, 16308, 16341, 15833, 14946, 15697, 15546, 15550, 15574, 15470, 15519, 15196, 13247, 13715, 12433, 11638, 12258, 11650, 11543, 12087, 12102, 11963, 11504, 11507, 11877, 11851, 11763, 11752, 11031, 11720, 11727, 11734, 10806, 10802, 10792, 10583, 10678, 10260, 10005, 9857, 9647, 9547, 9315, 9320, 9251, 9137, 8941, 8778, 8695, 8756, 8362, 8354, 8384, 8277, 8005, 8153, 8154, 7765, 8072, 7731, 7698, 7649, 7553, 7576, 1809, 1677","repeated_count":"74","date":"12/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
