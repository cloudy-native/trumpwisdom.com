Why isn't Germany and France and U.K. and all these other countries in Europe that are much more affected than us, why aren't they paying something?

Europe has been a major funder to Ukraine since Russia annexed its Crimean Peninsula in 2014, often providing more aid than the United States. The European Union has provided more than 15 billion euros ($16.5 billion) in grants and loans to Ukraine, according to an E.U. fact sheet on relations with Ukraine. Meanwhile, NATO has its own military cooperation program with Ukraine, establishing six trust funds to assist the country in improving its military readiness. The United States provided $1.3 billion to Ukraine since late 2013, according to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"16922, 16768, 16790, 16589, 16037, 15942, 16233, 14760, 14799, 14801, 13814, 14847, 14328, 15730, 15262, 14250, 12960, 12894, 13176, 13181, 13371, 12832, 12848, 12971","repeated_count":"24","date":"01/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
