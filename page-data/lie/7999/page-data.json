And a lot of these people that really do benefit are not only the people in our country, but the people that travel up trying to get into a country that they think they're going to get into and they can't. And they get sick, and there's tremendous damage done to them and their families.”","analysis":"Women and children face hazardous conditions on the journey from Central America to the U.S. border, and there have been two recent deaths of young immigrant children in U.S. custody. However, Trump's language about sickness spreading and \"tremendous damage\" does not reflect conditions on the ground. It's also important to keep in mind that many immigrants are families fleeing violence in Central America or seeking economic opportunity in the United States and would rather risk the journey than stay in their home countries.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8821, 8567, 8592, 8487, 8487, 8495, 8504, 8505, 8382, 8292, 8274, 7803, 8010, 8007, 8130, 7794, 8189, 8202, 8229, 8246, 8246, 8250, 7762, 7762, 8004, 8077, 8092, 7970, 7971, 7979, 7980, 7999, 8209, 8219, 7960, 7880, 7861","repeated_count":"37","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
