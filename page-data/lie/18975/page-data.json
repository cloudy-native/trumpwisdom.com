Tonight they put on yet another Fake 'Whistleblower', a disgruntled employee who supports Dems, fabricates stories, & spews lies. @60Minutes report was incorrect, which they couldn't care less about. Fake News! I don't know this guy, never met him, but don't like what I see. How can a creep like this show up to work tomorrow & report to @SecAzar, his boss, after trashing him on T.V.? This whole Whistleblower racket needs to be looked at very closely, it is causing great injustice & harm. I hope you are listening @SenSusanCollins I also hope that Shari Redstone will take a look at her poorly performing gang. She knows how to make things right!”","analysis":"There is no reason to believe <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/politics/rick-bright-coronavirus-whistleblower.html\">Rick Bright</a>, who previously led the division of the Department of Health and Human Services focused on developing therapeutics for viruses including covid-19, is a “fake whistleblower.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
