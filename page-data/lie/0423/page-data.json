But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand. ... As an example, Ford, General Motors. I've had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma (chairman of Alibaba Group), he comes up, he says, “Only because of you am I making this massive investment.” Intel, only because of you. ... The press never writes that.","analysis":"Trump exaggerates the number of jobs created since he became president; the number of net new jobs since January 2017 is 317,000. Trump also continues to claim undue credit for corporate decisions that were made before he was elected president. Ford’s decision to expand in Michigan rather than in Mexico had more to do with the company’s long-term goals than with the administration. General Motors announced jobs plans in January and March 2017, but the company did not credit Trump or his election. Intel announced it would create at least 10,000 jobs at a “new” plant in Arizona but the investment was announced in 2011. Chinese e-company Alibaba's founder Jack Ma has been pitching his company as a U.S. job creator since as early as 2015.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"9069, 6869, 6970, 4444, 4445, 4544, 3803, 3796, 4139, 3819, 3834, 2994, 2832, 2846, 2616, 2403, 2396, 2443, 2415, 2416, 2417, 2418, 2419, 2422, 2311, 2268, 2079, 1810, 1756, 1838, 1750, 1701, 1657, 1630, 1565, 1618, 1422, 1445, 1328, 1304, 1293, 1143, 1128, 1145, 1094, 1084, 1054, 1000, 0992, 0995, 1021, 0974, 0989, 1028, 0998, 0930, 0942, 0686, 0663, 0585, 0565, 0541, 0475, 0423, 0384, 0373, 0347, 0366, 0340, 0337, 0325, 0330, 0320, 0322, 0315, 0293, 0260, 0234, 0227, 0167, 0178, 0152, 0114, 0070, 0089, 0127, 0059","repeated_count":"87","date":"04/21/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
