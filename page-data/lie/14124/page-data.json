But they ran their businesses. George Washington, they say, had two desks: He had a presidential desk and a business desk.”","analysis":"We will leave it to readers to decide if the practices at the nation’s founding are relevant today. Washington was one of the nation’s largest landowners when he became president, though they were of dubious value, and he was a shareholder in the Patowmack Co., which aimed to build canals that would have given his land more value. Some historians have been critical — one wrote that Washington “betrayed private trusts in pursuit of private gain” — but our colleague Joel Achenbach, in his 2005 book, “The Grand Idea: George Washington’s Potomac and the Race to the West,” concluded: “There is remarkably little tarnish to be mined in the Washington archive. We can be confident that his reputation as an honest man is not the product of a historical whitewash.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
