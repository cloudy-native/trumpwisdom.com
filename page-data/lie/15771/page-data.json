My assessment of the evidence so far, NO WHERE CLOSE. The evidence is conflicting & ambiguous. Ambassador Sondland’s testimony stated that President Trump said the Ukraine President should just do the right thing (No Quid Pro Quo). You shouldn’t charge, but you cannot convict, a sitting president on the basis of conflicting and ambiguous evidence, and destabilize the American Government.' Thank you Ken!","analysis":"Trump significantly changed the meaning of Starr's quote and added in something he did not say. Starr acknowledges that Sondland did say there was quid pro quo. Here's Starr's actual quote: \"Does this reach the level of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors? My assessment of the evidence thus far: nowhere close. The evidence is conflicting and ambiguous. I think Ambassador Sondland's testimony yesterday was a clear indication of, gosh where are we at the end of the day. Clearly in his opening statement, a quid pro quo. And then he says later, 'Well the President said, \"I don't want anything, right, President Zelensky should just do the right thing.\"' That's the words from the president himself. So the record at the end of the day is likely to be ambiguous at best, conflicting at best.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"15988, 15952, 14597, 14926, 14746, 15771, 14710, 14736, 14739, 14504, 15293, 15159","repeated_count":"12","date":"11/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
