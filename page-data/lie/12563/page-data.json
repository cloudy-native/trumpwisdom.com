They are a wealthy country and should be at 2%. We protect Europe and yet, only 8 of the 28 NATO countries are at the 2% mark. The United States is at a much, much higher level than that.”","analysis":"This is misleading and wrong in several ways. The United States contributes to NATO to protect its own national security and economic interests. NATO contributions from member nations do not go into a bank account somewhere; it's actually what each country spends on its own defense as a percentage of GDP. The United States has defense priorities and interests around the globe and not just in Western Europe, so it's not a meaningful comparison Trump makes. Furthermore, Denmark, like all NATO member nations since 2014, has committed to a gradual increase in its defense budget until reaching a 2 percent target. For its 2023 budget agreement, Denmark is spending 1.5 percent of GDP on defense. Former Danish prime minister Lars Rasmussen responded to Trump's tweet by noting that Danish casualties in Afghanistan had been proportional to those of the United States. \"And - as i told You at the NATO Summit in Brussels last year - we have had (proportionally) exactly the same numbers of casualties in Afghanistan as US. We always stands firm and ready - so we will not accept that our defence willingness is only about percentages,\" Rasmussen tweeted.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
