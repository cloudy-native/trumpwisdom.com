And it has reduced the trade deficit.”","analysis":"This statement is poppycock. Trump is referring to a one month decline in the trade deficit from October to November – but then it hit a record in December. (A better measure would be to compare November 2018 to November 2017. That shows the trade deficit increased year over year.) We’d previously estimated that the Trump tariffs brought in about $3 billion in November (and a roughly equivalent amount in December). But that pales in comparison to monthly deficits of $70 billion to $80 billion. Moreover, the tariffs would affect the deficit only by decreasing imports, not by reducing the trade-deficit figure. And imports have kept increasing. For the year, trade deficits in 2018 are expected to exceed 2017 – and be the highest since 2008.
