Now we got it built. I was signing a sheet of paper, you've heard this story, $1.1 billion. I said, 'What's this for?' they said, 'Sir, we're going to, with now that you've moved, we're going to build an embassy in Israel, in Jerusalem.' I say, 'How much is it?', '1.1 billion.' I think I got some friends of mine here, they're builders, you don't spend 1.1 billion on a one-story -- I don't know what's going on. So I said, 'So, does it have to cost so much?', 'Yes, sir. We're buying land.' so I called David Friedman, he's our ambassador who's one of the most successful lawyers in New York, he's a brilliant guy. He loves Israel, right, loves Israel. I call him, his ambassador, he's there, I said, 'David, I want to spend 1.1 billion on a damn one-story embassy.' it's crazy, I said, 'Would you take a look? Maybe we own some land.' you know, we own a lot of land. We've been there a long time. He calls me back, he said, 'Let me take a look at it, sir.' he calls me back the next day, 'Sir, we have a great piece of land, a much better location that we will get away overpay for, a much bigger piece. We have a setback building that we can renovate and make it great.' I said, 'That's fantastic, David. How much will it cost to renovate the building?', 'I think we could do it for $190,000.' So I said, David, the first time I've ever done. I said, 'David, it's too cheap. You got to spend more than that.'...So I think we ended up spending to fix up the building like $500,000. Can you believe?”","analysis":"The new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem for about $400,000. (Trump sometimes claims it cost $500,000.) U.S. government documents <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/67072609\">show</a> the overall cost for the conversion now totals more than $23 million. Costs for the permanent embassy could well surpass $1 billion when all is said and done.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"09/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
