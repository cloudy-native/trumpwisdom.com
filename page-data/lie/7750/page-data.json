I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version!”","analysis":"In trying to make the case for a high concrete border wall, Trump exaggerates about the Obama house in Washington, D.C. It is an 8,200 square foot Tudor-style home in the Kalorama residential area, but it is not a \"compound.\" The Obamas added security fencing to an enlarged retaining wall in front for the needs of the Secret Service but there is not a ten-foot wall around the house; the front steps are open to the sidewalk. Chain link fencing, but no wall, was added to the back. While Trump says the border wall would be a \"slightly larger version\" of the alleged Obama wall, he has previously described his proposed wall as 1,000 miles long, made of precast concrete slabs, rising 35 to 40 feet in the air.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/30/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
