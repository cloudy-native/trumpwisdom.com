That is highly misleading. The 300 figure represents a tiny fraction of all resettled refugees in the United States per year (83,380 on average), and since the refugee program began in 1980 (3 million). Since Sept. 11, 2001, roughly 190,000 refugees were accepted into the United States from the six countries listed in the immigration executive order. The 300 figure represents a fraction — though it is unclear how small or big — of the total open counterterrorism investigations (which could be 1,000 or up to 10,000). And we have no idea what charges are involved, or if these investigations will even result in any charges (or convictions, for that matter).","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/06/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
