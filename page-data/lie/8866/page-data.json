That was an incredible event. In fact, when we were campaigning, so many people would say -- even though it was many years ago, they would say, \"Is it possible to get the remains back from North Korea?”","analysis":"We remain dubious that Trump had such conversations during the campaign with \"so many people.\" He's often suggested he had conversations with parents of Korean war dead, but a parent of a son served in the Korean war would likely be above the age of 100. Assuming that the average age of the mothers of service members born in 1934 was between 20 and 29, then, gives us a birth year of 1905 to 1914, or between 102 and 111 years old during the 2016 election.
