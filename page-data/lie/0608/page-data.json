So, we can’t build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.”","analysis":"This is false. The agreement is nonbinding and each nation sets its own targets. There is nothing in the agreement that stops the United States from building coal plants or gives the permission to China or India to build coal plants. In fact, market forces, primarily reduced costs for natural gas, have forced the closure of coal plants. China announced this year that it would cancel plans to build more than 100 coal-fired plants.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/01/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
