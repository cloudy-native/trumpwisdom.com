According to records maintained by Russell Wheeler of the Brooking Institution, 70 percent of district judges and 58 percent of appeals court nominees were approved unanimous or by voice vote. Another 11 percent of district nominees and 15 percent of appeals court nominees received fewer than ten nay votes. There were 12 contested appeal-court nominations and Tester voted for all of them. “It’s safe to say that the great majority of Obama’s confirmations had no or negligible opposition, district more so than circuit,” Wheeler said. He added: “Put aside Trump’s throw-away reference to ‘very liberal Obama judges’—the Democratic base complains, as you know, that Obama was less concerned with ideology than demography.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
