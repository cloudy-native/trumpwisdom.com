Remember ‘thumbs down’? We said, ‘What the hell happened?’ He said, two hours before, he was voting to repeal and replace. And then he went thumbs down, badly hurting the Republican Party, badly hurting our nation, and hurting many sick people who desperately wanted good, affordable healthcare. We would've had it. This would've saved our country over a trillion dollars in entitlements, and we would have ended up making a great healthcare plan, frankly, with the Democrats because they would have had no choice.”","analysis":"Trump suggests that Sen. John McCain's vote was the only impediment to passing a repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. But none of the substantive replacement bills got nearly enough votes, and McCain's vote was against a \"skinny\" repeal that was only to lead to talks with the House on a common position, with no guarantee of an agreement that would pass both Houses. McCain had earlier voted for a version of repealing the ACA, but he objected to the skinny repeal because the process went against legislative tradition.
