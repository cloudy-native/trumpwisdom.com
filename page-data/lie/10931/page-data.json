These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results. The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday. 325 Billions Dollars of additional goods sent to us by China remain untaxed, but will be shortly, at a rate of 25%. The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China. The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate.

The study attributed that to the fact the U.S. government \"strategically levied import duties on goods with high import elasticities, which transfers a great share of the tariff burden on to Chinese exporters.\" The study was released in November, using previously released studies from the 1990s, not actual data on prices. But <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/papers/CEPR-DP13564.pdf\">a paper</a> published on March 2 by three prominent U.S. economists found exactly the opposite had happened when actual trade data was studied. \"Overall, using standard economic methods, we find that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018,\" they reported. \"We find that the U.S. tariffs were almost completely passed through into U.S. domestic prices, so that the entire incidence of the tariffs fell on domestic consumers and importers up to now, with no impact so far on the prices received by foreign exporters. We also find that U.S. producers responded to reduced import competition by raising their prices.\" Another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.econ.ucla.edu/pfajgelbaum/RTP.pdf\">paper</a>, published March 3 by a different set of economists, found similar results. \"Tradable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties are the most negatively affected by the trade war,\" the paper said. One of those studies pegged the cost of tariffs announced thus far (including the most recent escalation on $200 billion of Chinese goods) at $831 per U.S. household.
