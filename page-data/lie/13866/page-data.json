I flew to Iraq. I met with the Generals, right? I met with the Generals. I said I hear it's going to take a year to two years. Sir, we could do it in two weeks. I said what? They don't let us fight, sir. They don't let us fight. We want to fight. They don't let us fight.”","analysis":"This claim is ridiculous. First, American forces have been actively engaged in combat efforts in Iraq on and off since 2003. Secondly, Trump only travelled to Iraq after he had been in office for nearly two years  during which he often praised how well U.S. forces were doing in Iraq. It would also mean the “they” he’s referring to is his own administration, which seemingly, would defeat his point.
