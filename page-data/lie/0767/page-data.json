Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?”","analysis":"On Jan. 6, the leadership of the intelligence community --the FBI, National Security Agency, CIA and the Director of National Intelligence -- released a declassified report expressing \"high confidence\" in the CIA's judgement that Russia had meddled in the U.S. election. Senate and House committees led by Republicans have begun their own investigations, and at least one Republican lawmaker has called for the appointment of a special prosecutor. President Obama did confront the Russian president before the election and reportedly told him to 'knock it off.' The Obama administration also took the intelligence to the House and Senate leadership in the hope of bipartisan congressional action.
