We had a great time. We have very good relationships in Europe. I would say our relationships are far better now than under the Obama Administration.”","analysis":"This assessment flies in the face of all evidence. Trump disparaged the British ambassador to the United States, Kim Darroch, to the point that he resigned the post. He harshly criticized former Prime Minister Theresa May over her handling of Brexit, leading the British foreign secretary to call Trump's comments \"disrespectful and wrong.\" May repeatedly scolded Trump over his public comments and according to media reports had a tense relationship with the president in their private conversations. None of this rancor was ever apparent during the Obama administration.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
