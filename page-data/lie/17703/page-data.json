And they have a tremendous capacity....Many operating rooms. You know, they're wartime ships. They're meant for war. Many, many operating rooms.”","analysis":"The dispatch of the medical Navy vessel to New York started out as a disaster. The Comfort was supposed to aid New York — a ship with 1,000 hospital beds, 11 operating rooms, 80 intensive care beds and a radiology suite, staffed by 1,200 crew members — but after more than a week after arriving March 31 it was almost empty, serving only 50 patients.  The Comfort was supposed to take in patients not infected by the coronavirus, so that hospital staff in New York City could focus on the pandemic. But there was also a list of 49 other medical conditions that would exclude a patient from receiving the aid on board the Comfort. Then the Navy on April 8 shifted course, saying the Comfort’s mission has shifted and the ship will now allocate 500 of its 1,000 beds for severe coronavirus cases, even though originally it said the vessel was “not configured to provide treatment for infectious diseases.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28300, 24207, 21089, 20441, 19568, 19578, 19467, 18242, 18086, 17752, 17832, 18579, 18544, 18538, 17703","repeated_count":"15","date":"03/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
