So far, there has been nothing to indicate whether there was a political agenda in Halper's assistance to the FBI, which started after the agency opened a counterintelligence probe. No evidence has surfaced to prove Trump's related claim that President Barack Obama had Trump wiretapped.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
