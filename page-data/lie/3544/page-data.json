I guess they had it prepared from the 13 Angry Democrats leading the Witch Hunt! #StopTheBias”","analysis":"Trump is referring to the team of lawyers that Mueller has assembled. Eleven out of 16 attorneys on Mueller's team made public so far have contributed to Democrats, including Clinton and Obama. The other five have no record of political contributions, though the Daily Caller says 13 are registered Democrats. One attorney who donated the maximum amount represented the Clinton Foundation in a 2015 lawsuit. Another attorney without a record of political donations represented a Clinton aide at one point. Both attorneys worked for WilmerHale, a firm that also represents Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, as well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Moreover, under federal law, Mueller is not allowed to consider the political leanings of his staff when hiring them. Trump suggests that Mueller, a Republican, worked for Obama for 8 years but that's not true; moreover, he was appointed FBI director by George W. Bush.
