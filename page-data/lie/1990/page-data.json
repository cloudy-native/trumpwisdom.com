She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others.”","analysis":"Trump appears to be referring to a Daily Caller article about emails from Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, that were found on the laptop of her then-husband, former representative Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.). The article, based on documents obtained by Judicial Watch, was headlined, “Abedin Forwarded State Passwords To Yahoo Before It Was Hacked By Foreign Agents.” The gist of the article was that Abedin used a Yahoo email account to print out documents and emails that she had forwarded from her unclassified State Department email account. She had explained to the FBI that it was easier to do so than rely on the often-clunky State Department system. In 2013 and 2014, Yahoo accounts were hacked, including by a Russian intelligence agent. One email sent to Yahoo highlighted by the article was dated Aug. 24, 2009, and indicated that an aide sent Abedin a password for access to her computer, as well as a PIN for use of a key fob, which then generates a random password for secure access. Thus it was a two-step process. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said it is unknown whether the laptop or the passwords contained in the email are classified.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
