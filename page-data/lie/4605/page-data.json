Historic dumping. And don’t believe 2 percent by China. It was trans-shipping. You know, everyone’s saying, well, China was only doing 2 percent. No, China was doing 50 percent. What they were doing is they were trans-shipping steel to other countries that didn’t even have steel plants and steel mills. They were sending them to countries that didn’t even deal in steel, and these countries are dumping here because China didn’t want people to know that they’re sending us 50 percent and more.”","analysis":"Two percent is roughly the amount of steel coming directly from China to the US. Industry experts says there probably is some transshipping, but it is more like five percent -- not 50 percent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/30/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
