They wanted that wall. They were calling. Everybody was call -- I won't even tell. I won't embarrass them by saying who called. But people that didn't want the wall outside wanted the wall. And I built the wall, and it worked 100 percent. You know what I'm talking about. And then, I see one of the politicians two weeks later. ‘They should take down the wall.’ By the way, it worked so well. But he was saying, ‘They should've taken down the wall.’ But now they don't even say that, because now it stopped COVID; it stopped everything. It stopped the whole deal.”","analysis":"A slew of falsehoods. Trump repeatedly has claimed that San Diego local officials clamored for his border wall. The city council and Republican mayor vocally opposed it, as do local and state officials throughout California including the state's Democratic governor. No evidence shows the barrier Trump is building works \"100 percent\" -- in fact, numerous reports have documented how the fence can be breached with power tools, climbed with ladders or beaten down by nature. Public health experts say Trump's fence, most of it still under construction, had no impact on the spread of covid-19 in the United States. Travelers from China and Europe brought the virus to the United States, and the disease spread for months inside the country due to lax and inconsistent containment measures from U.S. political leaders. A range of U.S. metropolitan areas including Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Washington, D.C., all had higher coronavirus infection rates than Mexican cities and states along the border when Trump made these remarks.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
