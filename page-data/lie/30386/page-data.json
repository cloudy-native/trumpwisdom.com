And we're making trade deals with each. Not the biggest thing for us, but for them it was very important. And I heard about it, I called up, I said, 'Fellas, tell them we're not making any deals unless they create peace and they stop killing each other.' Now I know -- I don't -- I've never been there but I've heard the story, and you have for years, and all of a sudden they ended up making peace. And they came to the White House and they start hugging each other, they signed a peace deal, and then we signed. It cost me absolutely nothing, and now they're happy, and they have two trade deals. But to me, more important than the trade deals is the fact that these two countries aren't going to be killing each other any more.”","analysis":"Trump falsely-- and bizarrely -- takes credit for ending a war between Serbia and Kosovo that ended more than two decades ago. Despite continued tensions, the two sides have not directly fought each other since 1999. Trump helped negotiate an economic normalization deal between Kosovo and Serbia, but that agreement mostly involved economic and transportation links, and it did not solve tougher geopolitical issues like Serbia’s refusal to recognize Kosovo ever since the country declared its independence in 2008.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30386, 30272, 29720, 30033, 28579, 28391, 27963, 28257","repeated_count":"8","date":"11/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
