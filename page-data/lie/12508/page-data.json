Harry Truman had the idea of Greenland. I had the idea. Other people have had the idea. It goes back into the early 1900s. But Harry Truman, very strongly, thought it was a good idea. I think it's a good idea because Denmark is losing $700 million a year with it. It doesn't do them any good.”","analysis":"The Truman administration did secretly propose to buy Greenland during the Cold War. But Trump exaggerates by saying the idea has been \"discussed for many years,\" that it goes \"back into the early 1900s,\" and that Denmark loses $700 million a year maintaining the island. It provided a $550 million subsidy in 2017, plus some administrative costs.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
