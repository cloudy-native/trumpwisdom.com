There’s no way to spin this except as a failure, especially since passage in the House would only be the first step on a long legislative journey. Senate Republicans generally are cool to the House proposal and are likely to pursue their own path. Then the two versions must be reconciled and pass both chambers before success could be declared. But Trump failed to advance even to first base. It’s true he might get another chance at-bat, but the effort is indeed a failure so far.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/12/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
