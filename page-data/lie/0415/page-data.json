You read Clinton’s book, he said, ‘Oh, we made such a great peace deal,’ and it was a joke. You look at different things over the years with President Obama. Everybody has been outplayed, they’ve all been outplayed by this gentleman. And we’ll see what happens. But I just don’t telegraph my moves.”","analysis":"This is an odd statement. It's unclear whether Trump knows that there have been three North Korean leaders since Bill Clinton's presidency, all with the last name Kim. It's a misleading claim that the past three presidents have \"all been outplayed by this gentleman.\" It's actually three men in the same Kim family: Kim Il-Sung, Kim Jong-Il and Kim Jong-Un.
