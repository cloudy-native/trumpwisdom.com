Six million jobs, at least, gone.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to U.S. factory closures and job losses since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. The number for factory closures is accurate, but to suggest China was the only factor is misleading. Economists say automation and other forces also played a role. The number for job losses is seriously exaggerated. Official government data show 4.3 million to 4.7 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost after China joined the WTO -- but, again, although China had a big role, it's misleading to blame it all on them.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
