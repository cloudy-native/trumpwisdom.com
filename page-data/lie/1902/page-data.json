I’m the one that created jobs. You know West Virginia is doing fantastically now.”","analysis":"West Virginia's GDP increased 3 percent in the first quarter of 2017. The recent bump is due in part to the increased price of metallurgic coal, which is used to make steel, and a price increase in natural gas exports. West Virginia produces roughly 5 percent of the natural gas in the U.S. and as the price of natural gas rises, the demand for coal increases, spurring growth in the state. Trump can't take credit for the change in prices, which fluctuate with market forces. As for \"saving coal,\" there has barely been any job growth in the coal industry since Trump became president. According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES1021210001\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, only 900 jobs have been created in the coal industry since Trump became president — an increase of less than 3 percent.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"4276, 1902, 1862, 1400, 1525","repeated_count":"5","date":"12/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
