Not fair, Rigged Election! @GovSisolak, will use every trick in the book to cheat with Ballots.”","analysis":"Trump frequently accused Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) of rigging the 2020 election in the state and abusing the mail voting process. The claim is ridiculous, as the governor does not run elections in Nevada. That job falls to the secretary of state, which in 2020 was Republican Barbara Cegavske. There is no evidence of voter fraud on any significant scale in Nevada.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"24322, 24174, 24263, 24139, 24168, 24041, 24044, 24046, 24070, 23918","repeated_count":"10","date":"09/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
