And I think it's a death wish when you -- and I told my people, I said, 'I think you should, you know, study your situation but let us know.' I think we've been treated very unfairly by inspector generals. I can go into instances, but I'm not going to do it now.

But we've had a lot of cases where we thought that was unfair.”","analysis":"IGs are supposed to be independent watchdogs, not beholden to any party or administration.
