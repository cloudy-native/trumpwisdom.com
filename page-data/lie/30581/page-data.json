Is this what our Country has come to?”","analysis":"It’s math, not magic or abuse. Election workers are counting ballots. As more ballots are counted, the totals for each candidate shift, sometimes drastically. That’s because of the way states have set up their election systems, the different approaches taken by the Biden and Trump campaigns and other factors. Biden encouraged supporters to vote early and by mail. Trump falsely denigrated the mail-voting system for months and urged supporters to vote in person.\n\nMeanwhile, because of the coronavirus pandemic, states governed by Republicans and Democrats decided to expand mail-voting options this year. This year, mail-in votes are a much greater proportion of the overall vote when compared with previous elections.\n\nThen, in three key battlegrounds, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the Republican-controlled legislatures rejected proposals that would have allowed an early start for counting mail ballots. The difference can be seen in neighboring states Ohio and Pennsylvania. The former allows early counting and has reported all votes; the latter does not and the count is ongoing. Officials in Pennsylvania began processing 2.6 million mail ballots at 7 a.m. on Election Day. Add it all up, and what we're seeing is something state officials, election experts and news reporters have been outlining for months. Vote counts in some states could show Trump ahead at first and then Biden taking the lead, or vice versa.  In other words, ballots are not being “dumped,” as Trump claims. Vote totals are updated as officials round up more precinct totals.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"30581, 30566, 30567, 30570, 30400, 30402","repeated_count":"6","date":"11/11/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
