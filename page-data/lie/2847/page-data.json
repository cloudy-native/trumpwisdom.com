And he said, because of our tax, because of what we’ve done, they’re bringing in — they’re actually bringing in about $240 billion, but they’re going to be investing $350 billion on new plants and a tremendous campus and lots of other things.”","analysis":"This is a stretch. Apple says it is making a one-time tax payment of $38 billion to repatriate around $250 billion in overseas profit because the corporate tax rate was reduced. But Cook has said much of Apple's $350 billion total U.S. investment over five years would have proceeded with or without the tax cuts.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"17212, 11152, 9674, 7996, 5993, 6195, 5125, 4575, 4325, 3875, 3869, 4157, 3578, 3857, 4034, 2696, 2672, 2847, 2446, 2376, 2248, 2227, 2346, 2292, 2349, 2210, 2323, 2189, 2149, 2157","repeated_count":"30","date":"03/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
