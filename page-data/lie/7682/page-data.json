Trump called Corker and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection, according to Womack. He said the president also reaffirmed that he would have endorsed Corker had he decided to run again — which, Womack added, was not the first time that Trump had extended such an offer of support.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"1314","repeated_count":"1","date":"12/23/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
