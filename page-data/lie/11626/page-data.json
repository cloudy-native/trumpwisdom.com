You're shipping it all over the world, to Vietnam. I was in Vietnam, and they said we get coal from Ohio, we get coal from West Virginia, it's the finest coal in the world. We've created more than 110,000 new mining jobs.”","analysis":"Trump plays some games with the data here. He suggests he's talking about coal mining jobs, but he's actually using Bureau of Labor Statistics data for all mining jobs. There has been a gain of 97,000 mining jobs since he took office, but most of the new jobs were in a subcategory called “support activities for mining.\" BLS data shows about 75 percent of the jobs in the “support for mining” subcategory for oil and gas operations. The plunge in oil prices that started in 2014 wiped out nearly 200,000 jobs in the oil and gas support sector by October, 2016, but a stabilization in oil prices has helped bring some of those jobs back. It has little to do with administration policy — and nothing to do with coal mining. Similarly, Trump takes credit for rising coal exports in 2017, but according to the Energy Information Administration, the U.S. simply reaped the benefits of changing dynamics in the Asian energy market. South Korea is transitioning away from nuclear power, Japan is making up for lost energy capacity after the Fukushima disaster, and two big Asian coal suppliers -- Australia and Indonesia -- had supply disruptions that led buyers to the U.S., the EIA found.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
