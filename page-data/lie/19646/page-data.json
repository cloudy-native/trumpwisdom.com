But it was an illusion. Once a country reaches 100 cases, the number of cases appears to increase 33 percent a day. The United States reached the threshold a little later than some European countries but then followed a similar trajectory. Moreover, inadequate testing in the United States, because of administration fumbles, obscured the number of cases in the United States. “Don't believe the numbers when you see, even on our Johns Hopkins website, that 1,600 Americans have the virus,” Marty Makary, a medical professor at Johns Hopkins University, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marty-makary-on-coronavirus-in-the-us-183558545.html\">told Yahoo News on March 13</a>. “No, that means 1,600 got the test, tested positive. There are probably 25 to 50 people who have the virus for every one person who is confirmed.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"25244, 25983, 24075, 23750, 23770, 23734, 23586, 23618, 23708, 23728, 23494, 22297, 21331, 22210, 22217, 22787, 21753, 21767, 21721, 21695, 20833, 22591, 20641, 20598, 20386, 20437, 20454, 20249, 20301, 19783, 19750, 19662, 19668, 19646, 19632, 19561, 19546, 19533, 19510, 19466, 19446, 19055, 19105, 17921, 17951, 17132, 17039, 18499, 17968, 17871, 17639, 18062, 17567, 17543, 18128, 17214","repeated_count":"56","date":"05/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
