They don't write the truth.”","analysis":"When Trump doesn't like what's being reported, he calls it fake news. But in almost every case, the reports are proven to be accurate and the substance of Trump's complaint is that the facts reflect poorly on him. Reputable news organizations follow ethical rules and correct mistakes promptly, something Trump knows since he often celebrates these corrections on Twitter. These overheated comments are not based in facts. Moreover, legitimate news organizations do not make up sources or quotes. That is a firing offense. News organizations also do not deliberately manipulate polls to make Trump look bad. Mainstream news organizations are also not \"enemy of the people.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"29885, 30513, 29614, 30021, 30077, 28611, 28451, 27042, 26188, 25619, 25154, 25601, 25589, 25971, 25839, 24879, 24887, 24583, 24613, 24181, 23916, 23314, 23375, 23422, 23370, 23371, 23374, 23223, 23231, 23207, 23108, 22476, 21706, 21339, 21380, 21734, 20575, 20502, 19967, 20135, 19869, 19858, 19853, 20367, 19838, 19840, 19835, 19361, 18967, 18973, 19667, 19674, 19676, 18951, 18902, 18944, 18886, 18699, 18929, 19185, 18616, 18622, 18666","repeated_count":"63","date":"09/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
