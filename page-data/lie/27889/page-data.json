No, NAFTA does not transform Mexico into a mirror-image of our country, but no trade agreement can, or ever will.” The side agreements lacked enforcement mechanisms or teeth but they show Biden was not the knee jerk supporter of free trade as Trump depicts him. As we have often noted, Trump's overstates the economic impact of NAFTA. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service in 2015 concluded the “net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29736, 29781, 29875, 30152, 30203, 30500, 29283, 27777, 29501, 29673, 30009, 28912, 29096, 29169, 28742, 28844, 28108, 28283, 27889, 28110, 26204, 28109, 24937","repeated_count":"23","date":"10/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
