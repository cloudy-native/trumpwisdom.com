Anytime you see an ad from a drug company, and they're rich, the pharma, it's called Big Pharma, the number one lobbyist. They spend millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars online. Anytime you see, anytime at all, you see an ad by Big Pharma against me, you know your drug prices are coming down. That's what it is. They're not happy. And we're giving the rebate that creates tremendous wealth for the middle man, the rebate. It's going to the people now. We're bringing the rebate and it's going to the people.”","analysis":"Through the middle of 2020, pharmaceutical manufacturers spent $87 million on lobbying, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/industries/summary?cycle=2019&id=H4300\">the Center for Responsive Politics</a>.
