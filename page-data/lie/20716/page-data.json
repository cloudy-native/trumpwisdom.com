We were going in, we were going in very soon. We let them know that. And they, all of a sudden, they didn't want that, so they went in before we got there. But we were going in very shortly, very soon, and we would have taken the CHOP [Capitol Hill Organized Protest] I call it, CHOP, we would have taken it back very easily.
