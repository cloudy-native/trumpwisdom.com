That's a tremendous turn.”","analysis":"South Korea and the United States both reported their first coronavirus case on the same day — Jan. 21. But South Korea acted quickly to begin testing citizens, tracing all possible contacts. The government urged medical companies to quickly produce tests, while opening 600 test centers and 50 drive-through testing centers. The result was that Korea immediately caught many cases and thus did not need to shut down vast segments of its economy. In terms of raw number of tests, the United States eventually caught up and exceeded Korea, conducting about 320,000 tests over an eight-day period between March 15 and March 24, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily\">according to the website covidtracking.com</a>. That’s not an official source — it is maintained by volunteers, using data from states — but it appears much more up to date than the numbers published by the CDC, which show fewer than 100,000 tests. South Korea, meanwhile, reported nearly 349,000 tests. The larger point is this: South Korea, with about 51 million people, has less than one-sixth the U.S. population of 327 million people. That means South Korea tested 1 in 146 people, while the United States has only managed 1 in 911. The United States would need to conduct six times more tests to be in the same league as South Korea.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"18559, 17934, 17717, 17729, 18520, 18526","repeated_count":"6","date":"03/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
