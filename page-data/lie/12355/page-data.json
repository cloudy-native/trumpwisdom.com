He talked about what he's doing. He's not happy with the testing. It's a very small testing that we did. But he wasn't happy with the testing; he put that in the letter. But he also sees a great future for North Korea. And so we'll see how it all works out. In the meantime, I say it again: There have been no nuclear tests. The missile tests have all been short-range. No ballistic missile tests. No long-range missiles. … He wasn't happy with the tests -- the war games. The war games on the other side, with the United States. And as you know, I've never liked it either. I've never liked it. I've never been a fan. You know why? I don't like paying for it. We should be reimbursed for it, and I've told that to South Korea.”","analysis":"Trump's excuses for Kim Jong Un -- that the North Korean dictator \"wasn't happy\" with missile tests amid haphazard and largely fruitless nuclear negotiations with the United States -- strain credulity.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
