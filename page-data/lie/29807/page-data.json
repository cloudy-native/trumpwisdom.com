He really isn't. You know it, I know it, everybody knows it. I have foreign leaders calling me saying, 'Are they serious?' I say -- One of them called, said, 'I see that you're down a little bit in a poll.' I said, 'Can you believe this could happen to me? I'd rather run against someone that was good or even outstanding.' ...And, by the way, just so you understand, 'cause look, Joe -- Joe is, has no clue, okay? Just -- Joe's, Joe's not -- He's not calling the shots. And I guarantee he won't be calling 'em for very long.”","analysis":"Without evidence, Trump suggests that Joe Biden has suffered a mental decline that makes him unfit for the presidency.
