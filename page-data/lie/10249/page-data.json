Yes, I won't say it. I don't want to embarrass anybody. The last thing I want to do is embarrass somebody. But they lose -- we spend $5 billion a year defending them, right? So I said to the generals, how much do we spend next day? Sir, we spent $5 billion. Very wealthy country. I said, 'How much do they pay?' 'Sir, they pay $500 million.' I said, you mean we lose $4.5 billion to defender them? And they're rich? So I called the country. Right? I called the country.  So we lose $4.5 billion for the privilege of defending a country that's very tough on us on trade and various other things. Right. So I called I said, 'Listen, no good.' Now, they were in a state of shock, because they never got a call like this in 25 years. I said it's no good. We're losing $4.5 billion. It's no good. We can't do this anymore. This is crazy. And he got very upset, angry. This is not fair. I said, 'Of course, it's fair.' He said, 'Well, we'll give you $500 million more.' Because the budget, you see had already been set. There's only a month left. So you know, I said you know what? I want more. We argue, so they paid us more than $500 million for one phone call. It took me one call.”","analysis":"In previous remarks, Trump has identified this unnamed country as South Korea. But it's totally false. The U.S. neither spends $5 billion a year on defending South Korea nor did the Koreans agree to pay $500 million more. They agreed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/world/asia/trump-south-korea.html\">a $70 million increase</a>, going to $925 million. Under a long-standing agreement, South Korea paid nearly $830 million a year to host U.S. forces -- representing half the cost. The Wall Street Journal <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/military-spending-spat-stirs-worry-over-u-s-forces-in-korea-11549195200\">reported</a> that Trump administration officials asked South Korea for a 50 percent increase. Trump may think he got it, but he didn't. As a percentage of its GDP, South Korea spends more on defense than the United States. And the U.S. keeps nearly 28,500 troops in South Korea not just to defend that country but to further its own interests in the region.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"16656, 15802, 12490, 12604, 11319, 10556, 10869, 10249, 8787, 8717, 8475, 6020, 5371, 5772","repeated_count":"14","date":"04/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
