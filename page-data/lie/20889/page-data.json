It is their number one passion in life, but nobody complains. My “exercise” is playing, almost never during the week, a quick round of golf. Obama played more and much longer rounds, no problem. When I play, Fake News CNN, and others, park themselves anywhere they can to get a picture, then scream 'President Trump is playing golf.' Actually, I play VERY fast, get a lot of work done on the golf course, and also get a 'tiny' bit of exercise. Not bad!”","analysis":"False. Obama played 98 rounds of golf through this point in his presidency, according to data <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/25/politics/fact-check-trump-obama-golf/index.html\">provided to CNN</a> by Mark Knoller, a veteran CBS News White House correspondent who is known for tracking presidential activities. By contrast, Knoller said, Trump has spent all or part of 248 days at a golf course.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
