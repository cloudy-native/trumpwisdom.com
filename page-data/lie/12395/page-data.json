The taxes are really unfair. The tariffs were ridiculous. What they do to us in Europe and then we protect them, then they don't pay.”","analysis":"The United States contributes to NATO to protect its own national security and economic interests, not as part of some trade agreement. Furthermore, it's false to claim that European NATO members \"don't pay\" their contributions. Trump also mischaracterizes how international trade works. Some countries dominate some markets and don't compete as much in others, leading to variable rates of tariffs and trade barriers. For example, the French have trade restrictions on U.S. wine, just as the U.S. has trade restrictions on French clothing.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
