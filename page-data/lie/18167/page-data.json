In just three years in my administration, 3.5 million people have joined the workforce.”","analysis":"This factoid is based on a complicated formulation. But Trump gooses the numbers by assigning a month to Obama that more properly belongs to George W. Bush, when nearly 800,000 jobs were lost at the height of the Great Recession. Moreover, Obama took office during an economic crisis. A better measure would be to compare the last three years of Obama with the first three years of Trump. That yields 2.3 million for Obama vs. 3 million for Trump. That’s still an edge for Trump, but not nearly as dramatic as he suggested in his remarks.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"16882, 16829, 18167","repeated_count":"3","date":"01/21/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
