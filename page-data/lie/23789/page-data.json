(The $130 billion is an estimate for cumulative defense spending through 2020, in 2015 dollars, as an increase over 2016 spending.) Trump falsely claims this is $130 billion a year, rather than over four years. The $400 billion figure is for eight years.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"27785, 26954, 26129, 25666, 25724, 25378, 24639, 23789","repeated_count":"8","date":"09/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
