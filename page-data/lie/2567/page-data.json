The two-year budget agreement I just reached with Congress will provide $700 billion in defense funding this year, the largest ever, larger by far than any country has ever spent. And next year we will raise that number to $716 billion. That's a lot of money, even for you, that's a lot of money.”","analysis":"Trump did get a $700 billion dollar military budget. But saying it's the biggest budget ever is a stretch. {As a percent of GDP}, it's among the smallest military budgets the U.S. has had since 1960. All of Obama's spending budgets were larger up until 2015.
