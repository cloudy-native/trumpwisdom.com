Even got our hostages/remains!”","analysis":"Trump offers up a false conspiracy theory that the news media coordinates efforts to disparage him. Trump claims to have gotten \"so much for peace in the world\" because he and Kim Jong Un signed a vague joint statement on denuclearization June 12. But experts say and satellite imagery indicates that North Korea continues to pursue a nuclear program. The remains of U.S. soldiers lost in the Korean War had not been returned when Trump tweeted this, and what he describes as \"finals\" are actually fledgling negotiations between the two countries.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/17/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
