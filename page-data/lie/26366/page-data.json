Okay, very simple: I said, that's it, whether they like us in there or not, we're going in. They took over a big piece of the city and they weren't going to do anything. They knew we were going in and so the night before, they said, you know these little facts that I give you just to give you because that's the way it works is supposed to ask us. The governors are supposed to ask us, but these radical left, you know if you look at Republican-run states and cities they're doing phenomenally well, never done better.”","analysis":"Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan flatly denied to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/10/trump-told-hannity-story-about-threatening-seattle-mayor-says-it-never-happened/\">The Washington Post PlumLine</a> that any conversation like this with Trump — or anyone around him — ever took place. “He never contacted me or my office to warn us,” Durkan said, adding that no one from the White House and no one connected to Trump had told them any such thing. “We had no conversations whatsoever with the White House about anything related to the protests, Capitol Hill, or anything along these lines,” Durkan told us, though conversations related to coronavirus had taken place at various junctures. “It just never happened,” Durkan said. “I don't know what world he’s living in.” The mayor had signed an executive order on June 30th to formally close the area and on July 1 police moved in to clear it.
