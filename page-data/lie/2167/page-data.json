But it's misleading to say that they are \"not many.\"  There’s barely a trade deficit in goods with the United Kingdom, according to the International Trade Commission, and the United States has a trade surplus with Hong Kong ($30 billion), Netherlands ($24 billion), United Arab Emirates ($21 billion), Belgium ($15 billion), Australia ($14 billion), Singapore ($10 billion) and Brazil ($4 billion), among others.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"10218, 9681, 8365, 7518, 5473, 5445, 5710, 4740, 3820, 3440, 3905, 3310, 3324, 3075, 3081, 2757, 2583, 3027, 2534, 2497, 3028, 2436, 2167, 1853, 3029, 3030, 1590, 1503, 1496, 0947, 0464, 0137","repeated_count":"32","date":"01/10/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
