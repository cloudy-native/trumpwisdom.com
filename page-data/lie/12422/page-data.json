Would have been in shambles. Our auto industry is coming back so strong. It would have gutted, would have destroyed the industry. But in my first week in office, I proudly withdrew the United States from that job, destroying catastrophe.”","analysis":"Under the TPP, the United States would have had up to 30 years to phase out tariffs on cars and light trucks imported from Japan. But overall the impact on the auto industry was believed to be limited. The pact essentially preserved the status quo on trucks in the United States, the most profitable part of the market. Tariffs on trucks brought into the U.S. has forced foreign carmakers to build truck and SUV plants in the United States. Meanwhile, the TPP would have bolstered auto exports as other countries would have been forced to eliminate tariffs, such as Malaysia’s 30 percent foreign tax on autos, and Vietnam’s foreign tax of 70 percent on autos.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29694, 30506, 29600, 30012, 29109, 28782, 27835, 26663, 27467, 26117, 25254, 25894, 24092, 24002, 16192, 16334, 15517, 12422, 10245, 9540","repeated_count":"20","date":"08/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
