It was incredible. Wages going up 3.1 percent. If you look at every single element of that report was a 10. It was perfect. And we have the greatest economy ever, but you people don't want to cover that.”","analysis":"The president can certainly brag about the state of the economy, but he runs into trouble when he repeatedly makes a play for the history books. By just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton — and Ulysses S. Grant. The October jobs numbers exceeded even the high range of consensus forecast, but there have been many months with higher job gains. (The Bureau of Labor Statistics later revised the estimate to 237,000.) Just in August, 286,000 jobs were created. The jobs number topped 250,000 two earlier months in 2018. And Obama had four months above 250,000 in 2016, when Trump was telling audiences that the economy was lousy.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"6690, 6720, 6948, 7132, 6669, 6621","repeated_count":"6","date":"11/04/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
