Therefore, effective immediately, Chris Krebs has been terminated as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.”","analysis":"Trump fired the highly respected Krebs after Krebs called out the president' falsehoods about the election. Trump's repeated claims that GOP poll watchers were barred in key states are false, as is his bogus claim that  votes were secretly changed by machines managed by Dominion Voting Systems, which makes software that local governments around the nation use to help run their elections.
