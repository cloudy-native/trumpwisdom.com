He couldn't get confirmed by the Senate.”","analysis":"Bolton, who was Trump's national security adviser for 17 months, was confirmed by the Senate for a number of administration posts. His nomination to be UN ambassador had majority support in the Senate but was subjected to a Democratic filibuster, requiring 60 votes to proceed to a final vote. He became UN ambassador through a recess appointment. The rules have since changed so administration positions are no longer subject to the 60-vote hurdle -- which is a key reason why Trump has managed to name so many right-wing figures. Bolton would not have had trouble winning Senate approval under the current rules.
