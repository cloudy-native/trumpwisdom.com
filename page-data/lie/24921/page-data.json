Trump frequently claims he took bold action that was criticized, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">news reports say</a> he had been reluctant to impose the ban, citing his relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but the action was urged by his top health advisers. (Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters on Feb. 7: “The travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental. These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.”) Moreover, many U.S. airlines already were canceling flights. (Whatever criticism there was was scattered and relatively muted. Trump sometimes points to a comment by former vice president Joe Biden -- “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia — hysterical xenophobia — and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science\" -- but Biden says that did not refer to the travel restrictions.) The virus was already spreading through the United States and there is little evidence it saved lives, especially since the Trump administration did not rapidly set up an effective testing regime like many other countries.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28381, 28850, 27712, 26301, 25480, 24921, 24951, 24268, 24038, 23373, 23690, 22084, 22081, 21960, 21028, 21597, 22483, 22259, 21356, 21246, 20835, 21079, 20671, 20039, 19944, 18761, 19393, 19338, 19784, 18990, 19752, 19215, 18868, 18825, 19574, 18756, 19260, 19263, 18708, 18938, 19178, 19189, 18617, 19433, 19108, 19024, 18514, 17894, 17698, 17692, 18497, 17870, 17985, 17624, 17640, 17862, 17863, 18077, 17565, 17542, 18443, 17857, 17860, 18127","repeated_count":"64","date":"09/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
