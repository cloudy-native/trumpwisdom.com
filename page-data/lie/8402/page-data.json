They’ve spent all this money. Nothing. No phone calls, no meetings, no nothing.”","analysis":"There's no evidence that the special counsel investigation is a witch hunt or a hoax. In fact, the special counsel has revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The investigation into potential collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign continues, and no conclusions have been announced. As for the investigation's cost, Mueller's office reported that it had spent $25.5 million through September 2018. However, independent estimates suggest the valued Manafort's seized assets at $46 million — nearly double Mueller's expenditures. In other words, the investigation is a net positive.
