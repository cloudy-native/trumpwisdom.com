In fact, the special counsel has revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The investigation into potential collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign continues, and no conclusions have been announced. Plus, Comey and Mueller certainly know each other but \"best friends\" is a stretch.
