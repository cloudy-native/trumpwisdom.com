Comey. Rather, it was the president’s actions before and after the former FBI director’s dismissal that prompted the inquiry. Ahead of the firing, there was serious concern about Trump’s tone toward Comey. Then, after the firing, Trump admitted his action was because of the Russia investigation, and told Russian officials that he had faced “great pressure because of Russia” that was relieved by Comey’s dismissal. In the same conversation, he called Comey a “real nut job.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
