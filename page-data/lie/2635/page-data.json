Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!”","analysis":"The Postal Service reported a net loss in 2017, and it does offer Amazon cut rates. But that’s not the whole story. E-commerce deliveries are one of the post office’s few thriving and growing lines of business. The online retail giant clearly leverages many tools to keep the taxman at bay. That doesn’t erase its state and local tax bills, which are larger than Trump allows. Lastly, the Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos not Amazon.
