And we're certainly under attack by criminal gangs, by criminals themselves, by the human traffickers, and by drugs of all kinds. Much of it comes through the southern border.”","analysis":"Most drugs are smuggled in through legal ports of entry, and those entryways would still exist if Trump's wall were built. Trump exaggerates the link between immigration and crime; almost all research shows legal and illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population. Any wall would be built a mile or so inland from the border. Many of the families attempting to immigrate from Central America are seeking asylum. To petition for asylum, a person needs to be on U.S. soil under current law. So in theory, immigrants could cross the border and file a legally valid petition for asylum before reaching Trump's wall. The incentive would still exist.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8821, 8567, 8592, 8487, 8487, 8495, 8504, 8505, 8382, 8292, 8274, 7803, 8010, 8007, 8130, 7794, 8189, 8202, 8229, 8246, 8246, 8250, 7762, 7762, 8004, 8077, 8092, 7970, 7971, 7979, 7980, 7999, 8209, 8219, 7960, 7880, 7861","repeated_count":"37","date":"01/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
