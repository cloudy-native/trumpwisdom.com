We have the anti-missile missiles that shoot down missiles many, many miles away in the sky, like a needle in a haystack. They shoot them down, hard to believe.

You don't want us to put -- explain that to me, please. Remember? They used to get angry when we would put defensive missiles, anti-missile missiles in our country. And so we wouldn't do it.”","analysis":"It's false to claim that the the United States is being surrounded by missile defense systems.
