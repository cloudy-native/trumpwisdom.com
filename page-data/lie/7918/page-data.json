But it was out of control. And our strong economy makes it even more difficult because people come up, because our country is doing better, by far, than any other country in the world, from an economic standpoint.”","analysis":"Trump gives a distorted picture of the Central American migration phenomenon. A 2014 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service found that “high violent crime rates, poor economic conditions fueled by relatively low economic growth rates, high rates of poverty, and the presence of transnational gangs” were some of the motivating factors for Central Americans seeking to immigrate to the United States. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees interviewed 404 children from Mexico and Central America who entered the United States from October 2011 to 2013. It found that 48 percent had “experienced serious harm or had been threatened by organized criminal groups or state actors.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
