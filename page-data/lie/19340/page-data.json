Scarborough had just resigned from the House of Representatives and was about to start a cable-news career. Don Imus' co-hosts made a joke about it and, later, Imus briefly brought it up to Scarborough, who laughed. “Don't be afraid to be funny, because you are funny. You know, I ask you why you won Congress, you said you'd had sex with the intern and then you had to kill her, that’s pretty risky to say,” Imus says. “Exactly, what’re you gonna do,” Scarborough replies, laughing. Mika Brzezinski, Scarborough's wife, said that Scarborough had been \"embarrassed\" by Imus' comment and was \"trying to move on to talk about the show\" during his appearance. Trump has repeatedly suggested Scarborough was involved in the death of an aide named Lori Kaye Klausutis, who was 28 at the time. She died from a fall related to an undiagnosed heart disease in what police and the medical examiner determined was an accidental death.
