It would have been impossible for me to know this but, if that was the case, and with me being one of two people who would become president, why was I not told so that I could make a change?”","analysis":"In a narrow, technical sense, Trump was not warned that Flynn was being investigated as a possible Russian agent. But there were plenty of other flashing lights that Flynn was trouble — warnings that Trump chose to ignore. Whether the FBI would have been comfortable telling a presidential candidate that the aide sitting by his side was the subject of a counterintelligence inquiry is an interesting question. Moreover, whether Trump would have accepted such an explicit warning is unclear. He has been deeply skeptical of intelligence that did not conform to his views. In any case, it’s misleading to frame the lack of a warning about Flynn in such a narrow fashion. There were many warning signs.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
