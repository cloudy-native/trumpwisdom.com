But those numbers aren't as simple as they seem. The Post reported, “New York’s homeless population increased, but that could be because the city stepped up efforts to house the homeless and thus converted hard-to-count people living on the streets into easier-to-count people in shelter programs. It appeared as though the city’s homeless population climbed, but it may just be counting better.” In California, the bulk of the homeless population is in Los Angeles, but Pelosi represents San Francisco.  Overall, the number of unsheltered homeless people has risen since 2016, but has declined dramatically since 2007.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
