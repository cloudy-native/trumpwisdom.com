It's unclear yet if Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly made an impact, or if it was a result of Trump's rhetoric on immigration throughout the presidential campaign. There tends to be less activity during winter months, and the numbers bounce back in March and through the spring, so it's unclear whether this is a blip or a lasting trend. Moreover, the January data captures the whole month, not just since Inauguration Day.
