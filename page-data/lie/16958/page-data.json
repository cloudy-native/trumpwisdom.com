Don't you think we wanted to know that before we put you on this jury.’ Pretty obvious he should (get a new trial). I think almost any judge in the Country would order a new trial, I'm not so sure about Judge Jackson, I don’t know.”","analysis":"Trump often touts a bogus allegation against the jury foreperson of the jury in the Roger Stone trial, based on recently discovered tweets.Tomeka Hart’s political leanings and activities were clearly known during the jury selection process, and not even Stone’s legal team tried to strike her from the jury pool. The judge in response questioned Hart and also brought in two other jurors for questioning, both of whom said that Hart did not try to prejudice the panel and did not appear biased. The judge said the testimony showed that there was little evidence that Hart had acted improperly on the jury and added that Hart’s political beliefs would not be grounds for a new trial. “The president of the United States used his Twitter platform to disseminate a particular point of view about a juror,” the judge said. “Any attempt to invade the privacy of the jurors or to harass or intimidate them is completely antithetical to our system of justice. ... They deserve to have their privacy protected.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"20877, 20860, 20732, 20753, 20510, 19739, 19721, 18891, 19511, 19478, 17858, 17211, 18426, 16958, 16968","repeated_count":"15","date":"02/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
