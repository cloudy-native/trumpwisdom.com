Twenty-nine FBI agents loaded up with the most powerful rifles and machine guns, they attack him early in the morning. His wife has a tremendous hearing problem, virtually no hearing. They barged into their bedroom. This is early in the morning. CNN following them. So they were obviously alerted. You know nobody has been able to figure that one out and they should be able to figure it out, it is really easy to figure it out if they wanted to. CNN was following them.”","analysis":"CNN <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/25/politics/roger-stone-raid/index.html\">reported</a> they had staked out Stone’s house after rumors of a Mueller indictment. Here’s how they describe the scene: “About a dozen officers with heavy weapons and tactical vests fanned out across Stone's lawn. Law enforcement shined a flashlight into Stone's front door, and one officer rapped against it, shouting ‘FBI. Open the door.’ The agent shouted seconds later: ‘FBI. Warrant.’ A second-floor light turned on, and moments later, Stone appeared in the front entryway. He confirmed who he was to law enforcement. It wasn't immediately clear that Stone had been arrested, as the FBI moved CNN's camera far back down the street once they went in.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
