Now we have to do it the hard way, with a Shutdown. Too bad!”","analysis":"Trump had had a chance to strike a deal. Democrats came to Trump with a bipartisan plan that had been crafted in the Senate to spend $25 billion over ten years on a border wall and provide protections for 1.8 million \"Dreamers\" who had arrived illegally as children. But he rejected it. The bipartisan proposal had the most support in the Senate, including from eight Republicans, but was blocked from a final vote because of GOP opposition. Trump's proposal, which came with limits on legal immigration, received the least support and was roundly rejected by a combination of Republicans and Democrats. The funding bill currently offered by Democrats would provide $1.3 billion for border security, but not the president's wall.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"21111, 20798, 19992, 17340, 10760, 8412, 7978, 7983, 7895, 7896, 7745, 7299, 7453, 7471, 3511, 2642, 2810, 2808, 2605, 2602, 2608, 2609, 2618, 2599, 2600, 2612, 2582, 2528, 2474, 2476, 2477, 2406, 2431, 2382, 2433, 2442, 2314, 2264, 2272, 2274, 2275, 2233, 2305, 2307, 2232, 2202, 2169, 2170, 2173, 2177, 2139, 2086, 2058, 2065, 2059, 2060","repeated_count":"56","date":"12/29/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
