As special counsel Robert Mueller's report says, there was evidence that the Trump campaign cooperated with Russians during the 2016 election, but not enough to bring conspiracy or illegal coordination charges. There was also significant evidence that Trump obstructed justice. Mueller said he declined to reach a decision on obstruction charges in part because of a Justice Department policy not to indict the sitting president and in part because he didn't want to get in the way of a potential impeachment process in Congress, among other reasons.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
