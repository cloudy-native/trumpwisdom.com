In any case, the U.S. is not being shortchanged. The Pentagon spends an estimated $10 billion a year on overseas bases. More than 70 percent of the total is spent in Japan, Germany and South Korea, but much of the cost is already funded by U.S. allies. Germany provides in-kind services for the U.S. bases, and the cost of running them is a pittance of the U.S. military bases. The cost of the U.S. military presence in Japan is about $5.5 billion, and Japan pays about 80 percent of that in direct support and indirect support. South Korea recently paid about 90 percent of the cost of building the news military base outside Seoul. Korean officials say they underwrite about 70 percent of the costs of existing bases, when the cost of rent-free land is included.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
