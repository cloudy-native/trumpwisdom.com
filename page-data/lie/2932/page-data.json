He didn't write those memos accurately. He put a lot of phony stuff. For instance, I went to Russia for a day or so -- a day or two because I own the Miss Universe pageant. So, I went there to watch it because it was near Moscow. So I go to Russia -- now, I did go there -- everybody knows. The locks are there, the planes are there. He said I didn't stay there a night. Of course, I stayed there. I stayed there a very short period of time but, of course, I stayed. Well, his memo said I left immediately. I never said that. I never said I left immediately.”","analysis":"Former FBI Director James Comey in his memos twice mentioned that Trump, unprompted, claimed he did not stay overnight in Moscow. At the time Comey would have had no reason to invent these statements, and he makes no comment one way or the other about Trump's remarks. Given that Comey wrote the memos immediately after meeting with Trump, the odds favor his version of the conversation.
