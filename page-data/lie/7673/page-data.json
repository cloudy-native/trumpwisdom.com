After ruling, Dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today, Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall.”","analysis":"The 9th circuit ruling on DACA was in November, 2018. Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Charles Schumer announced they had a deal with Trump on DACA in Sept. 2017 that did not include wall funding, but then Trump later backed out of it after pressure from his right flank and he began to push for broad changes to the immigration system in exchange for allowing DACA-eligible people to remain. But a bipartisan coalition in the Senate roundly rejected a measure backed by Trump that would have all but ended the family-based migration system that has been in place for decades. A separate bipartisan measure that would have legalized the DACA \"Dreamers\" and allocated $25 billion for a wall on the border with Mexico fell six votes short of the 60 needed to proceed to a final vote. But it earned far more votes than Trump's preferred approach.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/27/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
