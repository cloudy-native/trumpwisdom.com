The report makes a number of generous assumptions about the impact of deregulation in order come up with this $3,000 figure, but experts we consulted found the assumptions and conclusions to be dubious. One expert cited in the report said the analysis was “just crazy” and “anti-academic.” The report also does not account for administration actions that have lowered household incomes, such as Trump’s trade war.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"30617, 28374, 21496, 21407, 21177, 17317, 18176, 16721, 16112, 16182, 16324, 15680, 15597, 13544, 12842, 13683, 12735, 11625, 12168, 11796","repeated_count":"20","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
