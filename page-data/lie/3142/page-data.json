The theory is that Clapper pushed then-FBI director James B. Comey to brief President-elect Donald Trump about the dossier with salacious material about Trump in Russia and then tipped CNN’s Jake Tapper about the briefing so CNN would have a hook to report on the dossier’s existence. But Clapper told The Fact Checker that the first time he ever \"interacted\" with Tapper was on May 14, 2017, four months after the dossier leaked. Clapper said interaction – that means interviews, emails, text messages, anything. The two men simply did not have a relationship.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/28/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
