The United States ran trade deficits in goods (Trump's preferred metric) with Mexico five out of the ten years before the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c2010.html#1992\">according to the Census Bureau</a>. In the years when the United States ran a goods surplus, it was never more than $5 billion and usually about $1-2 billion. But what matters is not the deficit or surplus but rather the level of trade between the two countries. Cross border trade in goods was about $100 billion in 1994, compared to more than $500 billion in 2018.  According to the Department of Commerce, U.S. exports of Goods and Services to Mexico supported an estimated 1.2 million jobs in 2015 (latest data available).","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
