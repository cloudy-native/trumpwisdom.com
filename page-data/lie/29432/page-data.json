We build it for slightly less. First I picked a site that we already owned. You know, that's better than paying millions for a site. But I picked one that was a better location, bigger, better. Then they were gonna build a building for anywhere between one billion and two -- this is like a two-story building, right? One billion and two billion -- And we built it for $500,000. A slight saving. We had an existing building that we fixed up... And we opened it for 500,000 instead of two billion dollars.”","analysis":"The new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem for about $400,000. (Trump sometimes claims it cost $500,000.)
