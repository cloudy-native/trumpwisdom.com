Remember, everybody said you won't bring it up to 1 percent. You won't bring it up to 1.2 percent....So we have a GDP, it was shocking, about two weeks ago it was announced for the quarter: 2.6 percent. Remember, I said we’re going to try and hit 3 percent? We’re already at 2.6. Maybe I’ll have to increase my offer.”","analysis":"GDP growth was 3.6 percent in the third quarter of 2016, so there is nothing amazing or shocking about 2.6 percent. Trump during the campaign pledged to achieve 4 percent annual growth, which most economists said was unrealistic. Since he took office, the president misleadingly has said he pledged three percent growth.
