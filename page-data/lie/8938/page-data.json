Never done when a president is overseas. Shame!”","analysis":"Trump, without evidence, suggests the failure of his North Korea summit occurred because Democrats held a hearing featuring his former attorney Michael Cohen. By many accounts, the summit failed because of lack of diplomatic preparation, inflated expectations on the part of the president and missed signals by the North Koreans. Trump previously said he \"walked\" because the North Korea offer was inadequate. Congress does not stop its work when the president is overseas, and controversy back home often follows a president overseas. As for Cohen being a \"convicted liar and fraudster,\" he was a loyal aide for many years to Trump and has said some of his criminal acts were at the behest of the president.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
