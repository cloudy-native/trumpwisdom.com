Rather, the rule is the latest attempt to push the Department of Housing and Urban Development to do more to enforce and implement a section of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 requiring the government to “affirmatively further fair housing.”\n\nThe rule, which was finalized in July 2015 and has been in limbo since Obama left office, is designed to push “meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics.” Put simply, it was designed to help state and local officials provide better access to opportunity, following the original 1968 guideline.\n\nFor evidence of the bleak future, Trump points to his own experience “watching this for years.” But he goes on to bungle the facts, suggesting that following the AFFH would lead to “housing values [dropping] like a rock.” Most research suggests that the proximity of affordable housing does not depress property values.\n\nThe president ought to be familiar with fair housing rules. The government charged Trump, along with his father and their company, with violating the Fair Housing Act in 1973 for not renting to Black people. The Trumps eventually signed a consent decree in 1975, which they were accused of violating just three years later.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30930, 29766, 29867, 30142, 30234, 30480, 29271, 29324, 29401, 29466, 29473, 29980, 28702, 28532, 28371, 28780, 28868, 28065, 28309, 27986, 27599, 27816, 27660, 27775, 28241, 27025, 27052, 26758, 26790, 26625, 27070, 27414, 27111, 27213, 26362, 26428, 26497, 26187, 26105, 25657, 25541, 25511, 25416, 25313, 25158, 25608, 25246, 26062, 25866, 25109, 25047, 24930, 24812, 24843, 24661, 24384, 24479, 23903, 23980, 23352, 23820, 23327, 23331, 23617, 23099, 23116, 23186, 23045, 21968, 22398, 20946, 21560, 22448, 22516, 22209, 22848, 21770, 22706, 22695, 21516, 21426, 21469, 22612, 21193, 21121","repeated_count":"85","date":"08/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
