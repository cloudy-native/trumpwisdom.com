Think of that, $100 billion. And that's a very, very low number.

The FAIR report comes up with a annual $135 billion annual cost by using a high-end estimate for the number of undocumented immigrants and counting the benefits consumed by the children of illegal immigrants born in the U.S., who under law are U.S. citizens – but not the fiscal impact of the children of unauthorized immigrants once they become adults. Other analysts say the cost of illegal immigration is much lower, likely not more than 1/10th the FAIR figure.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31494, 16480, 12997, 8455, 8358, 8037, 7887, 7925, 7658, 7668, 7645, 7271, 7285, 7566, 7264, 6699, 6782, 6932, 6965, 7118, 7155, 6809, 6600, 6765, 7072","repeated_count":"25","date":"11/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
