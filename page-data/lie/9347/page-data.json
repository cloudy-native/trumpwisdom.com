There was no obstruction. There was no nothing. But it's sort of an amazing thing that when you have a great victory, somebody comes and does a report out of nowhere -- tell me how that makes sense -- who never got a vote; who the day before he was retained to become Special Counsel, I told him he wouldn't be working at the FBI. And then the following day, they get him for this.”","analysis":"President Trump frequently said the special counsel's investigation was a witch hunt or a hoax. The special counsel revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The special counsel concluded Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons associated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. But a summary of the special counsel's report, released by Attorney General William Barr, concluded the investigation \"did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\" The special counsel defined “coordination” as an “agreement — tacit or express — between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference.” The special counsel also examined whether Trump obstructed justice. The special counsel’s report states that “while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,\" Barr's summary said.
