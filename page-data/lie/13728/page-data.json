They're phony polls. You know they have phony polls. I told the story the other night.”","analysis":"Trump calls polls phony when he dislikes the result. But this was a real poll, conducted by a respected pollster. The Quinnipiac University poll <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016b-28da-dc80-a3ff-fbfedc700000\">released in June</a> showed that Joe Biden would top Trump by four points — 48 percent to 44 percent — in a general election matchup there. The next strongest candidate in the state was Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who the poll found losing to the president by only 1 point, 46 percent to 45 percent. Next was South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose then-rising star landed him within 2 points of Trump in a head-to-head matchup. The result in the deep red state may be surprising but Quinnipiac <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/pollster-ratings/\">earns a B+ rating</a> from the poling gurus at FiveThirtyEight.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
