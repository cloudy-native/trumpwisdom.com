I view it as record-setting unemployment. We have unemployment that are at the lowest levels that we've ever had. And in particular, with certain groups -- African American, Asian, Hispanic -- they're the lowest levels in the history of our country.”","analysis":"At 3.9 percent, the U.S. unemployment rate is not the lowest in history. The lowest level on record is 2.5 percent in 1953. Furthermore, Trump exaggerates by saying the jobless rates for African Americans, Asians and Hispanics are at their lowest levels in history. They have hit record lows in recent months, but the record doesn't go back very far. None of those rates was calculated before the 1970s. Anyway, those rates have bounced back up after hitting record lows earlier this year.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
