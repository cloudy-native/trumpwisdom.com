Ilhan] Omar -- I don't know, I never met her. I hear the way she talks about al Qaeda. Al Qaeda has killed many Americans. She said, ‘You can hold your chest out, you can -- when I think of America, huh, when I think of al Qaeda, I can hold my chest out.’”","analysis":"Before she was elected to Congress, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) in a 2013 interview noted how one of her college professors would accentuate the Arabic names of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda for effect. She was not proclaiming support for al-Qaeda in that interview and in fact condemned terrorism as evil. Trump twisted these remarks to claim Omar supports terrorists.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
