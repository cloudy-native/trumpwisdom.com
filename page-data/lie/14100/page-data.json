(Turkey considers elements of this force to be a terrorist threat.) To prevent a Turkish invasion, the United States persuaded the SDF to pull back up to nine miles from the Turkish border. In August, the SDF destroyed its own military posts after assurances the United States would not let thousands of Turkish troops invade. But then Trump tossed that aside.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
