Nice!”","analysis":"This is wrong. The price of aluminum had declined 12.8 percent in the London Metal Exchange from the time Trump announced tariffs on the metal to the time he posted this tweet. But that's a decline in global prices. Premiums paid by U.S. buyers of aluminum increased 26 percent. According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-08/trump-touts-lower-aluminum-prices-but-americans-still-pay-more\">a Bloomberg News fact check</a>: \"Trump also cited the jobs he created. While Century Aluminum Co. added 205 jobs last year, that’s not enough to make up for the 600 jobs lost at Alcoa Corp., the largest U.S. aluminum producer. In total, the industries involved in making the refined metal added 300 jobs from April to January, or about 0.5 percent to a total of 58,000, according to Emily Crowley, a principal economist at IHS Markit in Washington.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
