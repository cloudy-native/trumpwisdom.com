They weren't classified like Hillary Clinton. They weren't deleted like Hillary Clinton, who deleted 33- -- she wasn't hiring -- she wasn't doing anything to hide her emails. I looked at it just very briefly today, and the presidential records -- they're all in presidential records. There was no hiding. There was no deleting like Hillary Clinton did. There was no servers in the basement like Hillary Clinton had. You're talking about a whole different -- you're talking about all fake news. So what Ivanka did, it's all in the presidential records. Everything is there. There was no deletion. There was no nothing. What it is is a false story. Hillary Clinton deleted 33,000 emails. She had a server in the basement. That's the real story.”","analysis":"The Washington Post broke this story so we certainly would not agree it was a \"false story\" or \"fake news.\" Ivanka Trump did not have a server in the basement but she said she was unaware of the rules on federal record keeping, which appears surprising given the attention to Clinton's emails. Clinton also turned over emails to the federal records after removing personal ones, as Clinton did. Virtually all of Clinton's emails were classified retroactively.
