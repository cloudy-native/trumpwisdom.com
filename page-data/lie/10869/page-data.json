Very dangerous territory and it costs us $5 billion, and I said to a general, 'Please do me a favor, General.Tell me how much is it cost for us to defend this country, which is very rich?' Sir, I will check. He comes in, 'Sir, it's $5 billion, sir.' I said, 'That's okay. Now, how much do they pay us?' 'Sir, they pay us $500 million.' I say, 'We lose $4.5 million to defend a country that's rich as hell and probably doesn't like us too much.' Can you believe that? And we've been defending it for many years. So I call the leader of the country. I said, 'You know it's not fair. We're spending all of this money, great danger, and we have our men and women, they're the best in the world and we're sending them over to your country, not fair. You got to pay, you've got to pay.' And he said, like the king, he said, 'But nobody's ever asked us that before.' I said, 'That's because you had stupid people.' He said that we can't do anything now because it passed our so-called parliament, and so we can't, it doesn't come due. 'When's next year?' He said, 'Two months.' I said, 'All right, pay me something now. How much will you pay?,' 'We can't pay you more than $500 million.' I got to say there's one phone call, right? They said, 'Make it 750.' Now that's a long way short of four and a half billion that we're losing, but I should make it 750. Anyway, we agreed to a number around 500 million. It was one phone call that lasted for 10 minutes and once they got over the shock of being -- they have plenty of money.”","analysis":"This is totally false. The U.S. neither spends $5 billion a year on defending South Korea nor did the Koreans agree to pay $500 million more. They agreed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/world/asia/trump-south-korea.html\">a $70 million increase</a>, going to $925 million. Under a long-standing agreement, South Korea paid nearly $830 million a year to host U.S. forces -- representing half the cost. The Wall Street Journal <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/military-spending-spat-stirs-worry-over-u-s-forces-in-korea-11549195200\">reported</a> that Trump administration officials asked South Korea for a 50 percent increase. Trump may think he got it, but he didn't. As a percentage of its GDP, South Korea spends more on defense than the United States. And the U.S. keeps nearly 28,500 troops in South Korea not just to defend that country but to further its own interests in the region.","pinocchios":"4","category":"","repeated_ids":"16656, 15802, 12490, 12604, 11319, 10556, 10869, 10249, 8787, 8717, 8475, 6020, 5371, 5772","repeated_count":"14","date":"05/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
