Even the Ukrainian President said there was no pressure!' @RepMarkMeadows”","analysis":"U.S. officials have testified to Congress that the Ukrainian government knew the Trump administration was delaying security assistance funds and that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was preparing to give CNN an interview in which he would announce the investigations Trump wanted. The interview was later canceled, but Trump is stretching Zelensky’s comments. After Trump released the rough transcript of the July 25 phone call with Zelensky, the Ukrainian president said “no one can pressure me.” Zelensky also criticized Trump for holding up U.S. security funds appropriated by Congress. “If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us,” Zelensky told Time magazine. “I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about a quid pro quo.”Many outside experts say that Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was highly unusual. Trump appeared to have no agenda except to ask for the Ukrainian government to work with his private attorney to investigate a potential 2020 presidential rival and also investigate debunked conspiracy theories about possible interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election. Trump made about eight requests for help with some sort of investigation involving either former vice president Joe Biden or the Democrats. Just before the call took place, Trump with no explanation halted the expected delivery of military aid. Some U.S. diplomats believed the halt was connected to the president's demands for a probe of Biden, text messages released by Congress show. Moreover, The Washington Post reported that at least four national security officials were so alarmed by Trump’s ongoing pressure campaign on Ukraine that they lodged objections with a White House lawyer before and right after the call.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
