Nor is that statement true if applied only to the Antrim County tabulators in the Nov. 3 election. And the report Trump reacted to, while ambiguous and inaccurate on the subject of errors, does not make that claim.....The author of the report said the error rate applied not to the number of ballots counted, but rather to the lines or events listed in the tabulators’ activity logs. Trump’s tweet refers to a 'law' about benchmark error rates. There is no such law. The report he alluded to refers to FEC [Federal Election Commission] guidelines that don't exist either.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
