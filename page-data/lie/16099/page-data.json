The dairy tariffs imposed by Canada do not all go away; they remain in place. In the revised North American trade agreement, the Trump administration get win some concessions allowing for greater market access. But the tariffs were not changed. (Canada does have high dairy tariffs once a quota is reached, just as the United States props up sugar prices. But Canada's overall tariffs are lower than the United States -- and Canada made dairy concessions in the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement negotiated by Barack Obama, which Trump pulled out of in the early days of his presidency.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"28985, 26859, 27309, 25250, 24375, 22421, 22557, 22587, 20492, 20771, 18041, 17456, 17845, 16708, 16099, 16250, 12423, 12189, 11468, 10462, 10229, 9677, 8965, 6028, 6287, 5998, 5438, 5783, 5702, 5706, 5725, 5127, 5140, 5659, 5670, 4793, 4994, 4938, 4940, 4694, 4630, 4669, 4440, 4590, 4665, 3695, 3871, 4083, 3835, 4077, 3571, 3988, 4018, 3825, 3484, 3941, 3915, 3362, 3682, 3910, 3306, 3295","repeated_count":"62","date":"01/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
