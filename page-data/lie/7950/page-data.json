I say, ‘Don’t do it.’ You know, if you look back a few months, gasoline was at $83 a barrel, that was going to be bad and it was going to $100 and some people were saying $125, Rick. And I made calls. I say, ‘You'd better let that oil — that gasoline flow,’ and they did and now it’s down to $44, and I put out a social media statement yesterday. I said, ‘Do you think it’s luck that that happened?’ It’s not luck. It’s not luck. I called up certain people and I said, ‘Let that damn oil and gasoline, you let it flow, the oil!’ It was going up to $125. If that would have happened then you would have had a recession, depression like we've had in the past when that happened.”","analysis":"The president has little power to move prices at the gas pump in any direction because they depend on market forces beyond his control. A variety of market factors has contributed to the falling price of gasoline. Trump's suggestion that prices fell because of phone calls to foreign leaders in oil-rich countries is a fallacy.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"27014, 26100, 25368, 24568, 20865, 22191, 7827, 8020, 7966, 7950, 7871","repeated_count":"11","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
