Trump often claims he saved family farms and small businesses by gradually reducing the federal estate tax. (It was not fully eliminated.) Reducing the estate tax primarily benefits the wealthy. The estate tax rarely falls on farms or small businesses, since only those leaving behind more than $5 million pay it. According to the Tax Policy Center, nearly 5,500 estates in 2017 — out of nearly 3 million — were subject to the tax. Of those, only 80 taxable estates would be farms and small businesses.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"29210, 25753, 26071, 25278, 24425, 23659, 21982, 19308, 17815, 17591, 18403, 17446, 17521, 18319, 16858, 16710, 16544, 13688, 11070, 10471, 10867, 10243, 9965, 9992, 9671, 9520, 8616, 7826, 7363, 6937, 6679, 6039, 6193, 6360, 6470, 5374, 5849, 4912, 4715, 4553, 4291, 4107, 4156, 4073, 4007, 4024, 3943, 2022, 1817, 1815, 1718, 1246, 1258","repeated_count":"53","date":"10/27/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
