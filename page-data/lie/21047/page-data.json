We'll be at 300, think of that, 300 judges, probably a little bit more, and two Supreme Court judges.”","analysis":"Through July 1, 2020, 200 Article III  judges nominated by Trump have been confirmed by the Senate. (That is still second to Jimmy Carter, who had 247 judges confirmed at that point in his term.) George Washington appointed 39 judges during his presidency. Trump appointed 53 judges to the federal appeals court, just short of Carter's 54 as of July 1. He is not likely to hit 300 appointments by the end of his term.
