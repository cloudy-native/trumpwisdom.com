Others ended in ashes!”","analysis":"The rough transcript of the call does suggest pressure, especially when Trump asks for a favor before mentioning an investigation into the DNC server and the Bidens. Diplomatic text messages also underscore what Ukrainian officials were told to expect about the nature of the call, with an implied understanding the government would launch investigations. The Ukrainian president, moreover, faces a dilemma in discussing what he thought about the call. He does not want to get on Trump's bad side -- and he does not want to appear weak back home. So his comments -- and those of the Ukrainian foreign minister -- must be viewed with skepticism.
