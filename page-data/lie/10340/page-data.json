We made a great deal with South Korea. That was the deal made by Hillary Clinton. It was a horrible deal. She said it's going to produce 250,000 jobs, and it did, for South Korea.

You could've never done it.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to a free-trade agreement with South Korea that was negotiated by the President George W. Bush’s administration and then tweaked by President Barack Obama’s; Hillary Clinton did not negotiate it.

But even that's a dubious number disputed by mainstream economists.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"30060, 29110, 28783, 24765, 24088, 23999, 23275, 23068, 22063, 22602, 20038, 18859, 19526, 18472, 17245, 18278, 16335, 15696, 14062, 10340, 6211, 5437, 5365, 5366, 5823, 5224, 5242, 4819, 4842, 4844, 4942, 4762, 4601, 2747, 2860, 1685","repeated_count":"36","date":"05/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
