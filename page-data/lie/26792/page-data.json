Every week there's a new form of information coming out. So I think we had the largest audience anywhere in the world, but they showed this field. Now when I was speaking, it was full. But when they show the field, it was all empty. I said, wait a minute, I was speaking, it was full, they took the pictures about five or six hours early. They had everything roped off. And I said to my people, We to sort of bring that up everyone to, oh, sir, nobody cares about. I care about it. I care about it. No, they took the pictures way early. And when I was speaking, I'm looking at this thing all the way back. It was so beautiful and then all of a sudden we made the statement, I guess the largest audience.
