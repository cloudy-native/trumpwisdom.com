Maybe to a lesser extent, believe or not, children. Women are tied up. They're bound. Duct tape put around their faces, around their mouths. In many cases, they can't even breathe. They're put in the backs of cars or vans or trucks. They don't go through your port of entry. They make a right turn going very quickly. They go into the desert areas, or whatever areas you can look at. And as soon as there's no protection, they make a left or a right into the United States of America. There's nobody to catch them. There's nobody to find them. They can't come through the port, because if they come through the port, people will see four women sitting in a van with tape around their face and around their mouth.”","analysis":"Mentioning women trafficked with tape over their mouths has become a standard part of Trump’s talking points on the need for a border wall. But human-trafficking experts and advocates for immigrant women have said they are perplexed by this tale in Trump’s repertoire — and are at a loss for where he got his information. No prominent news reports have detailed a case that matches the president’s description. (The New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/border-mexico-women.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytpolitics\">reported</a> on March 1 it had found some instances of women being duct-taped and trafficked across the border, but “If the president was suggesting that such savagery occurs daily on America’s southern border, then he was indeed exaggerating.”)","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"24554, 24149, 21279, 13707, 10886, 8968, 8826, 8791, 8488, 8387, 7841, 7842, 7840, 7839, 8255, 7837, 7838, 7972","repeated_count":"18","date":"01/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
