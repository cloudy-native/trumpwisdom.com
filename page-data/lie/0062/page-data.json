Because we shouldn't have been in Iraq, but we shouldn't have gotten out the way we got out. It created a vacuum. ISIS was formed.”","analysis":"This is false and facile. The terrorist group is the direct result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, which Trump had supported.  The civil war that started in Syria in 2011 breathed new life into what had become a moribund organization. The conflict in Syria created a perfect vacuum in terms of governance, and so the civil war became an opportunity for the restoration of the organization. ISIS then saw opportunity to rebound in Iraq. One factor was the withdrawal of U.S. troops. But there was also rampant mismanagement by the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, which greatly degraded the Iraqi military and exacerbated tensions between Sunnis and Shiites.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/06/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
