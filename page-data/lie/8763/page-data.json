Our country had so much money they had to debate what the hell to do with all the money because tariffs were bringing in a fortune into the United States.”","analysis":"Trump offers a very sunny version of what happened when tariffs were increased after Democrats and Republicans argued over the issue in the 1888 election, with Democrats calling for lower tariffs and Republicans pushing for higher ones when the government was running surpluses. The Republicans won the election and increased tariffs, but Americans were not happy with the sharp increase in prices and the party lost its majority in 1890. Tariffs were reduced in 1894.
