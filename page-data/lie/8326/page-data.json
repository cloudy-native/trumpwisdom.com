And when you say '12 injured,' nobody knows how badly injured they are. This isn't like they had a headache. This is big, big, and horrible problems. Loss of legs and arms, and worse. And this man brought in many people -- many, many people -- through chain migration, it's called.”","analysis":"Trump says terror suspect Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov brought 22 relatives into the United States through \"chain migration\" or the diversity visa lottery. But no agency has confirmed this figure and experts say it is implausible because Saipov only had a green card, meaning he could only bring in his wife (already in the U.S.) or his minor children (already U.S. citizens). No one lost an arm, though one victim lost both legs.
