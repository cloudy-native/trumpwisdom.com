If you look, just over the last few months: two elections in North Carolina I won; I helped the governor of Kentucky. I mean, the press doesn't write it, but they went up, supposedly, 17, 18, 19 points because of my -- he lost by just a little bit. But I lifted him 19 points. In Louisiana, I got them into a runoff. And after getting them into a runoff, he picked up 14 points because they thought he was going to lose to a popular governor -- John Bel Edwards. Good guy. Popular governor. He almost won. He lost by less than a point. But with the exception of those two races, where I had a huge impact because I raised them up almost to victory and they had no chance -- with the exception of those two, I've won virtually every race that I've participated in.”","analysis":"These are strange boasts. Republicans already held both House seats in North Carolina and were widely expected to retain them. The Republican in Kentucky lost despite Trump's efforts; so did the Republican candidates running for governor in Louisiana. There's no evidence that Trump's rallies or endorsements led to these huge spikes in support he mentions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
