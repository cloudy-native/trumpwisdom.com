We've picked up over $140 billion of additional money, and we look like we're going to have at least another $100 billion more in spending by the nations -- the 28 nations. We're going to have -- and that's exclusive of the United States. We'll have another $100 billion more by 2020 or a little bit into 2020.”","analysis":"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said last summer that NATO allies had spent $41 billion more toward defense since Trump took office. He said in an interview with Fox News on Jan. 27 that NATO allies will have added $100 billion extra toward defense by the end of 2020. But the effort to push NATO members to spend more on defense began well before Trump took office. At the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, the Obama administration secured an agreement by member nations to aim to increase their spending on defense to 2 percent of each nation’s gross domestic product within 10 years. In any case, the money would not be going to the United States or even necessarily to NATO; this is money that countries would spend to bolster their own military, which in turn supports all of NATO.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"22894, 21863, 22800, 22744, 22680, 20561, 19704, 17336, 16131, 14590, 15786, 15005, 15026, 14001, 13919, 13617, 13565, 12703, 12564, 12394, 11563, 12100, 11986, 11460, 11836, 11215, 11761, 11121, 10908, 10910, 10697, 10478, 10552, 10897, 10349, 9877, 9636, 9640, 9285, 9027, 8997, 8635, 6407, 4587","repeated_count":"44","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
