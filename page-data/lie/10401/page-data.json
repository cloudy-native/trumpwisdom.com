Just sit back and watch! In the meantime, China should not renegotiate deals with the U.S. at the last minute. This is not the Obama Administration, or the Administration of Sleepy Joe, who let China get away with 'murder!'”","analysis":"There is no evidence for this claim. Tariffs are a tax on Americans and ultimately would slow economic growth, in contrast to the growth generated by free trade.Economist Greg Daco at Oxford Economics estimates that the tariffs in place since 2018 depressed U.S. gross domestic product by about 0.1 percentage point in 2019. The higher tariffs would push U.S. GDP below 2 percent and dampen employment growth by about 200,000 jobs, according to Daco’s estimates.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
