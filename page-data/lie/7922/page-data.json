And remember this: the coyotes. These are -- these are bad ones. The coyotes. They're not stupid. They know our laws better than the people that wrote them. The coyotes are using children to gain access into this country. They're using these children. They're not with families. They're using the children. They're taking the children. And then they dispose of the children after they're done.”","analysis":"The Border Patrol refers 50 cases a day on average to medical providers. That's roughly equivalent to 3 percent of all adults and minors apprehended at the border, using December data. CBP attributed these cases of sickness to the flu season and the stresses of the journey. Trump's claim that coyotes are using children to enter the United States, \"and then they dispose of the children,\" distorts and confuses the issue. Coyotes do operate along the border. But Trump suggests they pose as parents or legal guardians to gain admission to the United States. It is well established that thousands of Central American families are trying to immigrate and that thousands of unaccompanied children are also apprehended at the southern border each month. Border officials screen for false claims of parentage.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
