How about when they asked these two Never Trumpers, 'What exactly do you think you impeach him for?' And they stood there, went like, 'What?' But they're unraveling and their sinister plans will fail.”","analysis":"Trump is omitting a key part of what happened. Rep. John Ratcliffe asked: “Are either of you here today to assert there was an impeachable offense in that call? Shout it out. Anyone?\" Both William Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, stayed silent briefly but when Taylor tried to respond, Ratcliffe cut him off, saying he only had a minute left for questioning and then he withdrew the question. Taylor answered anyway, saying he was there only to provide facts. \"I'm not here to take one side or the other. That's your decision,\" he said. Both men have decades of service as nonpartisan career public servants working for presidents of both parties.
