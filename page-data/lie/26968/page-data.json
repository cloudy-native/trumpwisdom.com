Because the swine flu was not nearly as lethal as the novel coronavirus, there was not nearly as much need to halt its spread.  Since fewer precautions were taken to prevent infections, it’s misleading to calculate what the deaths would have been had the virus been more deadly. Even with 60 million infections, there were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates/april_march_13.htm\">an estimated 12,500 deaths</a>.

The death toll at the time was much lower.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
