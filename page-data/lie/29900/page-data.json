Democrats in the House have actually passed a substantial economic-relief bill that the GOP majority in the Senate has refused to consider. If Democrats truly wanted to hurt the economy to enhance their chances of victory in the November election, they would not be pressing for more action. Similarly, Trump falsely says Democratic governors will lift an coronavirus restrictions the day after Election Day because they are only trying to thwart his re-election. That did not happen, as covid-19 cases kept soaring.
