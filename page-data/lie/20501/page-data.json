But what it also shows -- by doing that, in all fairness, it shows a very, very low mortality rate. Just about the lowest. So we're right at the bottom, in a positive way. And I think that people are starting to see it.”","analysis":"This is false. Nearly 40 Americans have died of covid-19 per 100,000 people, second worst in the world behind only the United Kingdom of the 20 countries most affected by the virus, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">according to a covid-19 website maintained by Johns Hopkins University</a>. The United States’ case fatality ratio is 4.4%, ranking seventh worst out of the 20 countries most affected by the virus. Mortality attributed to covid-19 has declined in recent months, though not \"tenfold\" as Trump sometimes claims, and many experts expect to begin to increase again as cases climb.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"24923, 24838, 24151, 24103, 24014, 23868, 23336, 23691, 23383, 23497, 21808, 21698, 20818, 20819, 21485, 21606, 21086, 21159, 20873, 20704, 20724, 20683, 20712, 20660, 20668, 20669, 20639, 20642, 20501, 20553, 20566, 20572","repeated_count":"32","date":"06/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
