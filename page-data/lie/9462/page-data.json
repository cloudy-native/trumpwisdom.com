KEEP AMERICA GREAT!”","analysis":"Attorney General William Barr's summary on the special counsel's report stated: \"The Special Counsel’s report states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.'  The special counsel revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The special counsel concluded Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons associated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. But the summary said the investigation \"did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\" The special counsel defined “coordination” as an “agreement — tacit or express — between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/24/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
