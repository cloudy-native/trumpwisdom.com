The unemployment rate had declined, before the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, but had not achieved record lows under Trump. (The unemployment rate has only been consistently recorded since 1948.) Sometimes, Trump refers to an average unemployment rate over the course of a presidency, but while before the coronavirus pandemic struck, he was off to a good start, his overall record was spoiled in his last year.
