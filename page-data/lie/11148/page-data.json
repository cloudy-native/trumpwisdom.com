Last month a Democrat Pollster said President Trump’s approval rating has been the most steady of any President in history!” @OANN”","analysis":"Trump cited a daily tracking poll for June 15 that found he had a 48 percent approval rating by Rasmussen, which consistently has a Republican-leaning bias. The polling gurus at FiveThirtyEight say that an adjusted rating would have shown Trump at 42 percent in the poll. On the day of the tweet, Trump had an average approval of 42.4 percent in 538's blended poll rating, along with 52.8 percent disapproval. Every president since Carter had polled higher at this point in their presidency.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"28021, 28137, 28281, 27049, 24988, 25134, 24708, 24589, 24162, 22040, 21007, 21543, 22136, 21343, 21760, 21383, 21375, 17861, 16957, 16988, 16602, 16060, 15896, 15017, 15761, 15627, 14218, 13760, 13196, 12807, 12813, 12924, 11473, 11148, 11008, 10315, 10124, 9914, 9664, 9480, 9307, 8913, 8812, 8858, 8676, 8683, 8708, 8606, 7267, 7545, 7006, 5561, 5317, 4738, 2726, 2685, 2625, 2281, 1870, 1492, 0662, 0667, 0665, 0087","repeated_count":"64","date":"06/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
