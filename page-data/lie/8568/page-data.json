You can't bring women or children through a port of entry, where you have people looking into the back of a car or a van, a truck. It has to go out into the open areas, where they drive into our country like there's no problem, and that's exactly what they do. They get off the main drag, or the main road. They make a right, or a left, and then they come right into our country. They go through areas where there is nobody.”","analysis":"Trump depicts a movie fantasy here. With false passports and other documents, people are smuggled through legal points of entry, including airports. Justice Department news releases announcing convictions of sex traffickers often note how they thwarted checks at legal points of entry, such as obtaining fraudulent visas and travel documents by funding false bank accounts and creating fictitious backgrounds and occupations. Even people who make the long trek through Mexico with a smuggler often cross the border hidden in an 18-wheel truck, crammed with dozens of other people.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
