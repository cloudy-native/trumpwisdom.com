In terms of assembly plants, his comment is a stretch. Nine years ago a new assembly plant opened in Tennessee. In 2015, Volvo announced it would build a plant in South Carolina and opened it in 2019. So it hasn't been \"decades.\" Two other plants are underway.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/30/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
