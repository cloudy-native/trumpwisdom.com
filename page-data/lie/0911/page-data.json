I just thought it was an incredible statistic. Totally true – and you have seen the same thing. It is incredible.”","analysis":"Trump, in a phone call with the Australian prime minister, is wrong to claim that there is \"no chance\" for Syrian Christians to become refugees in the United States. While a relatively small percentage of Syrian refugees have been admitted, the experience of Iraqi refugees is exactly the opposite, even though the same U.N. agency handles the refugee requests. No one fully understands why there is such a disparity, though it appears connected to the roots the Syrians have with Lebanon, as Syrian Christian refugees are more likely to settle with relatives in Lebanon.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/27/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
