Now he finds out I'm right. Those fires in California, there's no reason to have them. The floors of the forests are filthy, dirty, meaning feet of leaves and fallen timber. You know, when a tree falls, if it's there for more than 18 months, it becomes like a matchstick. OK, it's dry. Dead, bone dry and the leaves underneath are bone dry in some cases for years. When you start, one little fire, it goes up, the whole thing goes up. If they would clean that out, you wouldn't have fires. You would have very few fires. I mean, you have cities that are called forest cities, there in forests in Europe. You take a look at, they have forest countries. You have countries that are in the mountains. They don't have anything like this and they have more flammable lumber of the type that California has, but more flammable than that, more inclined to burn.”","analysis":"Half of the forested land in California is managed by the federal government, and those officials out of necessity have diverted forest management funds to deal with the rash of wildfires. In any event, experts say the most recent wildfires besetting California were not sparked by forest management problems such as an overpopulation of trees or a lack of raking. “The ones in Southern California are burning in chaparral, so it’s not a forest management issue at all,” LeRoy Westerling, a climate and fire researcher at the University of California at Merced, told us. “The fire in Northern California didn’t start in forest; it started in other types of vegetation, from what I read. … There, you're talking about what kind of vegetation people manage on their homes on private properties.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"26991, 27314, 25360, 25166, 26006, 24729, 24183, 24261, 24124, 24138, 24144, 24146, 24035, 23987, 20985, 17451, 14783, 14154, 14263, 12161, 11078, 10474, 8033, 7302, 7233, 7484, 6114, 4266, 4267","repeated_count":"29","date":"11/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
