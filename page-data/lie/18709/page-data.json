She wanted to go, 'Let's go out and party.' That was late into February.”","analysis":"Under fire for reacting too slowly to the coronavirus pandemic, Trump tried to turn the tables and repeatedly argue Pelosi was actually slower than he was, citing a visit Pelosi made to San Francisco’s Chinatown on Feb. 24. Trump claimed Pelosi deleted a tweet with a video of the visit; that’s false. There was no such tweet, and her video tweet of her visit is still on her timeline. He accused her of causing many deaths, when there have been none in Chinatown and relatively few in San Francisco. He says she urged street fairs and parades, but that’s not true. She advocated patronage of Chinese businesses. In terms of suggesting he took the crisis seriously and she did not, that’s a stretch. Contrary to Trump’s claim, she never suggested the virus did not exist. In Chinatown, she urged people to take precautions and to be vigilant. A day later, she called for a broader, more forceful response. The president, meanwhile, continued with happy talk for at least two weeks afterward.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28059, 26938, 25479, 24225, 24076, 23294, 22635, 21081, 21162, 20495, 20438, 19943, 19259, 18869, 19604, 19631, 19572, 18750, 19256, 18709, 19231, 18650, 19532, 19518, 18689, 18644, 19184","repeated_count":"27","date":"04/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
