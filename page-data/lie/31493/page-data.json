That was before what you see right here [gestures at border wall], because it was easier to come into our country through the southern border than it was through airports or any other means. … These are people from some very seriously dangerous places in the Middle East. And the numbers are far greater than anybody would understand.”","analysis":"The Trump administration first asserted this in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, offering a range of misleading statistics to buttress the claim that terrorists from the Middle East were filtering through the U.S.-Mexico border. But administration officials <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/14/guide-understanding-administrations-spin-terrorists-border/\">never offered any proof or identified a single terrorist</a>. In reports issued during the Trump administration, the State Department said that there was “no credible evidence indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into the United States” and that “there have been no cases of terrorist groups exploiting these gaps to move operations through the region.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31493, 27510, 7981, 8210, 7718, 7646, 7478, 7276","repeated_count":"8","date":"01/12/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
