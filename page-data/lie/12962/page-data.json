But we're having a lot of wins at the WTO since I became President....Your wins are now, because they think I don't like the WTO, and they want to make sure I'm happy. Because all of those countries were ripping off the United States for many years. They know that I'm wise to it. We've had a lot of wins....The WTO has been much better to us since I've been President because they understand they can't get away with what they've been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States.”","analysis":"The case (against Airbus) was brought by a previous administration. Contrary to Trump's claim, the United States has prevailed in about 90 percent of the cases that it brings against other countries in the World Trade Organization. The U.S. tends to lose when other countries bring cases to the WTO.\n\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"30504, 29674, 28113, 26462, 25562, 25431, 25391, 23411, 18645, 19208, 19147, 17512, 16754, 15782, 15684, 14667, 13966, 13474, 12962, 12304, 7423, 4600, 2991, 2953, 2756, 1529","repeated_count":"26","date":"10/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
