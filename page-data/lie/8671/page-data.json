Richard Burr said the Senate Intelligence Committee has not found evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, but he went on to say that the investigation continues. Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the committee, has disputed Burr's statements and indicated there is plenty of evidence, such as all the documented contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians. It's important to keep in mind that the Senate Intelligence Committee is not investigating potential crimes related to Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating those crimes, and he has yet to announce any conclusions on whether Trump's campaign illegally coordinated with a foreign power to influence the election.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"10393, 10545, 9214, 9050, 8893, 8916, 8805, 8690, 8732, 8662, 8671, 8646, 8648, 8654, 6451, 6086, 5392, 5667","repeated_count":"18","date":"02/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
