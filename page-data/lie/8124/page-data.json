In the 11-month period through August 2018, U.S. Customs and Border Protection encountered 16,831 people convicted of crimes in the United States or abroad, but 63 percent of them showed up at ports of entry. That includes airport travelers, not just people “trying to cross the Border.” The number includes a mix of violent and nonviolent offenses. A CBP breakdown shows that 46.5 percent of all the convictions (not arrests) were for illegal entry or reentry.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
