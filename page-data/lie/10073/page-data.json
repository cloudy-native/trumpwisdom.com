Watch out for people that take so-called ‘notes,’ when the notes never existed until needed.”","analysis":"Trump is lashing out at his former White House counsel, Donald McGahn, who took notes and whose aide took notes of his interactions with Trump. The Mueller report says the notes were contemporaneously written, not after the fact as Trump claims. McGahn was a key witness for Mueller's investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice. According to McGahn's testimony as laid out in the Mueller report, Trump directed McGahn to have Mueller removed. McGahn refused. Trump later told McGahn he never asked him to fire Mueller. That was false, according to the Mueller report. Trump often criticizes Mueller's team as 13 (or now, 18) angry Democrats. It's not clear to whom he's referring and what evidence he has, if any. Eleven members of Mueller's team previously had made financial contributions to Democrats' campaigns, including those of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Mueller, a Republican, could not legally take political party affiliation into account in hiring decisions.
