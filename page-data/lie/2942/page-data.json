He takes $700,000 for his wife's campaign. And by the way, didn't even spend that money. They kept some of it because under that law you're -- he took seven. He took $700,000 from a group headed by Terry McAuliffe who was under investigation by McCabe and the FBI and that investigation disappeared. He took $700,000.”","analysis":"The question of fired deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe’s wife’s political activities emerged during the campaign, and Trump constantly has gotten the details incorrect. In this quote, Trump added the unfounded claim that McCabe kept some of this money. On March 12, 2015, Jill McCabe, a hospital physician, announced her candidacy for the Virginia Senate. The political action committee of then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a close Clinton ally, gave $452,500 to McCabe, and the state Democratic Party gave her campaign $207,788. That was about one-third of the $1.8 million budget for her campaign. All of the money was spent and there is no evidence McCabe kept any of it. He did not participate in his wife’s campaign.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"25374, 24024, 23775, 12038, 9580, 8894, 8807, 6076, 4334, 3129, 2987, 2942, 2728, 2577, 2321, 1940, 1944, 1678, 0929, 0866, 0830","repeated_count":"21","date":"04/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
