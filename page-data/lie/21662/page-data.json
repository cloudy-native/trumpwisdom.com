They send the cars in, there's no tax. We send a car to them, they say, we don't take your cars you know. This is the kind of thing that we've put up with. We defend these countries, we get nothing for it. And you know, I've ended a lot of the craziness that's gone on.”","analysis":"The E.U. is the largest export market for the United States, and those exports supported an estimated 2.6 million U.S. jobs in 2015, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The United States runs a trade deficit with the E.U. when looking only at goods, and runs a trade surplus of about $60 billion when looking only at services. Combined, the U.S. goods and services trade deficit with the E.U. was $109 billion in 2018. International trade works in such a way that some countries dominate some markets and don't compete as much in others.
