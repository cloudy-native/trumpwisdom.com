Joseph Dunford, the top U.S. military commander, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/14/politics/dunford-china-google/index.html\">testified</a> in a Senate hearing that \"the work that Google is doing in China is indirectly benefiting the Chinese military ... and frankly indirect may be not a full characterization of the way it really is, it's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military.\" Dunford did not specify what kind of direct or indirect benefit Google is providing to China. The company has limited operations in China but has been reported to be pursuing a censored search engine in that country, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gizmodo.com/trump-now-just-accusing-google-of-aiding-the-chinese-mi-1833350917\">according to Gizmodo</a>. An anonymous Google spokesperson released a statement saying, \"We are not working with the Chinese military.\" With all that aside, what's worth fact-checking in this Trump tweet is the unfounded claim that Google helped Clinton and not Trump in the 2016 election.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
