It's a great name to me and if somebody is terminally ill and we have a drug that looks really promising and they're not allowed to use it because they're afraid it's going to make the person sick. I said the person is going to die, but not that easy because you had the drug companies, they didn't want to take the liability and the country didn't want to take the liability. The drug companies as an example, they didn't want to have it on their records because if somebody is that sick and it looks bad on their records. The person didn't make it. So I said what we'll do is we'll set up a different sheet, we'll set up a different sheet, and maybe we won't even count it if somebody is so sick. And then, of course, you had the insurance companies, they hated the idea and we got them in a room and we had somebody. We had a very strong document that there will be no liability to the country and you have an absolute right to try. So if somebody is terminally ill, you have no idea how many people have been saved by doing this, some incredible stories.”","analysis":"Right to Try wasn't a protracted battle — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2018/03/07/right-to-try-movement-washington/\">the idea emerged in 2013</a>.
