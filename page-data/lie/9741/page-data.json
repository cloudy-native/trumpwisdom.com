The special counsel concluded Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons associated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. The special counsel's report, released in April 2019, concluded the Trump campaign welcomed the assistance from Russia even if it did not coordinate with it:  “Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” The report also stated: “If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"31168, 31089, 30796, 30775, 29791, 29861, 30256, 30452, 30458, 27105, 24027, 23834, 23338, 23567, 22337, 22944, 21707, 22743, 21740, 22665, 21666, 21639, 21172, 20486, 20508, 19845, 20335, 19344, 19786, 19757, 19770, 18985, 18871, 19429, 18963, 19713, 19648, 19606, 19609, 19315, 19565, 19545, 19540, 19482, 18573, 17559, 17108, 16966, 17433, 17470, 17180, 16618, 16685, 16582, 16461, 16305, 15975, 16018, 15225, 15407, 14579, 15775, 14916, 14830, 15729, 15364, 15365, 15565, 14964, 15480, 15491, 14299, 14356, 14373, 14028, 14612, 13928, 15076, 13765, 13790, 13844, 12399, 13135, 13189, 13499, 13710, 12994, 12973, 12361, 11179, 11693, 11051, 11667, 11648, 11655, 11347, 12150, 12083, 12120, 11325, 12015, 12004, 11310, 11305, 11267, 11294, 11161, 11168, 11771, 11762, 11086, 11099, 11732, 10920, 10804, 10652, 10563, 10564, 10575, 10936, 10362, 10364, 10369, 10329, 10347, 10348, 10077, 9689, 9917, 9741, 9742, 9782, 9624, 9595, 9485, 9618, 9621, 9424, 9442, 9313, 9278, 9238, 9174, 9200, 9201, 9204, 9267, 8931, 9082, 9037, 8880, 8899, 8649, 8469, 8400, 8348, 8507, 8017, 8141, 7711, 7282, 7621, 7549, 7428, 7548, 7588, 6582, 6624, 6627, 6632, 6540, 7494, 7498, 7210, 7212, 7005, 7449, 7450, 7457, 6683, 5940, 5948, 6102, 6073, 5394, 5717, 5718, 5184, 5655, 5044, 5650, 5651, 5041, 5968, 4777, 4986, 4758, 4683, 4508, 4459, 4489, 4491, 4493, 4577, 4625, 4480, 4481, 4475, 4478, 4381, 4345, 4466, 4468, 4338, 4283, 4332, 4275, 4529, 3878, 3788, 3802, 3784, 3785, 3790, 4219, 4184, 4185, 4138, 4088, 4089, 4071, 4035, 4036, 3427, 3818, 3423, 3504, 3327, 3176, 3243, 3179, 3229, 3232, 3222, 3226, 3227, 3228, 3209, 2813, 0363","repeated_count":"250","date":"04/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
