And it would have opened in 25 years. But I said to our great Ambassador, David Friedman, one of the most successful lawyers in New York, he became Ambassador at Israel. I said, 'David, they want to spend $1.1 billion, we can do it cheaper. They want to buy this piece of land in Jerusalem, top dollar.' I said, 'David, what can we do?' And he called me back, he said, 'Sir, we have a piece of land that's much better. And on that piece of land, we have an old building, and we're not using the building very much. And we can renovate the building for $400,000. And we'll have a beautiful Embassy in a better location. And we can have it done -- and sir, we can have it done in four months, instead of 25 years.' So here's your alternative, a building in a great location in four months, for $400,000, or a building that will probably never get built, but let's say 20 years, for $1.1 billion today, meaning $3 billion to $4 billion in a lousy location. That won't be as good as what we build. And it's the first time I've ever done this. He said $400,000. I said, 'David, it's too cheap. We have to make it more.' It's true. I said, 'Make it $500,000.'”","analysis":"The new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem for about $400,000. (Trump sometimes claims it cost $500,000.) U.S. government documents <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/67072609\">show</a> the overall cost for the conversion now totals more than $23 million. Costs for the permanent embassy could well surpass $1 billion when all is said and done.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"04/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
