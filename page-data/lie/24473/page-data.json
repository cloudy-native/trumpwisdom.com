LAW & ORDER!”","analysis":"Antifa is not a single group with a clear organizational structure or leader. It is a decentralized network of activists who don’t coordinate. Their common ground is opposing anything that they think is racist or fascist. In recent years, antifa activists appeared whenever there was a large gathering of white nationalists. Starting on May 30 — five days after George Floyd was killed and four after protests erupted across Minneapolis — President Trump first said antifa forces were behind the violence that swept across the country. The Fact Checker video team <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/06/22/who-caused-violence-protests-its-not-antifa/\">spoke to witnesses</a> and reviewed arrest records, federal charges, intelligence reports, online conversations and dozens of videos and photos of violent incidents from the early days of protests in Minneapolis to determine whether a coordinated antifa campaign was responsible for the violence. It turned out there has not yet been a single confirmed case in which someone who self-identifies as antifa led violent acts at any of the protests across the country. The president and his administration placed an outsize burden of blame on antifa, without waiting for arrest data and completed investigations.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"26736, 27370, 25625, 25627, 25228, 25280, 26534, 26597, 24503, 24473, 23101, 21272, 19904, 20138, 19855, 20318, 20368, 19823, 19830, 19841, 19837, 19839, 19808, 19810, 19812","repeated_count":"25","date":"09/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
