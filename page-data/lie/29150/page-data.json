First of all, they have different ways of counting. You know, in Germany, if you have a bad heart and you're ready to die, or if you have cancer and you're going to be dying soon and you catch COVID that happens. We mark it down to COVID. You know, our doctors get more money if somebody dies from COVID. You know that right? I mean, our doctors are very smart people. So what they do is they say, 'I'm sorry, but, you know, everybody dies of COVID.' But in Germany and other places if you have a heart attack or if you have cancer, you're terminally ill, you catch COVID, they say you died of cancer. You died of heart attack. With us, when in doubt, choose COVID. It's true. No, it's true.”","analysis":"Germany's initial success in combating the pandemic, which won wide praise, apparently gnaws at Trump. But he has the story backwards. Germany records any death related to covid-19 as a covid death, while the United States does not have such strict guidance. \"Italy counts any death of a patient who has Covid-19 as a death caused by Covid-19; so does Germany and Hong Kong,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200401-coronavirus-why-death-and-mortality-rates-differ\">reported the BBC</a>. \"In the US, doctors have more discretion: they are asked to record whether the patient died “as a result of this illness” when reporting Covid-19 deaths <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/COVID-19-Persons-Under-Investigation-and-Case-Report-Form-Instructions.pdf\">to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. It could be easy to see how a physician might believe that a Covid-19 patient who died of, say, a heart attack or brain aneurysm didn't die as a result of Covid-19, and so wouldn't report accordingly.\" (The CDC, however, in its covid death counts is including any case that has a covid as contributing factor.)
