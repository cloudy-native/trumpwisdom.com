Republicans ended up with a 53-seat majority in the Senate. But no matter which way you slice it, Trump's statement is false. Republicans had a 55-seat majority in the Senate from 1997 to 2000 and from 2005 to 2006, according to the Senate Historian’s office. From 1921 to 1927, Republicans held 59, 53 and 54 seats — when the Senate only had 96 seats. (Alaska and Hawaii were not yet states.) Republicans thus represented more than 55 percent of the body in each of those two-year sessions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
