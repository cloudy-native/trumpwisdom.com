But the House Judiciary Committee’s report on Trump and Ukraine says that the first article of impeachment includes a charge of attempted bribery. “President Trump’s abuse of power encompassed impeachable ‘bribery’ and violations of federal criminal law,” the report says. The House intelligence committee’s report says Trump “personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection.” (Requesting foreign assistance in U.S. elections is a crime.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"18215, 17086, 16611, 16605, 16177, 16675, 16092, 16028, 16382, 16420, 16309, 15904, 15980, 15863, 15926, 15243, 14578, 11340, 11450, 11103, 10809, 10810, 10750, 10796, 10674, 10391, 10085","repeated_count":"27","date":"01/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
