Possibly he is referring to 11,000 inaccurate pre-filled voter registration applications — not ballots —that were sent to North Carolinians from Civitech, a technology vendor that works with companies and campaigns to increase voter registrations, the North Carolina State Board of Elections said in an Oct. 6 press release. Civitech apologized and promised to send out “corrected mailers with blank applications to all affected NC recipients.” Alternatively, a more specific case occurred in 2018, when <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/419979-over-a-thousand-absentee-ballots-possibly-destroyed-in-controversial-north\">1,000 completed ballots</a> in North Carolina were allegedly destroyed — but that was part of an apparent electoral fraud effort conducted on behalf of a Republican congressional candidate.
