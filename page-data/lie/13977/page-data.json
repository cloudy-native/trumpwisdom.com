That’s true. Because we want to help Saudi Arabia. They have been a very good ally. They've agreed to pay for the cost of those troops. They've agreed to pay fully for the cost of everything we're doing over there. That’s something you have never heard before, I think, as long as you’ve been standing out there. I think you -- the media has never heard that before. But Saudi Arabia has graciously agreed to pay for the full cost of everything we're doing for them.”","analysis":"Trump keeps claiming that the Saudi government is paying 100 percent of the cost of 3,000 troops, along with about four dozen Air Force fighters and Patriot anti missile batteries, being sent to the kingdom in response to attacks on Saudi oil facilities that U.S. officials blame on Iran. But no one in the administration will confirm this, and State Department and Defense Department officials say that they are negotiating \"burden-sharing\" with the Saudis. In the past, this has meant the Saudis agreed to pay for building barracks and other infrastructure for Prince Sultan Air Base, but not that they would reimburse the United States for the expense of troops. The Saudis have been slow in repaying $181 million owed for midair refueling assistance for its bombing runs over Yemen.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"15803, 14209, 13977, 14012, 15051","repeated_count":"5","date":"10/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
