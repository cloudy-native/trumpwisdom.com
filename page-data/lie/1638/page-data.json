During his visit, the Vietnamese government says that two airlines would puchase $2.1 billion of engines from Pratt & Whitney. But there was no Boeing announcement. When Obama visited Vietnam in 2016, Boeing inked a deal to sell $11.3 billion of jets to a Vietnamese carrier. If Trump were counting the deal announced under Obama, that would be in keeping with past practice.
