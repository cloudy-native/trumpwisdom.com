And he put a picture of an empty arena. There were tens of thousands of people outside waiting to come in. The Washington Post put a picture of an empty arena, and they put a caption to the effect, ‘Mr. President, not a very good crowd, is it?’ And you know what happened? And when I landed, that place was just like this. It was packed with thousands of people outside. … And we barely got an apology. And he admitted he was wrong. You know where he did it? On his little Twitter account.”","analysis":"A Washington Post reporter tweeted a picture of a Trump rally before it filled up, but when he was alerted, he removed the tweet and apologized to Trump on Twitter. The Post did not publish a story that incorrectly described the crowd size at this Trump event. The picture and apology were both on Twitter.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
