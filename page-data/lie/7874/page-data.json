Our southern border is like a sieve. It just pours through our southern border. And unless we're going to have physical barriers, it's never going to be able to be stopped. Too much money is being made.”","analysis":"The 300-a-week number checks out.  But while 90 percent of the heroin sold in the United States comes from Mexico, virtually all of it comes through legal points of entry. “A small percentage of all heroin seized by [Customs and Border Protection] along the land border was between Ports of Entry (POEs),” the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a 2018 report. So Trump’s wall would do little to halt drug trafficking. Trump’s repeated claim that the wall would stop drug trafficking is a Bottomless Pinocchio claim.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"10100, 8361, 8276, 8045, 7763, 8218, 7874","repeated_count":"7","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
