Trump is mischaracterizing an interview with NPR, in which Biden is quoting his son talking about being on Burisma’s board. “The matter is, my son testified and did an interview saying if he, looking back on it, made a mistake, he made a mistake although he did nothing wrong,” Biden said. “The appearance looked bad and it gave folks like Rudy Giuliani an excuse to come up with a Trumpian kind of defense, why they were violating the Constitution. His, his words speak for themselves.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
