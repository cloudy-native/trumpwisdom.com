Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She’s close to Russia.”","analysis":"Trump’s claim suggests the State Department had sole approval authority on a uranium rights deal with a company largely owned by Russia’s nuclear energy agency. But the State Department is one of nine agencies in the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States to vet and sign off on all U.S. transactions involving foreign governments. As we’ve noted before, there is no evidence Clinton herself got involved in the deal personally, and it is highly questionable that this deal even rose to the level of the secretary of state. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also needed to approve, and did approve, the transfer.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"14920, 4091, 1558, 1329, 1031, 0923, 0857, 0952, 0502, 0332, 0323, 0098","repeated_count":"12","date":"02/16/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
