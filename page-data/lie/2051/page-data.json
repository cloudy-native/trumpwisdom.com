This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?

Get smart!”","analysis":"Trump appeared to tweet against a bill that his administration supported, and two hours later he expressed his support for that bill. The only person affiliated with the campaign known to have surveillance placed on him through a FISA court order is Carter Page. The exact date of the order, which must be approved by a judge, is not clear but some reports say it took place after he resigned from the campaign.
