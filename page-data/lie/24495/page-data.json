That's called ‘solicited.’ When you solicit, when you go out -- it's called absentee or solicit. When you go out and you request a ballot -- you want to say, ‘I want to vote because I can't be in Florida or I can't be someplace.’ You request. So you're sending something in, it's handled professionally, they send it back -- it's a whole thing. That's much different than unsolicited.”","analysis":"A distinction without a difference. “Absentee ballots” and “mail-in ballots” are interchangeable terms. State officials use safeguards such as bar codes and signature matching to ensure the authenticity of all ballots cast by mail. For the purposes of ballot verification, it makes no difference whether someone mailed an absentee ballot or dropped it off in person. It doesn't matter whether a voter had an excuse to vote by mail, such as military service, or not. All voters must identify themselves to register to vote and then submit ballots to local officials for verification. Safety measures to verify their authenticity include signature verification, barcode scanning and in some states, a sworn affidavit signed by a witness.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"24495, 24318, 24141, 24048, 23896, 23008, 23032, 22760, 22763, 22865, 22732, 22564","repeated_count":"12","date":"09/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
