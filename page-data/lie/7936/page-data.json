I gave our generals all the money they wanted. They didn't do such a great job in Afghanistan. They've been fighting in Afghanistan for 19 years. … General Mattis was so thrilled. Well, what's he done for me? How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good. Not too good. I'm not happy with what he's done in Afghanistan. And I shouldn't be happy.”","analysis":"Trump is criticizing Gen. Jim Mattis, who resigned as secretary of defense. But the criticism is that Mattis failed to solve the Afghanistan conflict despite a recent increase in military funding during Trump's presidency. It's a mistake to think of that as an immediate upgrade to U.S. resources, weapons or technology in Afghanistan. Much of the money is going to long-term projects such as ships and weapons that take years to build.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
