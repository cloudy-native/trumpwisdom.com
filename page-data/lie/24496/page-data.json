Some states were mailing ballots to all registered voters, accounting for 51 million voters combined, according to a Washington Post tally. (In California alone, that means 20 million ballots were mailed.) Other states, with a combined 44 million voters, were simply mailing ballot applications. In all of these cases, people had to register to vote before receiving a ballot or ballot application in the mail.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
