She said this will produce 250,000 new jobs, and I said, well, what happened? He said, well, she was right except it was for South Korea, not for us. So it produced 250,000 jobs for South Korea.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to a free-trade agreement with South Korea that was negotiated by President George W. Bush’s administration and then tweaked by President Barack Obama’s. Hillary Clinton did not negotiate it. One of his top trade aides claimed 100,000 U.S. jobs — not 250,000 — would be lost in the deal, but even that’s a dubious number disputed by mainstream economists.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"30060, 29110, 28783, 24765, 24088, 23999, 23275, 23068, 22063, 22602, 20038, 18859, 19526, 18472, 17245, 18278, 16335, 15696, 14062, 10340, 6211, 5437, 5365, 5366, 5823, 5224, 5242, 4819, 4842, 4844, 4942, 4762, 4601, 2747, 2860, 1685","repeated_count":"36","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
