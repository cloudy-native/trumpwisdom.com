That's a drop in the bucket when measured against the 125,000-job loss in this industry since its most recent peak in 1985, or the 36,000-job loss since 2012. U.S. coal consumption in 2018 was at its lowest level in 39 years, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37817\">according to the Energy Information Administration</a>.
