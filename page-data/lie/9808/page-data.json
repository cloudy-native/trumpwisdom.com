They don't have courts like we do. We have a stupid system of courts. It's the craziest thing in the world. We could be the only country that has it. If you put a foot on the property, you put a foot into the United States: ‘Congratulations. Go get Perry Mason to represent you.’ You end up with a court case. And then they release you, and you come back four, five years later but nobody comes back. Two percent come back. The not-so-smart ones come back. It's the most ridiculous system anyone has ever seen.”","analysis":"Mexico decriminalized the act of crossing the border without authorization and instituted a range of protections for migrants' rights in a landmark 2011 law. Experts say it does not have the strongest immigration laws in the world. By contrast, under U.S. law, unauthorized entry is a criminal offense. The president in these comments also falsely characterized the U.S. immigration system. Trump is routinely astonished by the workings of U.S. and international laws on asylum. This is how it works in any country that abides by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees: A refugee enters and makes a petition, and the government makes a ruling after analyzing the facts. It's also worth keeping in mind that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/06/26/president-trumps-misconceptions-about-immigration-courts-and-law/?utm_term=.61c2a2ffa3de\">85 percent</a> of all deportations in the United States are ordered quickly, without a hearing before a judge. People with criminal records can be deported quickly, without a hearing. Most people who get a court date for an immigration hearing show up, according to government statistics.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"11428, 11919, 11829, 11127, 9808, 9818, 9643, 9704, 9623, 9483, 9597, 9603, 9439, 3817, 3549, 3487, 3014, 2682, 2815, 2830, 2690","repeated_count":"21","date":"04/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
