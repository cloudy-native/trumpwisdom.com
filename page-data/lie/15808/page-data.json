If you look at a graph, it was to a point where I don't think they could have gone on much longer. Now it’s actually very strong and getting stronger.”","analysis":"Spending by European NATO and Canada declined 14 percent in constant 2015 dollars from 1989 to 2016, largely because of the end of the Cold War, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2019_11/20191129_pr-2019-123-en.pdf\">according to NATO figures</a>. But the effort to push NATO members to spend more on defense began well before Trump took office. At the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, the Obama administration secured an agreement by member nations to aim to increase their spending on defense to 2 percent of each nation’s gross domestic product within 10 years. Defense spending by NATO countries has increased every year since then, predating Trump's election as president. In any case, the money would not be going to the United States or even necessarily to NATO; this is money that countries would spend to bolster their own military, which in turn supports all of NATO. In constant dollars, European NATO and Canadian spending on defense in 2019 is roughly equal to the level in 1989.
