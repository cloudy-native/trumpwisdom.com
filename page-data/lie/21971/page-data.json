Europe has seen 33 percent more fatalities, compared to a typical non-pandemic year than the United States.”","analysis":"This should not be framed as something positive. The case fatality rate, also known as the death rate, is the percentage of known virus cases that end in death. That percentage is continuing to decline in the USA largely because so many people are getting sick in the country every day, driving the fatality rate down relative to the number of cases. A better metric to determine how the USA is performing relative to other countries when it comes to coronavirus deaths would be to look at the country's coronavirus mortality rate — a per capita figure that lists the number of deaths per 100,000 people who live in a country, both the sick and the well. Under that mesure, the USA is doing much worse than most other countries with high caseloads.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
