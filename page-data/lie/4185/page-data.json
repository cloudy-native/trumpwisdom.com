It’s a Democrat Con Job!”","analysis":"This is a breathtaking compendium of falsehoods and debunked conspiracy theories. There's no evidence that the special counsel investigation is a witch hunt or a hoax. In fact, the special counsel has revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The investigation into potential collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign continues, and no conclusions have been announced. There's also no evidence that the Democrats colluded with Russia. Rather, there's more evidence they were victimized. FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was criticized by the DOJ inspector general for sending anti-Trump text messages in 2016, worked on special counsel Robert Mueller's team for two months in 2017, not a year. Trump also refers to the team of lawyers that Mueller has assembled. Eleven out of 16 attorneys on Mueller's team made public so far have contributed to Democrats, including Clinton and Obama. The other five have no record of political contributions, though the Daily Caller says 13 are registered Democrats. One attorney who donated the maximum amount represented the Clinton Foundation in a 2015 lawsuit. Another attorney without a record of political donations represented a Clinton aide at one point. Both attorneys worked for WilmerHale, a firm that also represents Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, as well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Moreover, under federal law, Mueller is not allowed to consider the political leanings of his staff when hiring them. Mueller himself is a Republican. There’s no evidence Clinton deleted these 33,000 emails in anticipation of receiving a subpoena, and former FBI director James Comey has said the FBI’s investigation found no evidence that any work-related emails were “intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.” Clinton’s staff had requested that these emails be deleted months before they received a subpoena, according to the FBI’s July 2016 statement. \"Pakistani fraudster\" refers to Imran Awan, a naturalized U.S. citizen. The Justice Department has debunked several conspiracy theories fanned by right-wing websites about Awan's work in Congress. The conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton and Uranium One, and about the DNC server, are likewise devoid of evidence.
