It ranks 10th for air quality — but 88th on exposure to particulate matter, an indication of the health effects from pollution — and 29th for water and sanitation. The U.S. is tied for first place — with nine other countries — for the quality of drinking water. As for whether things have improved under Trump, that’s hard to track in the available data -- in fact, the number of unhealthy days in the United States went up from 2016 to 2017, according to government data --but he has taken a number of actions that could reverse or slow the gains made in air and water quality since 1990.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30614, 27011, 26807, 26463, 26206, 23713, 21823, 22688, 21186, 22570, 20281, 17995, 17622, 17207, 16760, 16108, 16188, 16448, 15489, 14046, 13737, 12756, 12934, 13263, 12326, 11338, 11945, 11196, 10308, 10311, 11000, 9945, 7405, 7443, 7028, 6044, 5212, 5965, 5695","repeated_count":"39","date":"06/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
