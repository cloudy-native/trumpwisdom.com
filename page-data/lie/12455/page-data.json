Is there going to be an extension of the license tomorrow?’] No. That was reported. And, actually, it's the opposite. Huawei. Huawei is a company we may not do business with at all. And it was sort of reported, I think the opposite, today -- I was surprised -- that we are open to doing business. We're actually open not to doing business with them. So I don't know who gave the report. Now, they have little sections of Huawei, like furniture and other things that we could do. But when you cut out sections, it gets very complicated: what's being sold, what's coming in. So, at this moment, it looks much more like we're not going to do business. I don't want to do business at all, because it is a national security threat.”","analysis":"This was false.
