I said 20 billion what? $20 billion on a census. They go through houses. They go up, they ring doorbells, they talk to people. How many toilets do they have? How many desks, how many beds, what is their roof made of? The only thing we can't ask is are you a citizen of the United States.”","analysis":"The Supreme Court blocked Trump from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. But the ruling was based on procedural grounds. The court found that the Trump administration did not give the real reason for adding the question, as was required by law. The Commerce Department said it needed to add the question to have better data for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. But that was a false justification, the court called it \"contrived,\" and said adding a citizenship question would be permissible if a genuine reason were given. The question about toilets -- which is actually a question about plumbing -- appears in a supplemental questionnaire called the American Community Survey. The ACS also asks about citizenship, though it stopped asking about toilets after 2015.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
