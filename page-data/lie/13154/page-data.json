He appears to have focused on the fact that he got 8 percent of the black vote vs. 6 percent for Mitt Romney in 2012 and 4 percent for John McCain in 2008. In the polling world, a two- or even four-percentage-point shift is relatively small. Moreover, who was running as a Democrat in 2008 and 2012? The first African American candidate, Barack Obama. Trump was not running against a black man, so that further discounts his claims of a substantial achievement. Strictly by the numbers, Trump actually did worse than any Republican running against a white man, though in effect he came close to tying George W. Bush in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1984.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"30337, 30381, 29835, 29436, 29636, 25369, 25212, 24811, 24385, 24231, 20718, 17193, 15307, 15324, 14258, 14081, 13154, 10055, 7166, 2938, 0170, 0043","repeated_count":"22","date":"10/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
