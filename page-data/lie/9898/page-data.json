The Justice Department negotiated a settlement during President Bill Clinton’s administration — well before the current surge of migrants. According to a 2016 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, the Flores settlement requires the federal government to release rather than detain all undocumented immigrant children, whether they crossed with parents or alone. Regardless, many people migrating to the U.S. are fleeing gang violence in Central America not because of either the Flores settlement or the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.
