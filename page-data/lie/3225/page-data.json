Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D.C.?”","analysis":"It's strange to see Trump calling for the indictment of Tony Podesta, a longtime Democratic lobbyist whose firm closed in 2017. Podesta's lobbying firm <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tony-podesta-a-washington-power-broker-lost-it-all-1524065781\">was investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller</a> for allegedly assisting Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, in his Ukraine-related work. The Podesta Group was identified in Manafort's indictment as \"Company B,\" but Podesta himself was not charged. In calling for Podesta to face charges, Trump could be said to be tacitly acknowledging the legitimacy of Mueller's investigation -- which the president often calls a witch hunt -- and the indictment of his former campaign chairman.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"3225, 2772, 1683, 0924, 0577, 3023","repeated_count":"6","date":"05/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
