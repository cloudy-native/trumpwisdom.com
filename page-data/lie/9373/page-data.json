The press tried to make it 2.9. I said, ‘It’s not 2.9.’ What they did is they took odd months. I said, ‘No, no, no. You go from January to December.

The fake news tried to change it, but we caught them.”’","analysis":"Here is what Trump’s Commerce Department (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis) reported Feb. 28: “Real GDP increased 2.9 percent in 2018 (from the 2017 annual level to the 2018 annual level), compared with an increase of 2.2 percent in 2017.” So the news media was reporting on an actual news release by the U.S. government, not by counting “odd months.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
