Much more than anybody else. You don't hear that we've done well in testing. They always say well why not more and yet Germany is at 3 million -- we're at 16 million. So we've done a great job, but we don't get credit for it.”","analysis":"Trump often makes misleading claims about the level of testing in the United States. It is accurate to say the United States has conducted more tests than any other country when looking only at raw numbers. The key indicator, however, is tests per capita, which gives a read on the share of the population that has contracted the disease and the speed with which it is spreading. The United States for months has been running behind peer nations in tests per capita.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28955, 29134, 27918, 27023, 26764, 25986, 23963, 23758, 23562, 22083, 23003, 22952, 22968, 21900, 22248, 22881, 21844, 22790, 21258, 21291, 22739, 21717, 22643, 21692, 20907, 20923, 21484, 21109, 21146, 21156, 20875, 20844, 20722, 20379, 20078, 19889, 20347, 18682, 19376, 18873, 19098, 19402, 19419, 19325, 18800, 19562, 19585, 18746, 18939, 19272, 18705, 18715, 18693, 18696, 19541, 19233, 19479, 19470, 19213, 19460, 19201, 18618, 19129, 19143, 19175, 19437, 19094, 19122, 18587, 18085, 17732, 18557, 18583, 18541, 18542, 18543, 18527, 17922, 17933, 17872, 16800","repeated_count":"81","date":"06/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
