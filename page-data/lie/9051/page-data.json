That does not even make it the biggest in Alaska. Its estimated oil reserves thus fall below Prudhoe Bay's 13.6 billion barrels, but are similar to the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska's (NPRA's) 10.6 billion barrels. The Ghawar field in Saudi Arabia, which has been producing oil since the 1950s, has 70 million barrels left in reserves.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"21316, 22658, 18662, 19137, 16375, 14050, 15100, 13285, 11559, 12050, 11872, 9972, 9100, 9051, 27092702","repeated_count":"16","date":"02/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
