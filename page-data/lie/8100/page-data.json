You want to see a Stock Market Crash, Impeach Trump!”","analysis":"The unemployment rate increased from 3.7 percent to 3.9 percent in December, so Trump can no longer say it's near a 50-year low, as 3.9 percent was achieved under the Clinton administration 18 years ago. However, on an annual basis, 3.9 percent in 2018 is the best since 3.5 percent was reached in 1969, 49 years ago. Trump can be pleased with the state of the economy and here he modified his frequent claim that it is \"the best economy\" ever. It can't top the late 1990s or the stellar growth in parts of the 1940s, 1960s and 1980s, according to key data. Wage growth is also disappointing compared with what it was in prior boom times, and the deficit has also surged, which experts warn could be a drag on the economy for years to come.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
