And they come in through our southern border into our country. And they'll have women taped — their mouths with duct tape, with electrical tape. They tape their face, their hair, their hands behind their back, their legs. They put them in the back seat of cars and vans, and they go — they don't come in through your port of entry because you’d see them. You couldn't do that.”","analysis":"Mentioning women trafficked with tape over their mouths has become a standard part of Trump’s talking points on the need for a border wall.

No prominent news reports have detailed a case that matches the president’s description. (The New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/us/border-mexico-women.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytpolitics\">reported</a> on March 1 it had found some instances of women being duct-taped and trafficked across the border, but “If the president was suggesting that such savagery occurs daily on America’s southern border, then he was indeed exaggerating.”)","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"24554, 24149, 21279, 13707, 10886, 8968, 8826, 8791, 8488, 8387, 7841, 7842, 7840, 7839, 8255, 7837, 7838, 7972","repeated_count":"18","date":"01/14/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
