They were accidentally wiped clean, 31 different phones. I think it was like 19 different people and they all did the same exact accident, which if you knew anything about phones, it's almost an impossibility to do it once, let alone 31 different times.”","analysis":"This is a tempest in a teapot. Justice Department records obtained by Judicial Watch reveal that some of the cell phones used by attorneys and investigators on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team had their cell phones a wiped during the Russia investigation. The erasures of data on the phones were the result of their investigators forgetting passwords, breaking or losing devises and other reasons mobile devices are often reset to factory settings. Trump and his allies tried to make a stink about the revelation but the DOJ Inspector General found that there was no improper conduct by Mueller's team.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25382, 25976, 25096, 24907, 24529, 24541, 24444, 23933, 24022","repeated_count":"9","date":"09/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
