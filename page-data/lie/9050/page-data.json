Richard Burr, Senator Burr said no collusion. Senate Intelligence, the House has come up, as you know, the committee, Devin Nunes and all, they said no collusion.”","analysis":"Sen. Richard Burr said the Senate Intelligence Committee has not found evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, but he went on to say that the investigation continues. Sen. Mark Warner, the vice chairman of the committee, has disputed Burr's statements and indicated there is plenty of evidence, such as all the documented contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians. It's important to keep in mind that the Senate Intelligence Committee is not investigating potential crimes related to Russia's interference in the 2016 election. Special counsel Robert Mueller's final report, released in April 2019, concluded the Trump campaign welcomed the assistance from Russia even if it did not coordinate with it:  “Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"10393, 10545, 9214, 9050, 8893, 8916, 8805, 8690, 8732, 8662, 8671, 8646, 8648, 8654, 6451, 6086, 5392, 5667","repeated_count":"18","date":"02/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
