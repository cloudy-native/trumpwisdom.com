Shokin was notorious in Ukraine and the international community of Western allies for turning a blind eye to corruption when he was Ukraine's prosecutor general. Shokin was not investigating Burisma Holdings, the natural gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat for five years, when Joe Biden was pushing for his ouster. In fact, the Western community wanted Shokin out partly because he was not pursuing the Burisma case.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
