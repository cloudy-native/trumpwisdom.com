It's called the death penalty. And I said to President Xi, \"You don't have much of a drug problem. Do you have a drug problem?\" \"No. No drug problem.\" I said, \"So you have 1.4 billion people, and you don't have a drug problem?\" \"That's right. No drug problem.\" I said, \"What do you attribute that to?\" \"Death penalty. Quick trial.”","analysis":"A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A-Peoples-War-final.pdf\">2016 Brookings Institution report</a> lays out that “people who smuggle, sell, transport, or manufacture heroin or methamphetamine in an amount greater than 50 grams can be sentenced to 15 years in prison, life imprisonment, or death” in China.\n\nDrug trafficking is one of the few criminal offenses that qualifies for the death penalty, but the idea that China does not have \"a big drug problem” because of the tough penalties is wrong. The number of drug addicts officially registered with the Chinese government rose to about 2.5 million in 2013 from just under a million in 2001. First-time offenders are generally sent to drug treatment centers, while repeat offenders are often sent to “education through labor” camps.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"8988, 8878, 8831, 2850","repeated_count":"4","date":"02/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
