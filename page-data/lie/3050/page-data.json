The president just left Washington -- Emmanuel, great guy -- nobody has guns in Paris, nobody. And we all remember more than 130 people, plus tremendous numbers of people that were horribly, horribly wounded -- you notice nobody ever talks about that?”","analysis":"French gun laws are certainly tough: There is no right to bear arms for the French, and to own a gun, you need a hunting or sporting license which needs to be repeatedly renewed and requires a psychological evaluation. But japan has even tougher laws. Almost no residents in Japan own guns. The few civilians who manage to own guns are required to tell authorities how the weapon will be used and how ammunition is stored.","pinocchios":"","category":"Guns","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/04/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
