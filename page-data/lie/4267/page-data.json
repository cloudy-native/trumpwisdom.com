California does divert water from its rivers, as Trump suggests — but not into the Pacific. As the state's population has grown, its residents have redirected water to cities for drinking and to farmlands for irrigating. The water that remains in California's rivers still does what it had always done — flow from their headwaters at higher elevations down into the ocean. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said it has more than enough water to fight the blazes.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"26991, 27314, 25360, 25166, 26006, 24729, 24183, 24261, 24124, 24138, 24144, 24146, 24035, 23987, 20985, 17451, 14783, 14154, 14263, 12161, 11078, 10474, 8033, 7302, 7233, 7484, 6114, 4266, 4267","repeated_count":"29","date":"08/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
