And he's a never-Trumper. And I think somebody said he worked for Biden at one point.”","analysis":"Steve Scully is political editor of C-SPAN and a 30-year veteran of the network, without any hint of bias one way or the other. Scully was to moderate the second debate between Trump and Joe Biden, which was canceled after Trump would not agree to a virtual format because of his Covid-19 diagnosis. Without evidence, Trump called Scully a \"never Trumper.\" Scully tweeted “@Scaramucci should I respond to Trump.” Anthony Scaramucci, a former Trump communications director and now a critic of the president, advised Scully to ignore him. But the tweet was noticed and Scully was suspended by C-SPAN after he falsely claimed his Twitter account had been hacked. But the fact remains that Trump had no basis to call Scully a never-Trumper. As a college student, Scully had an internship in Biden's Senate office, which Trump sometimes claimed meant that he \"worked\" for Biden.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"26740, 26696, 27423, 25745, 25486, 25342, 25615, 25151, 25173","repeated_count":"9","date":"10/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
