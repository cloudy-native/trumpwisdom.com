If you look at the young sailor — Saucier — I mean he went to jail over not classified, a much lower level.  And it’s very unfair that he goes to jail, and that Comey’s allowed to do it all over.  It’s very unfair.”","analysis":"Former FBI Director James Comey said that the president's tweet about possible \"tapes\" of their conversations led him to believe their might be corroboration for the memos that he had written while still FBI director. Comey took contemporaneous notes following each of his meetings with the president and president-elect, which he shared with the senior leadership of the FBI. Comey intentionally wrote these in a way that the information wouldn't be classified.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"19718, 12637, 11580, 10540, 10178, 7458, 3921, 3397, 3309, 3320, 2929, 2627, 2789, 0826, 0768, 0724, 0652","repeated_count":"17","date":"06/08/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
