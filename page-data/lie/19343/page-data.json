Plus, the Department of Justice approached the White House about Flynn's lies as soon as they knew he was lying to the Vice President (and later investigators). Trump keeps saying that because FBI agents did not think Flynn indicated he was lying when they asked him about his contacts with a Russian official, that meant he was not lying. But it was only a matter of perception. They did not think he showed signs of being a liar. But he did lie, as shown by monitoring of his conversations with the official and his own admission in court that he lied. Flynn repeatedly affirmed that he lied to the FBI during his first sentencing hearing Dec. 18, 2018. Trump himself <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937007006526959618\">tweeted</a> that he fired Flynn \"because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI.\" (Flynn also admitted in the statement of offense to lying in March 2017 in his official lobbying disclosure forms about acting as an agent of the government of Turkey.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25617, 25179, 25140, 24522, 20872, 20896, 20730, 19343, 19717, 18742, 9566, 9445, 8471, 4815, 3816, 3933, 2902","repeated_count":"17","date":"05/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
