When adjusted for agencies that didn't report data, the math works out. However, this metric counts a shove and a stabbing — two very different acts — as equal. According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/15/donald-trump/police-officer-assaulted-every-10-minutes/\">an analysis by PolitiFact</a>, only 28.9 percent of these assaults resulted in injuries and a firearm or knife was used in just over five percent. Trump is skating a fine line. His math checks out, but the context how he is presenting \"assault\" is misleading.
