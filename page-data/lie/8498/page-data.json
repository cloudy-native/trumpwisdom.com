Without new resources from Congress, we will be forced to release these people into communities -- something we don't want to do -- called catch-and-release. You catch them. Even if they are criminals, you then release them.”","analysis":"Catch and release is a collection of policies, court precedents, executive actions and federal statutes spanning more than 20 years, cobbled together throughout Democratic and Republican administrations, including his own. It primarily applies to asylum seekers and children. People with serious crimes on their records, whether in the U.S. or another country, are not eligible for asylum. More than two-thirds of these individuals show up for their immigration hearings and so are not indefinitely released.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26946, 26835, 26671, 27144, 26210, 26327, 25697, 25568, 25438, 25356, 24434, 24097, 23680, 21591, 22455, 18863, 17785, 16549, 16205, 16476, 16347, 14676, 12687, 11639, 11954, 11939, 11899, 11850, 11141, 11719, 10877, 10263, 10006, 9890, 9645, 9705, 9536, 9297, 9140, 9141, 8852, 8451, 8498, 8324, 8280, 8167, 8195, 8216, 8217, 8223, 7891, 7893, 7910, 7911, 7912, 7148, 7077, 7078, 7079, 7081, 6537, 6557, 6644, 6202, 6386, 6161, 6425, 6486, 5899, 5818, 4401, 4288, 4525, 3892, 3460, 3847, 3945, 3955, 3917, 3936, 3318, 3270, 3202, 3172, 3122, 3083, 2816, 2829, 2695","repeated_count":"89","date":"01/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
