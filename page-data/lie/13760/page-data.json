In fact, I see, we're at forty-nine today in Rasmussen… we're at fifty-one in another one.”","analysis":"Trump cited a poll for Oct. 10 that found he had a 49 percent approval rating by Rasmussen, which consistently has a Republican-leaning bias. The polling gurus at FiveThirtyEight say that an adjusted rating would have shown Trump at 43 percent in the poll. Overall, Trump had an average approval of 41.9 percent in 538's blended poll rating, along with 53.8 percent disapproval.
