And we sacrificed so many -- 60,000 plants. Millions and millions of jobs were lost during, I call them, 'the stupid years.' But now we're back into the really smart years.”","analysis":"Trump is likely referring to the number of U.S. factory closures and job losses since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, a talking point he often uses. These remarks were made during a discussion of new China tariffs. The number for factory closures is accurate, but to suggest China was the only factor is misleading. Economists say automation and other forces also played a role. The number for job losses is seriously exaggerated. Official government data show 4.3 million to 4.7 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost after China joined the WTO -- but, again, although China had a big role, it's misleading to blame it all on them.\n\n","pinocchios":"2","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
