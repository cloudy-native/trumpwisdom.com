This is a brand new demand. Crazy!”","analysis":"This tweet concerns a dispute over the number of beds available to detain undocumented immigrants rounded up in the interior. In discussions over the spending bill, Democrats sought a cap of 16,500. Republicans claimed this would result in the failure to detain violent offenders, but Democrats argued it would force Immigration and Customs Enforcement to choose among who is picked up from the interior, meaning they’d focus more on violent offenders, resulting in fewer detentions of nonviolent longtime residents. Trump called it a \"brand new demand,\" which depends on your perspective. Democrats had signaled they would seek such a cap, but did not press hard for it until the end of the negotiations. In the end, Democrats gave ground on this issue.
