I think NATO is wonderful. But you know what? We're paying for 80 percent of NATO -- could be higher. They say 72 percent. So, we're paying for 80 percent of NATO.”","analysis":"Direct spending for NATO is governed by a formula based on each nation's gross national income — the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country. With the largest economy in NATO, the United States pays the largest share — about 22 percent. Germany is second, with about 15 percent. Trump gets his 72 percent figure by counting the U.S. share of all defense expenditures, even though many of those U.S. expenses have nothing to do with NATO or European defense. Long before Trump became president, NATO had set a guideline of each member spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense -- by 2024.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/08/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
