For the first time maybe ever, the trade deficit just fell — think of that — for the quarter, $52 billion. Nobody reports it. Why don’t you report that? Just fell by $52 billion.”","analysis":"The $52 billion figure is based on a misinterpretation of the Commerce Department data; in reality the drop in the trade deficit between the first and second quarters is about $20 billion. For the first half of the year, the trade deficit increased and is on track to be the biggest since 2008. Many experts think that the data was affected by the fact that companies overseas rushed to buy U.S. goods before Trump’s tariffs took effect.
