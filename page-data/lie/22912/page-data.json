About 1 percent of abortions happen after the point of viability, so the cases at issue in this debate would be relatively rare. Trump also grossly exaggerates. Supporting abortion rights is not the same as supporting abortions. The Democrats in the presidential race appeared to be somewhat divided on abortion regulations, with some saying they favored no restrictions and others saying they favored limits based on settled law and Supreme Court rulings. They were not all marching in lockstep, as Trump often claims.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"27181, 27448, 25592, 25089, 24039, 24094, 24004, 22090, 22912, 20046, 18624, 18422, 17851, 18317, 16855, 18188, 16554, 16213, 16353, 18630, 14957, 14725, 15377, 15611, 15002, 15527, 14680, 18629, 15112, 13887, 13726, 18628, 12113, 18626, 18627, 18625, 18631","repeated_count":"37","date":"08/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
