It's supposed to be the other way around.”","analysis":"Trump's claim that the U.S. had an $800 billion trade deficit is wrong. The U.S. had a $566 billion trade deficit in 2017, when goods and services are counted. But Trump only counts trade in goods. In any case, countries do not make or lose money on trade deficits. The trade deficit widened even more in 2018, to $628 billion, contrary to Trump's claims that he has reduced it.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"15701, 11707, 10631, 10559, 10384, 9873, 9675, 9311, 9106, 8999, 8890, 8368, 7320, 7305, 7394, 6583, 6220, 6019, 6117, 5444, 5254, 5726, 4510, 4607, 4674, 3718, 3657, 3674, 3576, 4027, 3400, 3363, 3661, 3325, 3215, 2588, 2543, 2478, 2493, 2500, 2485, 2469, 2468, 1736, 1646, 1591, 0359, 0264, 0237","repeated_count":"49","date":"11/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
