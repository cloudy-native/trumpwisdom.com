Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions. He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!”","analysis":"Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) summarized the content of Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at a congressional hearing, occasionally for dramatic effect (or what Schiff called a parody.) There is no exact transcript of the conversation, as the summary was cobbled together from notes, so Schiff told the audience that \"this is the essence of what the president communicates.\" Much of what Schiff tracks the basic contents of the call but he went too far to claim Trump had asked Zelensky to “make up” or “manufacture” dirt; Trump simply asked for an investigation of a potential 2020 rival. Trump sometimes claims that Schiff was guilty of a \"crime\" and should be tried for \"treason\" but there is no basis to make such claims. Schiff engaged in political speech. “Treason,” defined by the Constitution, is giving “aid and comfort” to “enemies” of the United States, or “levying war” against the United States.
