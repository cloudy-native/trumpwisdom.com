If it's not Trump related, they don't cover it. It's got to be Trump or Trump related, so the plane goes down and it's total devastation. If a ship goes down, if the Titanic, if the Titanic equivalent went down, they wouldn't cover it. Unless I was on the sucker. They wouldn't cover it.”","analysis":"There aren't any jets that carry 700 people, for one thing. But with typical hyperbole Trump appears to be saying that the news media covers nothing unless it concerns him. Trust us, any plane crash, even with only dozens of people aboard, is closely covered by the news media.
