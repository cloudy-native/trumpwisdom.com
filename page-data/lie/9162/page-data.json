But I think we had a very good meeting. In fact, when I came home they put out a statement. That actually they were willing to do much less on the sanction front, but you see that's not what happened there.”","analysis":"The North Korean foreign minister denied that Pyongyang requested the lifting of all sanctions, as Trump had claimed in his news conference before departing Hanoi.

What Pyongyang was seeking, he said, was the lifting of sanctions that impede the civilian economy -- not the lifting of sanctions on armaments.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
