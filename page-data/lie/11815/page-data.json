They admitted their guilt. If you look at Linda Fairstein, and if you look at some of prosecutors, they think that the city should never have settled that case. So we'll leave it at that.”","analysis":"Overwhelming evidence shows that the Central Park Five, a group of African Americans, were wrongly accused and convicted of the rape of a female jogger in New York in 1989. The perpetrator, Matias Reyes, later confessed to the crime. DNA evidence matched Reyes to the scene. The New York district attorney's office in 2002 recommended that all charges and convictions against the five African American men be vacated, and a court agreed. But Trump, who waged a public campaign against the five African American men decades ago, says their innocence is unclear because the prosecutor who led the case has defended her actions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
