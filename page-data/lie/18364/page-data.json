The whole world laughs at us with our court systems. Everybody comes across, they touch our land, you have to go to court. … Other places they say, ‘You're on our land. I'm sorry, you can't come in. You can't come in.’ Us, we take them to court. We have judges all over the place.”","analysis":"False. The U.S. system is remarkably similar to those in many European nations, and experts said the same process is followed by countries in other parts of the world. Like the United States, Belgium, Britain, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden and Switzerland all have executive branch officers who are set up to be free from political influence evaluating requests for refugee status or asylum in the first instance, according to a database maintained by the European Program for Integration and Migration. As in the United States, those determinations can be appealed. The same is true for many countries in other continents, said Alison Parker, managing director of the U.S. program at Human Rights Watch.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
