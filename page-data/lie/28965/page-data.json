You don't hear these numbers from the fake news. Think of that, 97%.”","analysis":"Trump appears to be referring to a weekly report that notes the percentage of ER visits due to potential cover-19 cases. A FactCheck.org <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/10/trump-spins-er-statistic-to-claim-u-s-is-in-great-shape-on-covid-19/\">analysis</a> reports the number did hover around two to three percent (meaning 97 percent of patients had other complaints) at the end of October, but that is up from two percent in September and continued climbing. Still the low number gives a false sense of promise, as the highest the percentage has ever been was around seven percent in the harrowing days of early April. (By the end of November, the rate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/11302020/outpatient-emergency-visits.html\">was at</a> a similar height.) CDC has explained the metric “currently being affected by changes in health care seeking behavior, including increased use of telemedicine and increased social distancing.” In other words, Trump’s suggestion that it is a good omen of some sort or a meaningful indicator of how the country is managing the pandemic is misleading.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28953, 29146, 28398, 28965","repeated_count":"4","date":"10/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
