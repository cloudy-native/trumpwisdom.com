Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment. The Dems and their committees are going 'nuts.' The Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt!”","analysis":"Under the U.S. Constitution, Congress has an important oversight role. Trump is complaining about routine investigations often undertaken by Congress, especially when the opposition party has control. Republicans conducted numerous investigations of the Obama administration, including repeated investigations of the Benghazi tragedy. The House even created a select committee to probe the administration's response. Trump also made investigations of his financial affairs more likely when he refused to release his tax returns, contrary to every president since 1975, or to place his investment and business affairs in a blind trust, like other presidents. As for \"stealing people\" who work at the White House, there is no evidence that people who have decided to work for Schiff came directly from the White House.
