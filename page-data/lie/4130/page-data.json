It’s 30 miles off the border. And that’s a tough border. Thousands of cannons, they call them. These are big, big guns. I’m not even talking about nuclear.

You could have had a war like you haven’t had in a long time.”","analysis":"North Korea does have thousands of rocket launchers and artillery positioned toward South Korea. According to the Congressional Research Service, these weapons are believed to be able to fire 10,000 rounds per minute at Seoul and kill between 30,000 and 300,000 South Koreans “in the first days of fighting.” The CRS report adds that “an escalation of a military conflict on the peninsula could affect upwards of 25 million people on either side of the border.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
