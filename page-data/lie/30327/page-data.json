It's -- it's been incredible. The crowds have been incredible. And, you know, nobody's ever had it before....It hasn't taken place ever in history, in the history of our country what we have done in terms of crowd size....If Ronald Reagan came in to do a rally, because he was a popular guy, if he had 200 or 300 people, that's fine, that's like, you know, anticipated. Usually they'd go to a ballroom and they'd have it in a ballroom.”","analysis":"Trump often has empty seats at rallies and routinely exaggerates how many people attended. He can't claim to have the biggest political crowds in U.S. history. Ronald Reagan spoke to huge crowds. For instance, in 1984, a Reagan rally <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1984-09-10-2428373-story.html\">attracted 100,000 people</a> to a rally in Doylestown, about two hours away from Hersey, Pa., where Trump in 2019 spoke to a crowd estimated to be about 10,000 people. Trump sometimes suggests he has the biggest rallies in world history, but the Nazi Nuremberg rallies led by Adolf Hitler attracted hundreds of thousands of people, far more than any Trump rally. (Like Trump, the Nazis lied about crowd estimates so we can discount claims of 1 million people. But the fairgrounds likely could hold 250,000 to 350,000.) Barack Obama <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/barack-obama-returns-berlin-scene-iconic-2008-speech-n684066\">attracted a crowd of about 200,000 people</a> in 2008 when he gave a speech in Berlin.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"30996, 30327, 30359, 30368, 29790, 30045, 29415, 28890, 27745, 27783, 27264","repeated_count":"11","date":"11/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
