Clapper told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was not aware of evidence showing collusion between members of the Trump campaign and the Russians. Clapper also said he was not aware of the FBI's investigation into the collusion until then-FBI Director James Comey revealed it on March 20, 2017. The FBI director has discretion to keep such counterintelligence investigations closely held, and only notify the DNI when appropriate, Clapper said.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"0576, 0573","repeated_count":"2","date":"05/08/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
