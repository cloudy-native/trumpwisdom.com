Zogby found that Trump was “doing very well” with suburban women, with his approval sitting at 50 percent. A “significant plurality” of 45 percent backed Trump trying to find funding for a border fence, and 50 percent of the group backed Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to get a barrier built on the border. But, while about 50 percent of suburban women agree with the declaration, according to Zogby, slightly more disagree, thanks to the wonders of rounding. About 4 in 10 strongly disagree with the emergency, while 3 in 10 strongly agree. Importantly, Zogby’s results come from a survey conducted online using a methodology that has been shown to yield results of widely varying quality. What’s more, asking whether respondents agree or disagree can influence more “agree” responses; it’s why The Washington Post and other pollsters instead ask whether people “support or oppose” a policy proposal. Suburban women in a recent NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist poll were asked whether they approved or disapproved of Trump’s national emergency declaration. Overall, 36 percent of adults said they approved — while 31 percent of suburban women agreed. Zogby pegs much of its assessment that Trump’s support from suburban women has grown to this idea that they back his moves on border security, but other polling suggests that they broadly oppose those moves.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/24/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
