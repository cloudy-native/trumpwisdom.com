He was never Senate-confirmed the first time. I don't think he's supposed to even be calling himself an ambassador because he couldn't get Senate-confirmed. He got in through a little trick, and he was there for a fairly short period of time. I put him here because he couldn't get Senate-confirmed. This was a non-Senate-confirmed position, as you know. He stayed for a short while, and I felt that it was not appropriate that he stay any longer. I wasn't impressed.”","analysis":"Bolton, who was Trump's national security adviser for 17 months, was confirmed by the Senate for a number of administration posts. His nomination to be UN ambassador had majority support in the Senate but was subjected to a Democratic filibuster, requiring 60 votes to proceed to a final vote. He became UN ambassador through a recess appointment. The rules have since changed so administration positions are no longer subject to the 60-vote hurdle -- which is a key reason why Trump has managed to name so many right-wing figures. Bolton would not have had trouble winning Senate approval under the current rules.
