Nobody can be this stupid. Just allow us to find the crime, and turn the state Republican..The consent decree signed by the 'Secretar'\", with the consent of Kemp, is perhaps even more poorly negotiated than the deal that John Kerry made with Iran.”","analysis":"Trump greatly exaggerates the impact of legal settlement signed in March, after a lawsuit by the Democratic Party, that set statewide standards for judging signatures on absentee ballot envelopes. The Democrats had argued that minorities ended up having a larger proportion of their ballots rejected, so the settlement laid out steps to notify voters if there was a potential problem with a signature match. Under the settlement, voters must be contacted the next business day — by phone or email — if their absentee ballot is rejected because of a signature issue. “The State of Georgia entered a consent decree that essentially did one thing and one thing only … instead of giving three days to inform a voter there was an issue with their ballot, [it] is down to 24 hours when you're within 11 days of the election,” said Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/georgia-press-conference-on-election-count-updates-transcript-november-17\">at a Nov. 17 news conference</a>. “That is the one and only thing that that consent order addressed in any real way.” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GASecretaryofState/posts/3561858110596406\">a Facebook post</a> in November, noted that the rejection rate from 2018 to 2020 was the “exact same. … So, the idea that some settlement agreement that we entered into changed how counties were doing this is basically nonsense.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31346, 31159, 31212, 31269, 31258, 31070, 30669, 30626","repeated_count":"8","date":"12/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
