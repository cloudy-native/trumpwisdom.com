It's very important. It's really a border security vote. It's -- pure and simple, it's a vote for border security, it's a vote for no crime.”","analysis":"It's a real legal question whether Trump can circumvent Congress's power under the Constitution to approve or reject spending by declaring a national emergency to fund his promised border wall. Many legal scholars say he can't, including conservatives. Trump says 80 percent of people support his border wall proposal. But the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2019/03/spinning-popular-support-for-emergency-declaration/?platform=hootsuite\">poll</a> he is referring to actually asked whether respondents favored \"basically open borders\" or \"secure borders.\" Seventy-nine percent of respondents said they favored secure borders. Many Democrats hold the same position. But a continuous wall along the border is a much different and more specific proposition that does not enjoy wide support, according to multiple surveys. Trump routinely argues that immigrants bring more crime, but researchers have found continually that legal and unauthorized immigrants commit crime at lower rates than the native-born population.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/14/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
