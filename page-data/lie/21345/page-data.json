Biden's against all of those things. He's against oil, he's against the bible, essentially, against religion, but against the bible, and he's against the Second Amendment.”","analysis":"Trump often says Biden is against God. This is a ridiculous comment. Joe Biden is devout Catholic who attends mass regularly, in contrast to Trump -- who rarely goes to church and appears to know little about the Bible. Democrats are not \"against the Bible\" either. Trump also frequently, but without evidence, says Biden would \"terminate religious liberty,\" even though that right is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"30929, 29768, 30240, 30441, 29225, 29325, 29402, 29646, 29498, 30107, 28521, 28855, 28263, 27815, 27657, 27774, 26624, 27069, 27413, 27110, 26429, 25542, 25945, 24630, 24452, 24133, 22067, 22363, 20943, 21703, 21345, 21360, 21785, 22001, 21213","repeated_count":"35","date":"08/06/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
