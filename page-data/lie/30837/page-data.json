This is a national disgrace. No other advanced country conducts elections this way. Many European countries have instituted major restrictions on mail-in voting specifically because they recognize the nearly unlimited potential for fraud. Out of 42 European nations, all but two prohibit absentee ballots entirely for people who reside inside the country, or else they require those who need absentee ballots to show a very, very powerful ID.”","analysis":"Most countries in Europe do not allow absentee voting, but Trump is wrong to say there are only two. We identified at least seven countries in which all voters are eligible for in-country postal voting, including some of the largest countries, such as Britain, Germany, Spain and Poland,. Trump's remarks had a bit of caveat — it sounded like he said only two countries in Europe allowed mail-in ballots for people who reside in the country, but then he added that others also require “a very, very powerful ID.” But that’s a red herring, given that many of these countries have national ID cards. It also ignores the fact that countries have other ways to accommodate voters who cannot go to the polls, such as proxy voting.
