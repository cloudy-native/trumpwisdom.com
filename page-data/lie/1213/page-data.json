This is a massive economic disadvantage for America costing us millions and millions of jobs and trillions of dollars.”","analysis":"The United States certainly has one of the highest statutory corporate tax rates in the world, currently pegged as high as 39.1 percent when including state taxes. Trump is comparing that to the average rate for the other members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which is 25.5 percent when not weighted for GDP. But the official rate does not necessarily tell the whole story. What also matters is the actual tax a company pays, after deductions and tax benefits -- the effective tax rate. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41743.pdf\">According to the Congressional Research Service</a>, the effective rate for the United States is 27.1 percent, compared to an effective GDP-weighted average of 27.7 percent for the OECD.
