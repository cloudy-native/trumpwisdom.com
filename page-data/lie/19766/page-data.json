Remember when they got me, when I said wiretapping, meaning ‘wiretapping’ in quotes or spying, but it was in quotes because I'm talking about the modern day version. I said, ‘They're wiretapping. They're spying on me.’ Remember how you thought that was such a terrible tweet, right? I was right. They're spying on me. They spied on me. And that's not being paranoid. That's being fact. It's now known that they spied on me. They spied on Flynn.”","analysis":"This is ridiculous. First, Trump floods his Twitter feed with false and misleading claims; it's way more than \"once every 500 tweets.\" He has flat-out claimed -- repeatedly, and despite all evidence -- that Obama ordered a wiretap on Trump to spy on him during the 2016 campaign. Contrary to what he claims here, the spying allegation has never been proven.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
