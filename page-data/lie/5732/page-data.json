They were laughing with me. We had fun. That was not laughing at me. So the fake news said, people laughed at President Trump. They didn't laugh at me. People had a good time with me. We were doing it together.”","analysis":"A classic \"they were laughing with me, not at me\" defense. Trump opened a speech to the UN General Assembly by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-z4y8OJxlK8\">claiming</a>, \"My administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.\" The video clearly shows that the UN delegates broke into laughter at this bold, Trumpian claim. Trump then gamely said, \"Didn't expect that reaction, but that's okay.\" This led to some more laughter. But it seems pretty clear that this little moment started with foreign dignitaries laughing at, not with, Trump.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
