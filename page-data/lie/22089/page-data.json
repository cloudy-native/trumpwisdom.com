Trump has not offered a replacement plan, despite promising one since days before taking office in 2017.\n\nWe have also given Four Pinocchios to several Republican senators who have consistently worked to undermine the Affordable Care Act and its coverage guarantee, and who support the GOP lawsuit pending before the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Republican Party has spent 10 years trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its coverage guarantee for patients with preexisting conditions, but GOP lawmakers have never come to an agreement on how to replace the law.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"31248, 30976, 29847, 30042, 30311, 30320, 30540, 29254, 29314, 29389, 29456, 29643, 29554, 29723, 29972, 29999, 29052, 29158, 28469, 28587, 28488, 28809, 29003, 28347, 27970, 27693, 27854, 27914, 27741, 26951, 27035, 26851, 26684, 27153, 27486, 27203, 27345, 27530, 26399, 26477, 26503, 26226, 26276, 26286, 26309, 26311, 26131, 26162, 25709, 25582, 25476, 25491, 25362, 25588, 25274, 26591, 26020, 25962, 25930, 25130, 25008, 25064, 25138, 24869, 24657, 24573, 24461, 24234, 24111, 24021, 23882, 23706, 23517, 23299, 23168, 23086, 22089, 22073, 21951, 21931, 22887, 21846, 22626, 21633, 20459, 20421, 20064, 19995, 19888, 19334, 18792, 17715, 18017, 17823, 17599, 17786, 17044, 18417, 17535, 17350, 17413, 16900, 18310, 16850, 16553, 15954, 16055, 16212, 16050, 15886, 16352, 14955, 15719, 14724, 15609, 14980, 15526, 14678, 15108, 13779, 13885, 13454, 13724, 12754, 12696, 12438, 11606, 12110, 11966, 11909, 11738, 10581, 10615, 10770, 10528, 10890, 10269, 9795, 9526, 7355, 7386, 6734, 6883, 6962, 7115, 7152, 6806, 6900, 6596, 6756, 7046, 6550, 6639, 6658, 6241, 5608, 5976, 6002, 6343, 6382, 6158, 6480, 5490, 6112, 5895, 5568, 5597, 5615, 5352, 5306, 5519, 5812, 5848, 5216, 5755, 5113, 5696","repeated_count":"177","date":"08/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
