If the government shuts down, all active duty military personnel would keep working and all operations in war zones would continue, according to a 2015 contingency plan the Defense Department prepared. Trump and the Defense Department have very broad powers to exempt government workers from the shutdown, and the Defense Department’s practice during previous shutdowns has been to retain personnel as needed to address national security and emergencies, and to “continue many other operations necessary for the safety of human life or the protection of property.”","pinocchios":"3","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"2172, 2100, 2143, 2120, 2068","repeated_count":"5","date":"01/16/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
