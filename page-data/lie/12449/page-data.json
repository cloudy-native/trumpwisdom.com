[Retweeting a post that said, 'Fire marshal says Donald Trump DID smash Elton John's attendance record at New Hampshire arena']”","analysis":"Trump says he broke Sir Elton John's crowd-size record at the Southern New Hampshire University Arena. The difference was an estimated 200 people, which is not especially meaningful because figuring out crowd sizes of this magnitude is more art than science. The fire marshall said Trump drew 11,500 people in mid-August, compared with 11,300 for a John concert in 2004. Those who don't obsess about crowd sizes might say that both John and Trump filled the venue to capacity and leave it at that. What's more, Trump gave away tickets to his rally for free; Elton John tickets aren't cheap.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"30333, 30165, 30318, 29414, 28355, 28722, 29019, 27930, 27696, 27032, 26742, 26792, 26724, 27263, 26902, 27177, 25959, 25981, 25783, 25085, 23634, 21885, 21762, 19473, 18482, 18066, 18116, 18388, 17422, 17471, 18337, 17282, 17356, 16500, 16455, 16270, 16277, 16321, 14959, 14323, 14653, 15059, 15092, 13783, 13238, 12469, 12449, 12381, 11602, 11671, 12091, 12108, 12020, 12021, 11930, 11873, 11874, 11165, 11768, 11157, 10588, 10628, 10696, 10544, 10854, 10225, 9499, 9091, 9093, 9094, 9153, 8286, 8170, 7012, 7013, 7434, 7460, 6704, 6705, 6708, 6868, 6944, 7095, 6662, 6524, 6758, 6217, 6247, 6328, 6336, 6346, 6408, 6169, 5488, 5871, 5889, 5446, 5559, 6064, 5076, 5560, 5575, 5502, 5507, 5189, 5235, 5236, 5237, 5179, 5180","repeated_count":"110","date":"08/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
