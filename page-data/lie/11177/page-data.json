It used to be Saudi Arabia, then Russia. It’s now -- we're number one and soon -- as soon as I get the pipelines in Texas approved which I’ll do pretty quickly, it would have taken 10, 15 years. I'm going to have it done quickly. We could increase our production by 30 and 40 percent in terms of sale.”","analysis":"The United States has long been an energy exporter. The U.S. has been the leading energy producer in the world since at least 2014. Trump pledged during his campaign to turn the country into a net energy exporter, meaning it sells more energy to other countries than it buys from them. But that hasn't happened and the U.S. Energy Information Administration <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=38152\">estimates</a> it won't happen until sometime between 2020 and 2030. The U.S. became a net exporter of natural gas for the first time <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=35392\">in 2017</a>, and exports of crude oil and petroleum products more than doubled from 2010 to 2016. For one week in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37772\">November 2018</a>, the U.S. was even a net exporter of crude oil. It’s important to note that the United States lifted restrictions on exporting crude oil in December 2015, while Obama was in office. Regardless, the U.S. is not energy independent.
