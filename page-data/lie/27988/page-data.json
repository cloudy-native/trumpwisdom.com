By the way, you know all the money he raised? I could raise much more. I could sit for one day in the White House and call up every guy on Wall Street, the heads of every firm, I need 10 million, I need 25 million right now, give it to the campaign. I'd have money, I would set every record in the book. I don't want to do that, because when you do that, when you do that -- number one, we don't need it. ...But I would have those donors, I would be -- they would be talking Trump raised 900 million dollars. I could do that so easy but I don't want to do that. If I do that -- you'll see there's something wrong. I'm the president of the United States, I know many of these people. Every time he raises big money like that, they've made deals. They've made deals, they're very simple. I serve the people.”","analysis":"Without evidence, Trump suggests Biden is guilty of corruption because he is raising so much more money than the president.

Nearly 1.9 million women donated to Biden’s campaign — compared to roughly 505,000 for Trump — accounting for 47 percent of his total fundraising.\" Sometimes, Trump spins a tale about he could easily raise millions of dollars with a single phone call to a corporate executive -- transactions that would violate campaign finance limits.
