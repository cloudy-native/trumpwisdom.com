Japan is now paying us $40 billion. They weren't paying us. They weren't doing anything....Japan, we did a deal for $40 billion, $40 billion a year.”","analysis":"This is grossly misleading. Trump signed a deal with Japan that returns benefits American farmers lost when he pulled out of a broader Asia-Pacific pact his first week in office, as Japan went ahead with the agreement with 11 other nations, putting U.S. farmers at a disadvantage. The deal did not resolve differences over trade in autos, but tariffs will be cut on $7 billion worth of agricultural products and markets will be opened on about $40 billion worth of digital trade between the two countries. But Trump describes it as $40 billion coming in the bank.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"22061, 19938, 18860, 19407, 19634, 18777, 19508, 18037, 17615, 17389, 18153, 18435, 17454, 17750, 16939, 18206, 16738, 16755, 16782, 18181, 16709, 16491, 16683, 16101, 16142, 16369, 16251","repeated_count":"27","date":"05/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
