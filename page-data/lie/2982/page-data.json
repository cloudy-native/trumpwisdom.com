At the dinner for Ivanka Trump before when she arrived in Seoul, Moon said that President Trump's active support and attention had been a \"very important factor\" in the success of the Olympic games. Moon called on the U.S. to tamp down its harsh rhetoric toward the North in advance of the games, fearing a preemptive strike by the U.S. or an attack from the North. The U.S. certainly had the opportunity to de-escalate the pending crisis but did not move to do so. Instead it was the South who invited the North to send athletes to the games, which helped assure there would be no disruptions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"18048, 16694, 3563, 3365, 2982, 2954, 2766, 2914, 2776, 2490","repeated_count":"10","date":"04/28/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
