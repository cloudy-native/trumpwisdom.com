Well, that’s not right.  They transship all through other countries.  And you’ll see that a country that doesn’t even have a steel mill is sending us 3 percent steel for our country.  And many countries are doing it, but it comes from China.... And it’s putting our steel mills out of business.  Our aluminum mills are going out of business.  And we need steel and we need aluminum.”","analysis":"Experts have said that transshipment is hard to calculate and track. However, it's clear that Trump is muddling his numbers here. According to the Department of Commerce, not Chinese reporters as Trump suggests, 2 percent of U.S. steel (or about 3.5 percent by value)  come from China. As we've previously pointed out, only 3 percent of total aluminum industry jobs are the smelting jobs in the United States, according to the Aluminum Association. The rest of the jobs are in aluminum production and processing, which has been relatively consistent since 1980. Meanwhile, U.S. steel exports as a share of the domestic market are only 27.5 percent, about the level in 1997. Monthly crude steel production has been consistent since the Great Recession. Fewer workers are required because the factories are run more efficiently.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29780, 29347, 29493, 29749, 29123, 28074, 28325, 26632, 24774, 23474, 20989, 19323, 17936, 17109, 17286, 18151, 16197, 15437, 15830, 14939, 14020, 13773, 12291, 11631, 12041, 12199, 11458, 11800, 11026, 10579, 10941, 10314, 10288, 9977, 9990, 9755, 9666, 9392, 8872, 8847, 8572, 8508, 8068, 7969, 7977, 7397, 7421, 7017, 7441, 6789, 6938, 6973, 6792, 6771, 7061, 6576, 6279, 6284, 6122, 5400, 5586, 5613, 5263, 5784, 5652, 4791, 4589, 4703, 4604, 4711, 4414, 4278, 4570, 4533, 4560, 3764, 3447, 3448, 2791, 2496, 2499, 2467","repeated_count":"82","date":"03/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
