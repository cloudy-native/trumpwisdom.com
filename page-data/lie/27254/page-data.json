I'm the President of the United States. I'm like a really smart guy like you are, but I tell you what, well, think of this, think of this, if I wanted to pick up a phone and call Wall Street say the big firms, say, yeah, got to raise extra, they'll do it everywhere. I mean it's so easy, it's so easy. I could have more money. The problem is if you do that, what happens is when they call you in two months, three months, four months because they need something, you got to take their call and you gotta do it. So Biden is raising a lot of money because they're promising all these things to all these people”","analysis":"Without evidence, Trump suggests Biden is guilty of corruption because he is raising so much more money than the president.

Nearly 1.9 million women donated to Biden’s campaign — compared to roughly 505,000 for Trump — accounting for 47 percent of his total fundraising.\" Sometimes, Trump spins a tale about he could easily raise millions of dollars with a single phone call to a corporate executive -- transactions that would violate campaign finance limits.
