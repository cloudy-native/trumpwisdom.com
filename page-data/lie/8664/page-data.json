The methodology was not published. Clifton claims in his post that \"Gallup asked the whole population of Latin America\" how many would move to a different country. But it's impossible for a polling organization to question the entire population of Latin America. Clifton later mentions that Gallup \"analytics\" show 42 million people in Latin America \"want to come to the U.S.,\" but those analytics aren't available in his post. Clifton later calls them \"forty-two million seekers of citizenship or asylum,\" but this seems incorrect because wanting to move somewhere doesn't make someone a seeker of citizenship or asylum. They could be hoping for green cards or to immigrate illegally. Clifton and Trump mention \"open borders,\" which no one is pushing for and which is not an accurate way to describe the heavily guarded southern border.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
