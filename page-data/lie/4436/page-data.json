Even I said how did that happen? That's like a great -- how good is that? But our farmers -- if you look at soybean prices, go five years before our great election in '16, go five years before, go five years back, soy beans went down by 50 percent on election night. They were down by 50 percent from what they were five years before.”","analysis":"The price of soybeans has not dropped “50 percent since 5 years before the election,” according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. In 2011, five years before the 2016 election, soybeans peaked at $13.40 per bushel. In May 2018, soybeans cost $9.84 per bushel. That’s a 27 percent drop. Measuring since 2011, the lowest price was $8.56 in March 2016. Tariffs and trade barriers are not pushing these prices down; record soybean plantings and record yields are the cause.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"10216, 6441, 5335, 5291, 5703, 4980, 4995, 5017, 4436","repeated_count":"9","date":"08/24/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
