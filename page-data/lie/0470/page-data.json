He [Democrat Jon Ossoff] looked like he was going to win.  He had about 56 percent of the vote.  If he gets 50, he wins, we have now a Democratic congressman. I did a robocall.  I did some tweets.  I did some interviews.  He didn't get the number, and I believe she's going win, and she might win very easily.”","analysis":"There was never any polling indicating that Democrat Jon Ossoff was going to get 56 percent of the vote in an open primary in Georgia's strongly Republican 6th Congressional District. There was a possibility he would get just over 50 percent, which would have eliminated a run-off election and been an embarrassing loss for the GOP.  Trump took credit for the Ossoff getting 48 percent, even though Republicans in the race distanced themselves from Trump as the election got closer.
