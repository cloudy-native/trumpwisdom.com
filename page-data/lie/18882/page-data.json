You know, they -- they pirate these applications, they print new voting forms, and then they send them around, people sign them, or one person signs them with different pens and a different signature every time. It's -- it's -- obviously there's going to be fraud. We're not babies. There's tremendous fraud. You have all of the harvesting. You have all of the things. They walk in at the end of a race -- we had a lot of them in California -- they walk in, Ben, at the end of a race and they dump thousand -- you think the race is over, you think somebody won, and then all of a sudden, out of the blue come thousands of votes at the very end. 'Oh, what happened?' 'Harvesting.' Wonderful thing: harvesting. They just happened to find thousands of ballots just at the end. So somebody that thought he or she was going to win the race, all of a sudden gets clipped. We can't have that.”","analysis":"Trump spins another election-fraud fantasy here. Democrats in 2018 won seven seats in Orange County, California, receiving a boost from votes tabulated after election day, predominantly from absentee and provisional ballots. California always takes a long time to count its mail-in ballots, and the results sometimes change the results in elections that were close on election night. California allows non-family members to submit other people's vote-by-mail ballots, what Trump calls \"harvesting.\" But there are careful checks in place to prevent fraud, such as verifying that the signature on a ballot matches that of the registered voter. There is no evidence any fraud was committed in those elections. Republicans in California have admitted they had not taken advantage of \"harvesting\" as much as Democrats in the state and are stepping up efforts to close the gap.
