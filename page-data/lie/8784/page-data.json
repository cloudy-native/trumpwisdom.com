But GDP growth fluctuates. It has gone up and down and into negative territory and then up again since the end of the Great Recession. GDP growth has averaged 2.8 percent per quarter so far in Trump’s presidency, not much higher than Obama’s average of 2.1 percent for his two terms in office. Trump has seen growth top 4 percent in one quarter, but Obama topped it three times during his term and in one quarter topped 5 percent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
