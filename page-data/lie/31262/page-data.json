Trump number one, Obama number two, and Joe Biden a very distant number three. That's also rather odd given the fact that on November 3rd, Biden allegedly racked up millions more votes than Trump, but can't get anywhere close to him in this poll. No incoming president has ever done as badly in this annual survey.\" @MarkSteynOnline @TuckerCarlson That's because he got millions of Fake Votes in the 2020 Election, which was RIGGED!”","analysis":"The 2020 presidential election was not rigged or stolen -- and not a hoax. Biden won a solid victory in the Electoral College, 306-232, and won a majority of the popular vote, beating Trump by more than 7 million votes. Trump and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits in six swing states, but virtually all were rejected for lack of evidence or standing, often by judges appointed by Trump. Biden’s margin of victory in many key states was significantly higher than Trump’s margin four years earlier. For instance, Biden won Michigan by more than 150,000 votes, compared with Trump’s margin of about 11,000 in 2016. Attorney General William Barr said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the election. For months leading up to the election, Trump kept falsely claiming that the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged -- making his loss a self-fulfilling prophecy.
