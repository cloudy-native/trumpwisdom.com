That was the maximum they've ever done. So I said, 'You know what we have to do? We're going to reimburse them and help them with $12 billion for the first year; $16 billion, same thing, for the second year.' And the farmers got through. And they didn't want that...We had them over at the White House in the Cabinet Room. Thirty-five farmers. And they said, 'Sir, we don't want any money. We just want a level playing field.”","analysis":"It’s difficult to imagine that the $12 billion estimate, which became U.S. policy in the form of farm subsidies, surfaced on the fly at this meeting. In any case, the Trump tariffs have garnered about $39 billion on products from China through December, according to Customs and Border Protection, and the administration has announced $28 billion in farm subsidies over two years to offset domestic producers’ losses from the trade war. That means most of the China tariff revenue has been largely eaten up by payments the government has made to farmers who lost business because China stopped buying U.S. soybeans, hogs, cotton and other products.
