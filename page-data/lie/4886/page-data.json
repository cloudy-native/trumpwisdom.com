The average increase was 25 percent. But most people were not affected since few Americans buy health insurance through the exchange marketplace — and about 70 percent of those who do are protected from premium increases through cost subsidies. Trump does not mention that premiums increased in 2018 and 2019 because of changes made to law under his administration, including repeal of the individual mandate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
