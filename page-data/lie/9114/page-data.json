I said, you got to get those forests, we can't keep spending billions and billions and losing hundreds of lives. … When a tree falls, you can't let the environmentalist say you can't take that tree out. Becomes like a matchstick that tree, it hits a flame, it goes up the leaves -- every once in a while you have to remove the leaves because they are so, a guy smoking a cigarette, he throws it away, he doesn't mean it, the thing catches on fire, we lose 400,000 acres and people are killed.”","analysis":"Experts say the wildfires besetting California were not sparked by forest management problems such as an overpopulation of trees or dead trees. Climate change, on the other hand, has made these forests more arid and likely to catch fire. Some California forests appear to have many more trees per acre than what is considered healthy, according to an expert cited by the San Francisco Chronicle. But more than half of the state’s forested land is managed by the federal government. The U.S. Forest Service says the “rising costs of fighting fires has led [it] to regularly raid its $600 million budget for forest management,” according to the Sacramento Bee. Trump is wrong to claim the federal government sends billions of dollars each year in forest-fire aid to California. The Sacramento Bee in October found “the U.S. government has spent about $1.4 billion the past two years dealing with wildfires in California.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
