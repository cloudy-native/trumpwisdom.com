Trump complains about the WHO but he repeatedly praised China's response to the coronavirus outbreak before the death toll started to mount in the USA. Then he looked for scapegoat.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
