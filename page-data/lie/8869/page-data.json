But it is smaller than the Space Force plan Trump originally conceived, which also called for a separate Department of the Space that would have been led by an appointed service secretary. It also still requires the approval of Congress.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
