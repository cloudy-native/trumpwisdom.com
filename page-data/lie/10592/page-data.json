They were ‘angry Democrats,’ as I called them. We've been through it for two years, and they spent almost $40 million on it.”","analysis":"The special counsel's investigation cost $32 million, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/02/politics/mueller-report-cost/index.html\">according to financial reports</a> released by the Justice Department. Mueller reported direct costs and also indirect costs, which no other special counsel had reported for previous investigations. He seized assets from Paul Manafort worth more than $40 million as part of the probe. Those assets now belong to taxpayers and there's a case to be made that the special counsel's investigation therefore made more money than it spent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"30830, 30771, 29796, 29879, 30261, 30461, 29205, 28071, 28180, 26236, 25377, 25088, 24539, 23433, 22335, 21341, 22666, 21173, 20692, 20514, 19758, 16686, 16089, 16005, 14917, 14357, 14372, 14416, 14184, 13763, 12958, 13679, 13003, 11776, 11097, 10745, 10787, 10718, 10438, 10449, 10453, 10959, 10961, 10592, 10570, 10533, 10852, 10932, 10363, 10150, 9785, 10116, 9660","repeated_count":"53","date":"05/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
