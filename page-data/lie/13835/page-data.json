First, the Vice President isn’t singularly in charge of foreign policy with China or any other country. So, Obama didn’t allow anyone to “rob us blind.” Secondly, Trump appears to be referring to the trade imbalance with China where he consistently misunderstands what a trade deficit means. It is not a matter of \"lost\" money or \"trillions of dollars\" being \"ripped from our nation.\" A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as currencies, economic growth, and savings and investment rates.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
