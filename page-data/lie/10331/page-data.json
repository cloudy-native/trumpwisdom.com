You know Schumer, every one of them -- I would say practically every one of them, they wanted him out, and then as soon as I -- as soon as he's gone they were all holier than thou. Oh, that's such a terrible thing to do.”","analysis":"False and misleading on several levels. Democrats did not flip flop on former FBI Director James Comey. They reacted with shock when Trump fired Comey while the FBI was investigating Trump's campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller's report says the Comey firing amounted to potential obstruction of justice by the president. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer said Nov. 2, 2016, that he had lost confidence in Comey, but Schumer stopped short of calling for Comey to be fired and instead said he wanted Comey to explain why he publicly criticized Hillary Clinton days before the presidential election over her handling of a private email server. It's false to claim \"all the Democrats\" or \"practically every one of them\" called for Comey's ouster.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
