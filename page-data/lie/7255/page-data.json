We made a great deal with Mexico.”","analysis":"Trump keeps claiming that he significantly overhauled the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). It’s not a total trade revolution, as Trump promised, but USMCA does make changes to modernize trade rules in effect from 1994 to 2020, and it gives some wins to U.S. farmers and blue-collar workers in the auto sector. Contrary to Trump's assertions, Canada’s dairy supply management system stays mostly intact, and Chapter 19, the treaty’s dispute resolution mechanism, remains in place, a win for the Canadian lumber sector. Economists and auto experts think USMCA is going to cause car prices in the United States to rise and the selection to go down. Some elements of the deal were borrowed from the Trans Pacific Partnership, the trade deal Trump scrapped at the start of his term.
