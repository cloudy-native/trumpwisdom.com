It is enumerated in the Constitution. They just 'chickened out' and didn't want to rule on the merits of the case. So bad for our Country!”","analysis":"Trump is complaining about the Supreme Court's decision to toss out the long-shot lawsuit filed by Texas and several other states, asking the court to bar four states from casting their electoral votes for Biden and to shift the selection of electors to the states’ legislatures. The court said exas lacked standing to pursue the case, saying it “has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections.” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said he would have allowed the case to be heard, for technical reasons, but he offered little hope he would have granted Trump the relief he sought.  “I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief,” Justice Alito wrote, “and I express no view on any other issue.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
