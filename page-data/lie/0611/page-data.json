Nobody else is even close. Most of them haven’t even paid anything — including funds raided out of America’s budget for the war against terrorism. That’s where they came.”","analysis":"It is incorrect that other countries have not contributed to the Green Climate Fund. In fact, 43 governments have pledged money to the fund, including nine developing countries. The countries have pledged to pay $10.13 billion collectively, and the U.S. share is $3 billion. As of May 2017, the United States has contributed $1 billion of the $3 billion it pledged.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/01/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
