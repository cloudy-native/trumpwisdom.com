But former FBI agent Peter Strzok has insisted that the reference to an insurance policy in his text to FBI lawyer Lisa Page did not mean he or fellow agents were targeting Trump. Instead, it reflected a debate about how aggressive the probe into possible Russian contacts should be. “That text represented a debate on information that we had received from an extraordinarily sensitive source and method, and that typically when something is that sensitive, if you take action on it you put it at risk,” Strzok publicly testified on July 12, 2018. The issue was whether an important source could be burned. “Given that Clinton was the ‘prohibitive favorite’ to win, Strzok said that they discussed whether it made sense to compromise sensitive sources and methods to ‘bring things to some sort of precipitative conclusion and understanding,’” the DOJ inspector general said in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4515884/DOJ-OIG-2016-Election-Final-Report.pdf#page=433\">a report</a>.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25824, 25052, 24910, 24710, 21570, 22332, 22129, 21780, 19708, 19630, 17578, 16933, 16797, 16583, 16045, 16299, 15976, 15946, 15395, 15024, 14831, 15732, 14355, 14387, 14414, 14185, 13909, 15077, 13790, 13612, 12037, 11471, 11480, 11181, 11107, 10744, 10672, 10722, 10330, 10183, 9659, 9481, 9471, 9565, 9231, 9039, 8917, 8806, 8052, 7629, 7239, 5045, 4362, 4531, 2775, 2082","repeated_count":"56","date":"12/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
