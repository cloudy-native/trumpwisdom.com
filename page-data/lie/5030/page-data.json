Clean power, right? They want to have windmills all over the place, right? When the wind doesn't blow, what do we do? Uh, we got problems. When there's thousands of birds laying at the base of the windmill, what do we do? Isn't that amazing? The environmentalists, \"We like windmills.\" Oh, really? What about the thousands of birds they're killing? Try going to the bottom of a windmill someday. It's not a pretty picture. But, really, when the wind doesn’t blow, you got problems. If your house is staring at a windmill, not good. When you hear that noise going round and round and round, and you’re living with it, and then you go crazy after a couple of years, not good. And the environmentalists say, oh, isn’t it wonderful?”","analysis":"Trump has wrapped together a slew of exaggerated claims here. As our friends <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2018/09/trump-again-overblows-risks-of-wind-power/\">at FactCheck.org reported</a>, birds are killed by turbines, but studies suggest the number is closer to five per year per turbine, not 1000s. Lack of wind can prevent turbines from generating energy, but nothing that power grids aren't equipped to handle. Finally, the noise from turbines rarely goes above sound levels that are equal to the hum of a refrigerator and so while, it may be annoying to some, there is no evidence living near a turbine would damage physical or mental health.
