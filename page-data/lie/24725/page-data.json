I executed what's called a favored nations clause. That's a killer. Nobody ever thought I'd do that. I executed -- I have the right to do it. Nobody's ever done it. No president's ever done it. That means if Germany's paying 10 cents per pill and we're paying $3 for the same pill -- and you had those kind of differences, as you probably have heard. We get it for 10 cents. We get it for the same as whoever....Now, you have a situation where they're going to come down at numbers like 50 percent, 60 percent, 70 percent.”","analysis":"Trump is hyping a largely toothless executive order. In a move widely regarded as a political play seven weeks before the election, Trump announced he had signed an executive order aiming to lower drug prices in the Medicare program through what is known as “the most favored nation policy.” If implemented, such an order would require drugmakers to accept the lowest price from the government for medicines paid by comparably wealthy countries in Europe and elsewhere — an aggressive move the pharmaceutical industry is fighting vociferously. Trump doesn't need to issue executive orders for his administration to start experimenting with new Medicare payments — but he clearly wanted to be able to claim he’s doing something on drug prices ahead of Nov. 3. (After the election, Trump announced HHS had issued an “interim final rule,\" meaning the Trump administration skipped the normal rulemaking process, which requires weeks for public comment. That could make it difficult for the Biden administration to defend the policy in court if the pharmaceutical industry sues over the rule. Indeed, in late December a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction that prevented the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, from carrying out the so-called “most favored nations” rule as scheduled on Jan. 1. The judge wrote in her temporary order that CMS had failed to follow required procedures for notice and comment before imposing such sweeping changes.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"31596, 29846, 30041, 30310, 30321, 30539, 29252, 29641, 29552, 29721, 29971, 30014, 29051, 29156, 28468, 28584, 28487, 29002, 28089, 28119, 28288, 28005, 27692, 27791, 27646, 27749, 28249, 26850, 26683, 27092, 27202, 27343, 27528, 26349, 26436, 26507, 26130, 26161, 25708, 25467, 25522, 25272, 26589, 25129, 25010, 25063, 24946, 24808, 24699, 24725, 24656, 24460, 24116, 24020, 23880, 23704, 23515, 23298, 23196, 23166, 23084, 22124, 21994, 22071, 21953, 21962, 20976, 21057, 21557, 22451, 22506, 22177, 22232, 21849, 21305, 22822, 21772, 21802, 21376, 22705, 22748, 22696, 21718, 22631, 22623","repeated_count":"85","date":"09/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
