The first time in 14 years that we cracked 3, right?”","analysis":"Trump is giving a figure that measures GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. A more traditional calculation by the Commerce Department shows 2.9 percent growth, but many economists prefer 4Q/4Q as a measure. Now that Trump is citing 4Q/4Q, that means the relevant comparison would not just be 4Q/4Q but other quarter-over-quarter calculations. The economy under Barack Obama hit its peak in 1Q/1Q 2015, when it grew 3.8 percent. Obama exceeded 3.1 percent on two other occasions, as well. Thus it’s really the best economic year-over-year growth in four years, not 14. (The GDP growth figure was later revised to 3.0, meaning it was no better than 3Q/3Q 2018.)
