The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters.... ....in the world. I want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving America’s environment. But American taxpayers – and American workers – shouldn’t pay to clean up others countries’ pollution.”","analysis":"This is a stunning misread of the protests in France, which have nothing to do with the Paris climate accord. The \"yellow vest\" protesters were angry that Macron had proposed a gas tax to pay for green policies after earlier cutting taxes for the wealthy. Trump also wrongly says American taxpayers would have been paying \"to clean up other countries' pollution\" under the Paris compact. Each country sets its own targets under the agreement, and Trump could have changed them unilaterally instead of pulling out from the deal.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30935, 30612, 30011, 28017, 28226, 27009, 26806, 27465, 26464, 26066, 25892, 24767, 24847, 23994, 23712, 23414, 23462, 23257, 23052, 22364, 20975, 21602, 22546, 21320, 21363, 21824, 22684, 21422, 21465, 21191, 22572, 21074, 17623, 17208, 16189, 16010, 15682, 15358, 14048, 12757, 12306, 11082, 11465, 11798, 10648, 10999, 10246, 9942, 7616, 7567, 6043, 6361, 5779, 5694, 5031, 4614, 4255, 4162, 2363, 1901, 1858, 1090, 0833, 0765, 0731","repeated_count":"65","date":"12/04/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
