After $35 million, with 13 -- increased to 18 -- angry Democrats, people that truly hated Donald Trump, truly hated Trump, they found no collusion whatsoever with Russia. … So after wasting all of this money and all of this time with people that were haters -- people that worked on the Hillary Clinton Foundation, people that were absolutely haters of Trump -- they found no collusion.”","analysis":"Mueller reported $25.2 million in direct and indirect costs through September 2018, a total that will likely increase when the final months' costs are tallied. Mueller also made money for the government, namely by seizing properties and assets from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort that could well defease the entire cost of his investigation in the final accounting. Trump often criticizes Mueller's team as 13 (or now, 18) angry Democrats. It's not clear to whom he's referring and what evidence he has, if any. Eleven members of Mueller's team previously had made financial contributions to Democrats' campaigns, including those of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Mueller, a Republican, could not legally take political party affiliation into account in hiring decisions. The special counsel decided not to bring charges on illegal coordination with Russia or conspiracy, but he laid out substantial evidence showing that the Russians were aiming to help Trump win, that Trump campaign members welcomed those efforts, and that Russians hacked Democrats' emails and pushed cyber-propaganda during the same period in 2016 that Trump campaign members were having a series of contacts with Russian individuals.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
