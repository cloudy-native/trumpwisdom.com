Do you remember Georgia when they said, oh we had a big flood? We had a pipeline break, a major water pipeline break. It turned out to be a false thing and everybody -- Brian, everybody ran out. They all ran out. And what's -- where's the pipeline? Guess what? There was no pipeline. That was the people where they took all of those ballots, all of those Biden ballots  under the table with the black dress and they took them and they started shoving them into the machine.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/trumps-misleading-video-proof-of-georgia-voter-fraud-fact-checker/2020/12/07/20a0395c-5dbc-4676-9b98-34f691c6abea_video.html\">a misleadingly-edited video</a> promoted by the Trump campaign, which he called “proof” of Georgia poll workers illegally stuffing and counting ballots at the State Farm Arena on Election Day. (That’s where absentee and military ballots were counted in the state.) A Trump lawyer claimed the video shows poll workers actively stuffing ballots from “suitcases” hidden under a table covered by a black cloth. (Sometimes Trump references a supposed water main break used to clear the room of poll watchers, a key focus of right-wing conspiracy theory websites. Officials have explained that a urinal had created a “little slow leak” in the arena.) The Fact Checker investigated and the surveillance video, which comprises four security camera feeds — shows no irregularities, illegal behavior or evidence of malfeasance on behalf of poll workers. The supposed “suitcases” have been repeatedly identified by election officials as the standard boxes used in Fulton County to transport and store ballots. The video also fails to show any act of hiding or obscuring any ballots or election materials. Additionally, the video shown doesn’t prove the Trump campaign’s assertion that GOP monitors were told to leave the counting room in order for poll workers to engage in illegal ballot counting. Georgia voting official Gabriel Sterling said no formal announcement to clear the room was ever made. Sterling added that the full surveillance feed shows workers handling ballots that were stored and processed in full view of the news media and partisan monitors earlier in the evening. “This is what’s really frustrating: The president’s legal team had the entire tape,” Sterling said. “They watched the entire tape. They intentionally misled the State Senate, the voters and the people of the United States about this.” Sterling's office posted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://securevotega.com/factcheck/\">a fact check</a> with excerpts from the entire tape.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31351, 31118, 31515, 31035, 30997, 31554, 31536, 30906, 30884, 30543","repeated_count":"10","date":"12/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
