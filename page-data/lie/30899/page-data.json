The highest percentage for a GOP presidential candidate -- Since 1960.”","analysis":"Exit polls only go back to 1972, but this is false. While exit polls indicate Trump received 26 percent of the non-White vote, that still would fall short of the 27 percent share that George W. Bush received in 2004. Trump earned 12 percent of the Black vote, according to exit polls, which is the same as Bob Dole in 1996 and George H.W. Bush in 1988. Trump's share of the Hispanic vote falls short of George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984. Asian Americans were not broken out until 1992, but Trump’s share is smaller than in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008. (Native American votes are not broken out in exit polls.) Trump's share of the non-White vote is not a sign of election fraud. Biden did better with White voters than did Hillary Clinton, earning 41 percent of the White vote. Given that White voters made up two-thirds of the electorate, that helped boost Biden past Trump.
