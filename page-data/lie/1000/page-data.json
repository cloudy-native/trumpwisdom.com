For example, he repeatedly claims credit for Ford’s decision to abandon its plans to open a factory in Mexico and instead expand its Michigan plant. But analysts say Ford’s decision has more to do with the company’s long-term goal — particularly, its plans to invest in electric vehicles — than the administration. It’s easier for companies to find highly skilled workers to build new products, such as electric cars, in the United States than in Mexico. Fiat Chrysler's plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"9069, 6869, 6970, 4444, 4445, 4544, 3803, 3796, 4139, 3819, 3834, 2994, 2832, 2846, 2616, 2403, 2396, 2443, 2415, 2416, 2417, 2418, 2419, 2422, 2311, 2268, 2079, 1810, 1756, 1838, 1750, 1701, 1657, 1630, 1565, 1618, 1422, 1445, 1328, 1304, 1293, 1143, 1128, 1145, 1094, 1084, 1054, 1000, 0992, 0995, 1021, 0974, 0989, 1028, 0998, 0930, 0942, 0686, 0663, 0585, 0565, 0541, 0475, 0423, 0384, 0373, 0347, 0366, 0340, 0337, 0325, 0330, 0320, 0322, 0315, 0293, 0260, 0234, 0227, 0167, 0178, 0152, 0114, 0070, 0089, 0127, 0059","repeated_count":"87","date":"08/14/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
