In the polling world, a two- or even four-percentage-point shift is relatively small. Moreover, who was running as a Democrat in 2008 and 2012? The first African American candidate, Barack Obama. Trump was not running against a black man, so that further discounts his claims of a substantial achievement. Strictly by the numbers, Trump actually did worse than any Republican running against a white man, though in effect he came close to tying George W. Bush in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1984.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/30/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
