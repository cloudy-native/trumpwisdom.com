But he also said “covid-19 causes more severe disease than seasonal influenza. … Globally, about 3.4 percent of reported covid-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1 percent of those infected.” He urged governments to expand contact tracing because it will slow the spread of infections. “We can't treat covid-19 exactly the same way we treat flu,” Tedros said, noting there would be no vaccine for some time. His remarks might have been directed at Trump. In late February and early March, Trump was still minimizing the threat posed by the coronavirus. “This is a flu. This is like a flu,” Trump said on Feb. 26. The day before Tedros’s news conference, Trump even speculated at a meeting with pharmaceutical executives that a flu vaccine would work well against the coronavirus.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
