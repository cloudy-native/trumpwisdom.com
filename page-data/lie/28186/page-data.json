Lee won many, many battles in a row and it was supposed to be over in one day. You know it was supposed to end immediately because the North was too powerful for the South. But it just shows when you have leaders, when you have a great General and Robert E. Lee, he would've won except for Gettysburg and that was because his General was killed who's going to leave Gettysburg. Never fight uphill me boys, never fight uphill. He heard they were going uphill. Stop them, stop them, but we had no cell phones in that day, right, Congressman? No cell phones, so they sent the horses to stop them, stop them, but it was too late. They fought uphill and they got slaughtered.”","analysis":"Trump attributes this \"never fight uphill\" quote to Robert E. Lee, a traitor who commanded troops of the Confederate States of America during the U.S. Civil War. Whether Lee actually said this (in the 1800s) is unclear. But this military tactic is credited to the The Art of War, an ancient Chinese military treatise attributed to Sun Tzu, written between 475 and 221 BCE. \"It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://suntzusaid.com/book/7/33/\">says the treatise</a>. It is odd, but not surprising, that Trump would instead celebrate a leader of the Confederacy when making this point.
