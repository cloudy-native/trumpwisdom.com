It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare. This will be a great campaign issue. I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes, but only after the Election when we take back the House etc. Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions!”","analysis":"Trump did say he wanted to push for a new health care bill before the election, but he backtracked after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told him such an effort was not in the cards. “We had a good conversation yesterday afternoon and I pointed out to him the Senate Republicans’ view on dealing with comprehensive health care reform with a Democratic House of Representatives,” McConnell told reporters. “I made clear to him that we were not going to be doing that in the Senate.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
