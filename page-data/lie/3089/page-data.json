And I said to my people, 'Here's the bad news. If we give them the wall, we don't have an advocate. If we don't give them the wall they're going to be putting a lot of pressure on Governor Moonbeam in California, right?' But you know what I did? Something I would normally not do, which means in life I'm getting nicer as I get older. I said, 'Let's build the wall for San Diego.' So we're building them the wall. I shouldn't have done it. Actually I, sort of, changed my mind after we started. I called my people, I said, 'How much would it cost to stop building the wall in San Diego so they go out and advocate for us because they're desperate for their wall. Because they don't like people running over their front yards and all of the problems, including by the way massive amounts of crime?' I said, 'How much would it cost to stop' -- I'm in the construction business it's what I do best. They got back to me, they said, 'Sir, it will cost approximately $7 million to stop.' Now, that's not big numbers when you hear about the numbers we talk about, $7 million to stop and restart it at a later date. I said, 'I can't do that to the American people. Keep building the wall.' Right? So we're building the wall but we're -- we're getting it all done.‚Äù","analysis":"This \"case study' is fictional. San Diego does not support construction of the wall; even the Republican mayor is opposed. The wall is not being constructed in San Diego; Trump has been unable to win funding from Congress.
