But the agricultural products -- they barely take our agriculture products. And yet, they can sell Mercedes-Benz and they can sell anything they want in our country, including their farm products. And it's not fair.”","analysis":"The E.U. is the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/europe/european-union\">third largest</a> importer of agricultural goods from the U.S. So the idea that they \"barely take our agricultural products\" is wrong. Plus, U.S. consumers buy a lot of high-value products from Europe, causing a trade deficit. Meanwhile, German automakers sold 1.35 million vehicles in the United States in 2017, about 8% of total U.S. car sales. Of those, only 494,000 were exported from Germany to the United States — 25% less than in 2013, according to the German carmakers association. Most of the remainder were made in the United States and in Mexico, which has a free trade agreement with the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"14019, 10479, 10033, 8993, 5292, 5253, 4602, 3750, 3573, 2586","repeated_count":"10","date":"04/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
