The Post <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-issued-2-million-bill-for-comatose-otto-warmbiers-care/2019/04/25/0e8022a0-66ad-11e9-a698-2a8f808c9cfb_story.html?utm_term=.f33fe92525a9\">reported</a> that North Korea submitted a $2 million bill for the hospice care of American Otto Warmbier, the comatose University of Virginia student sent home from Pyongyang in 2017. The main U.S. envoy sent to retrieve Warmbier signed an agreement to pay the medical bill on instructions passed down from Trump, according to The Post article. The bill went to the Treasury Department, where it remained — unpaid — throughout 2017. The report did not speculate about whether any payment was made since then as Trump has met twice with North Korea's leader. National Security Advisor John Bolton later confirmed The Post report.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
