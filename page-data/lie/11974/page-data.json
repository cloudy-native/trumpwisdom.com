We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question.”","analysis":"Those news reports were not fake. When the Supreme Court ruled to block the Trump administration from adding a citizenship question to the Census form, the Commerce and Justice departments said they were dropping their plans and would not seek to add the question. Trump later had his administration reverse course and try again. But as he later conceded in White House remarks, there was no viable way to add the question in time after the court's ruling, and the Trump administration desisted once again.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
