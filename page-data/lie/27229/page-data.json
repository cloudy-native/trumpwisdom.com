It was late but better late than never, but we solved and we saved Kenosha...Do you ever hear of a place called Kenosha? Because if I didn't get involved, there would be no Kenosha right now in their opinion. And I wish they called earlier, I wish we could have gotten in a little bit earlier, but that's OK. You can say what you want. I'll tell you what, I give your Governor credit.”","analysis":"Trump takes too much credit for the relative calm that has settled over Kenosha, a city roiled by protests and violence. The governor, not the president, sent the National Guard to Kenosha. And the presence of guardsmen was not the sole factor in tamping down the violence that erupted after a white police officer on Aug. 23 shot and partially paralyzed Jacob Blake in front of his children. The next day, Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin authorized the state National Guard to support local law enforcement. Maj. Gen. Paul E. Knapp, who commands the Wisconsin National Guard, noted that about 1,000 members of the state’s guard were on the scene and said it was the governor who made the final call on the guard’s deployment.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30160, 28941, 28834, 27589, 27229, 24393, 23899, 23905, 23825, 23464, 23451, 23306, 23046, 23305","repeated_count":"14","date":"10/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
