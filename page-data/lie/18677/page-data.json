Thank you! ”","analysis":"A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/235751/trump-job-approval-tying-personal-best.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> from June 2018 found that 90 percent of Republicans approve of Trump's performance. But that doesn't make him the \"most popular Republican in history.\" George W. Bush maintained an approval rating close to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/107128/bush-approval-rating-down-60-among-republicans.aspx\">99 percent</a> of Republicans during his first term after the Sept. 11 attacks. George H.W. Bush reached a high of 97 percent in 1991 after the successful conclusion of the Persian Gulf War. Ronald Reagan hit a high of 94 percent at the end of 1984, Richard Nixon a high of 91 percent in 1973 and Dwight Eisenhower a high of 95 percent in 1956. So that’s five presidents with a higher approval rating among Republicans at some point than Trump in the Gallup poll. That puts Trump in sixth place among GOP presidents since World War II. (Only Gerald Ford is lower.) Yet Trump keeps falsely claiming he has the all-time high. (Usually he says he hit 94 or 95 percent.)  But in early 2020, the impeachment trial rallied Republicans around Trump, and a Gallup poll in January showed him with an approval rating of 92 percent; one poll in October 2020 even had him at 94 percent. That jump moved him up the ranks of GOP presidents, but he still has a long way to go","pinocchios":"4","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"27050, 25623, 25135, 24145, 21528, 22978, 21382, 22629, 22578, 20902, 20632, 20471, 20531, 19993, 19985, 20140, 20128, 19856, 19745, 18924, 18961, 19695, 18914, 18896, 18931, 18677, 18507, 18511, 17115, 18370, 16915, 18228, 16697, 16408, 16138, 16168, 16059, 16245, 15864, 15922, 15018, 14491, 15796, 15773, 14756, 14747, 15758, 15650, 14150, 14321, 14157, 15483, 14314, 14071, 15161, 14269, 14216, 13937, 13495, 13477, 13381, 12716, 12774, 12617, 12916, 12512, 12353, 12036, 10821, 10822, 9178, 8813, 8532, 7949, 6694, 6301, 4639, 4649, 4496, 4235, 3899, 3652, 3648","repeated_count":"83","date":"04/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
