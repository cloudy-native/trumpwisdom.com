Later, when you return the ballot, the barcode on the envelope is scanned to acknowledge that it was received, which updates the voter history. All of that depends on workers manually updating the system, and they were usually dealing with a massive backlog of ballots and applications. That means, for example, that a ballot application could have been received days before it was processed, or a ballot could be received weeks or even months before it was marked as received. It’s not an automated system, and the data are imperfect.\"\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/04/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
