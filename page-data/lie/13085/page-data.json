I think it would be -- I think it would be advantageous to many things in the world. I think it would be a positive. Other people agree with me. And it's something that we're discussing. I don't know that we'll make a decision one way or the other, but we did have a discussion about Russia last night, as to whether or not we want to invite them back.”","analysis":"This is false. Russia was ousted from the Group of Eight (G-8) because of the invasion and annexation of Crimea, with the rest of the group of industrialized democracies saying the act was inconsistent with the “shared beliefs\" of the G-8. There had been 22 meetings of the G-7 before Russia was invited to join by then-President Bill Clinton. Then Russia attended 17 meetings before it invaded Crimea. The G-7 meeting in France later this month will be the sixth since Russia was removed. So it’s incorrect to say “most of the time” the group included Russia.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
