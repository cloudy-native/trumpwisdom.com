Experts say such a claim is far-fetched and that intelligence tying Iran deal money directly to the missiles is highly unlikely. The White House did not respond to a request for evidence. “There’s no way to corroborate that,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran policy analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “It’s such an obviously unprovable claim, I'm surprised it wasn't excised.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
