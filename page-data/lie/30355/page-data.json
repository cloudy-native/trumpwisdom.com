But Trump’s figure of 33.1 percent is an annualized figure and is pretty misleading in this context. The key fact is that the GDP was 7.4 percent higher than in the second quarter. That is indeed a record and certainly is an improvement over the stunning 9 percent decline in GDP during the second quarter. But for the economy to recover all that was lost in the previous quarter, third-quarter GDP needed to have surged by 10 percent. In other words, economic output now is 3.5 percent below the last pre-pandemic quarter. Another way to put it: The United States has recovered only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/10/29/third-quarter-gdp-economy/\">about 66 percent of its pre-coronavirus losses</a>. So, despite Trump’s happy talk, the United States is still in a deep recession.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"31247, 31110, 31570, 30330, 30355, 29758, 29857, 30134, 30182, 30225, 30457, 29180, 29259, 29316, 29391, 29462, 29654, 29483, 29577, 29727, 29987, 30074, 28708, 28882, 28902, 29059, 29065, 29174, 28608, 28685, 29015","repeated_count":"31","date":"11/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
