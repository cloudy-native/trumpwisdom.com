We signed a very, very comprehensive document.”","analysis":"North Korea has a long history of making agreements and then not living up to its obligations. The document signed by Trump and Kim was not “very comprehensive” but remarkably vague, leaving it open to interpretation and debate, compared to previous documents signed by North Korea. The statement said North Korea (officially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) committed to “work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The phrase is not defined and “toward” is rather weak. In the past, North Korea viewed “denuclearization” to mean the United States removing the nuclear umbrella it provides to Japan and South Korea; there is no indication its definition has changed.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/12/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
