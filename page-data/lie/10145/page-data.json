There is no evidence of a government conspiracy to spy on Trump's campaign. Authorities obtained a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to conduct surveillance on Carter Page after he had left the Trump campaign. The FBI counterintelligence investigation began after the bureau received a tip from the Australians. According to special counsel Robert Mueller's report: \"In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks's first release of stolen documents, a foreign government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"23036, 22981, 22945, 22960, 22904, 22905, 22873, 22874, 22664, 22634, 22645, 22630, 19785, 19738, 19705, 19671, 19649, 19485, 19445, 17555, 17519, 17196, 16796, 16298, 15906, 15996, 15925, 15394, 14745, 13854, 15486, 12653, 11410, 12040, 11451, 11891, 11265, 11870, 11180, 11773, 11744, 11106, 11080, 10651, 10950, 10763, 10574, 10134, 10135, 10145, 10153, 10077, 9973, 9843, 8054, 5013, 4770, 3314, 3255, 3240, 3256, 3155, 3157, 3178, 3231, 3239, 3143, 3210","repeated_count":"68","date":"04/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
