[quoting a tweet that reads, ‘President Zelensky has repeatedly said there was no pressure to investigate @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's political rivals.

Nowhere in the interview did Zelensky say that his American counterpart did “nothing wrong.” In fact, he criticized Trump’s comments about corruption in Ukraine and his decision to suspend military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky also questioned Trump's decision to freeze military aid, casting it as a matter of “fairness.” The Ukrainian president, moreover, faces a dilemma in discussing what he thought about the call. He does not want to get on Trump's bad side -- and he does not want to appear weak back home. In any case, Trump left out the rest of Zelensky's comments on a quid pro quo: \"I never talked to the President from the position of a quid pro quo. That’s not my thing. … I don't want us to look like beggars. But you have to understand. We're at war. If you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. I think that’s just about fairness. It’s not about a quid pro quo. It just goes without saying.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
