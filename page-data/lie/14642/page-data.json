But it was unconventional but they fought for a few days and it was pretty vicious, and the Kurds, who are our friends and Turkey's our friend, but they fought. It was tougher, I mean it was nasty, and you couldn't make a deal for 15, think of it, for 15 years, 20 years, they couldn't make a deal [between the two].”","analysis":"There's no basis for Trump's claim about the Turkish-Kurd ceasefire. This was only a five-day ceasefire. At various times he has suggested that \"everyone\" has been trying to get this deal for \"10 years,\" \"15 years\" or even \"decades.\" Experts said Trump's statement was nonsense, but it's typical of how he tries to spin minor events into earth-shattering achievements. In this case, the ceasefire was necessary because Trump removed U.S. troops, allowing for an invasion of Kurdish areas in Syria  by Turkish forces.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"14634, 14344, 14117, 14270, 14508, 14511, 14517, 14520, 14572, 14642","repeated_count":"10","date":"10/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
