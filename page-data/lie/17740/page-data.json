So far, nobody’s been able to find any money that was spent on infrastructure.”","analysis":"Perhaps Trump has forgotten about those controversial signs across the nation that touted projects being built with money from President Barack Obama’s $840 billion stimulus law? “Putting America Back to Work — Project Funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,” the signs read. The law provided tax cuts and paid for social programs, so infrastructure spending was probably only one-tenth of the total. But the evidence the money was spent is clear. The Trump administration has deleted the Web pages at the Transportation Department that used to proclaim the law “initiated more than 13,000 projects through the Federal Highway Administration, improving more than 42,000 miles of road and more than 2,700 bridges.” Trump had praised the bill for its mix of provisions when it was approved. “Well, I think taxes are very good. I think it goes quickly. It is easily done, and etc., etc.,” Trump told Fox News in 2009, “but building infrastructure, building great projects, putting people to work in that sense is also very good, so I think you have a combination of both, plus he is doing a rebate system and I think that is good also.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
