The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress.”","analysis":"Trump tweeted a similar claim in March, citing a study from the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports more restrictive immigration policies. Essentially, the claim that the wall pays for itself turns on three numbers: a) estimated savings from each undocumented immigrant blocked by the wall, b) the total number of undocumented immigrants stopped over 10 years and, and c) the cost of the wall.\n\nIt’s (a) $75,000 multiplied by (b) 160,000 to 200,000 equals (c) $12 billion to $15 billion. So, if the wall actually costs $25 billion, the number of undocumented immigrants halted by the wall would need to be doubled, or one has to assume it would take 20 years to earn the money back. But other experts offer different estimates for each of those numbers.\n\nPlus, as we've previously reported, the wall would do little to stop drugs from entering the United States, since they primarily come in through legal points of entry, making the cost of illegal drugs irrelevant to this issue.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31475, 21854, 21391, 21437, 19398, 19152, 18027, 16849, 12684, 11032, 10489, 10262, 10098, 9897, 9778, 9811, 9611, 9240, 8971, 8983, 8937, 8820, 8845, 8794, 8747, 8448, 8531, 8482, 8491, 8506, 8386, 8023, 7789, 7795, 8234, 8242, 8248, 8039, 8093, 7769, 8071, 7755, 7975, 7954, 7858, 7712, 7697, 7702, 7681, 7684, 7653, 7656, 7480, 7575, 7264, 7119, 7156, 6811, 6906, 6601, 6766, 7082, 5472, 4581, 3451, 3490, 3845, 3175, 2834, 2748, 2641, 2630, 2922, 2598, 2652, 2411, 2335, 2099, 2121, 2056, 2066, 2052, 2094, 2103, 1998, 2000, 2004, 1994, 1952, 1775, 1572, 1407, 1414, 1458, 1449, 1478, 1395, 1194, 1138, 1137, 1034, 1136","repeated_count":"102","date":"01/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
