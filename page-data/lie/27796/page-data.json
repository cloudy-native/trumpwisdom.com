Remember? And you remember all the department stores. Many of them are wiped out because of the internet, but these are minor details. Right? But all the department stores, they'd say, 'Happy New Year,' and everything but Christmas, they don't wanna say, 'Christmas.' I said, \"We're gonna say, 'Christmas,' again.\" And you know what? They're all saying, 'Christmas' again. They're saying, 'Merry Christmas.' They're all saying, 'Merry Christmas,' again.”","analysis":"This claim is a strange favorite of the president's. There is no evidence that stores stopped using Merry Christmas in their advertising, were \"ashamed\" to do so or that any of this changed since Trump took office.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30893, 29550, 28895, 28121, 27796, 27862, 27164, 16615, 16418, 16244","repeated_count":"10","date":"10/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
