And he was thanking everybody. I call my wife; I say, 'Darling, come. I'm so proud of this. Come in, I'm sure he's going to say nice things.' He never mentioned my name. 'I want to thank the Reverend Al Sharpton.' Al Sharpton? I didn't even know he was involved. 'I want to thank...' -- people that I never even heard of. He was thanking people -- he never mentioned my name. So I had somebody call him and say, just -- 'You don't have to do that, but -- if it's so tough. Not fair. But, you know, you should do it.' He apologized. He said he made a mistake.”","analysis":"Van Jones <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/14/politics/fact-check-trump-february-86-false-claims/index.html\">told CNN</a>, \"Never happened.\" ","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/07/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
