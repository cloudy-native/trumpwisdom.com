They're the dumbest laws anywhere in the world. Dumbest immigration laws anywhere in the world. There's nothing -- catch-and-release. You know what catch-and-release is? You catch a criminal, you take his name, and you release him. Release him. You know where we release him? Into the United States. Supposed to come back for a trial two or three years later because the judges -- you know, you need thousands of judges. How do you have judges for that many people? It's so ridiculous. Another country doesn't do that. They say, ‘I'm sorry, I can't come in. You can't come in.’ Once they set a foot on our land, it's like, ‘Welcome to the United States.’”","analysis":"This is a misleading description of catch and release. It mostly applies to children and refugees seeking asylum. Those with criminal records are not eligible for asylum or release. Of the asylum applicants who are released while their cases are pending in immigration courts, more than two-thirds of those people show up for their court dates, according to the Center for Immigration Studies, although some do not and remain in the country without authorization. The U.S. may need more than the 334 or so immigration judges currently in place to tackle the massive backlog of claims, but thousands of judges is a huge exaggeration. Many other countries have independent government officials adjudicating asylum claims, like the U.S. The U.S. has some of the toughest immigration laws in the world, written by both Democrats and Republicans.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26946, 26835, 26671, 27144, 26210, 26327, 25697, 25568, 25438, 25356, 24434, 24097, 23680, 21591, 22455, 18863, 17785, 16549, 16205, 16476, 16347, 14676, 12687, 11639, 11954, 11939, 11899, 11850, 11141, 11719, 10877, 10263, 10006, 9890, 9645, 9705, 9536, 9297, 9140, 9141, 8852, 8451, 8498, 8324, 8280, 8167, 8195, 8216, 8217, 8223, 7891, 7893, 7910, 7911, 7912, 7148, 7077, 7078, 7079, 7081, 6537, 6557, 6644, 6202, 6386, 6161, 6425, 6486, 5899, 5818, 4401, 4288, 4525, 3892, 3460, 3847, 3945, 3955, 3917, 3936, 3318, 3270, 3202, 3172, 3122, 3083, 2816, 2829, 2695","repeated_count":"89","date":"10/23/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
