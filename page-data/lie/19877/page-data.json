And they would come up here, and I got to actually know them. And the first year they came, I thought it was a normal meeting. They were asking for a lot of money, which they were having a hard time getting from previous administrations, and we got it for them. The next year they came back, I said, 'Oh, what are you guys back for?' He said, 'Well, we want the money again.' I said, 'Aren't we working long-term deals?' 'No.' And you got the money. And then the third time, I said, 'I see. You come... 'So they made you for years -- many years -- for decades, they had to come back, keep coming back, keep coming back. Not like a lot of others. 'Will they get it?' And they kept coming back and asking for money. And I said, 'What's this all about? Why do you have to come every year? Why don't we make a longer-term deal?' And we made, I think, a 10-year deal. And they were all funded up, and they were all set. And that's historically black colleges and universities. And they play a tremendous function. I got to be friendly with some of them. I won't tell you what some of them said -- how bad it was about the past administration and past administrations. But they were treated very, very badly, and I treated them very good.”","analysis":"Trump regularly touts his support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), often with a lengthy, anecdotal story that appears to be invented and has little basis in reality. He's referring to bipartisan legislation, dubbed the FUTURE Act, that the Congress passed in December, 2019. The legislation extended $255 million in annual STEM funding for minority-serving colleges, including roughly $85 million specifically allocated to HBCUs. Obama had put in place <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-signs-executive-order-promoting-excellence-innovation-and-sustainab\">a ten-year programming stream</a> but Trump had let it lapse. (Trump often makes it sound as if Obama refused to do this and Trump had to come to the rescue.) Moreover, the funding for HBCUs is a congressional initiative. “Congress does all this work and presents it to him in the budget, and he can choose to sign it. This year [2019], he held off on signing some significant STEM funding, making HBCUs beg for it,” said Marybeth Gasman, a Rutgers professor and one of the leading authorities on HBCUs. “Most HBCU support is the result of Congress. Trump has promised all kinds of things to HBCUs and has followed through on little. Under Trump, the White House Initiative for HBCUs was moved to the White House and is quite quiet compared to the work under President Obama’s administration.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Education","repeated_ids":"30380, 29833, 29919, 30295, 30322, 30528, 29304, 29379, 28282, 27002, 26734, 26768, 27277, 27548, 26386, 26322, 25413, 25318, 25371, 25215, 25079, 24958, 23480, 23267, 23118, 22116, 22078, 21937, 21914, 22466, 21890, 22137, 21349, 21276, 20667, 20110, 20060, 19983, 20218, 20190, 20197, 19877, 20315, 19879, 19880, 19878","repeated_count":"46","date":"06/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
