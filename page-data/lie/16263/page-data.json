I can't have stock. They considered the conflict of interest, and that I can't understand, I mean, I can't.”","analysis":"These claims from Trump — who has declined to release his tax returns or divest from his business — should be taken with a grain of salt. Trump’s transition team claimed in December 2016 that he had sold all his stocks. A January 2017 white paper from Trump’s attorneys said, “President-Elect Trump has already disposed of his investments in publicly traded or easily liquidated investments.” A year and a half later, Trump reported at least $250,000 in income from stocks in his 2018 financial disclosure form, specifically listing Apple, Caterpillar, Halliburton, Microsoft, PepsiCo, Phillips 66 and a publicly traded New Jersey textile company now named Global Fiber Technologies. Then, in his 2019 financial disclosure form, Trump no longer listed income from stocks in these or any companies. The president perhaps was advised he couldn't hold stocks while in office, but the law itself is unclear, and his disclosure forms indicate he owned stocks anyway until 2019, well into his presidency. The president and vice president are not considered federal employees and technically are not subject to federal ethics rules or criminal penalties covering conflicts of interest. Former presidents such as George W. Bush and Bill Clinton placed their investments, including stocks, in a blind trust.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
