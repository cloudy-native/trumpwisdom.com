When you have Cigna, Aetna, Humana, Anthem going up 270, 420, 470 percent, 480 percent, these are insurance companies that went up 480 percent since Obamacare.  Is any stock on the stock exchange - has anybody gone up that much?”","analysis":"This claim is false. Insurance companies have actually lost billions in the Obamacare exchanges, according to company filings and industry analysts. For example, Aetna is on pace to lose $750 million from its participation in the exchanges — $100 million in 2014, $150 million in 2015, $300 million in 2016 and more than $200 million in 2017. As a result, it is not participating in 2018, a spokesman said. Humana announced it would leave the exchanges, saying it was too risky after losing $45 million in the individual market in 2017.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"1372, 1425, 1370, 1373, 1403, 1404, 1438, 1371, 1470","repeated_count":"9","date":"10/17/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
