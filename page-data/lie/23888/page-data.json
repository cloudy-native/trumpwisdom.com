Winston Churchill stood on the rooftops in London very calm, making speeches, Winston Churchill. You want calmness, you don't want somebody that's going to be jumping up and down. I could do that too, I could jump up and down, say oh this is terrible, this is terrible. … We don't want panic.”","analysis":"Trump <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump/2020/09/09/0368fe3c-efd2-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html\">called</a> journalist Bob Woodward in February 2020 and \"revealed that he thought the [coronavirus] situation was far more dire than what he had been saying publicly.\" The conversation was not made public until months later, when Woodward published his book, \"Rage.\" “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed,” Trump said in a Feb. 7 call. “And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.” At that time, Trump was telling the nation that the virus was no worse than a seasonal flu, predicting it would soon disappear and insisting that the U.S. government had it totally under control. It would be several weeks before he would publicly acknowledge that the virus was no ordinary flu and that it could be transmitted through the air. It was not until a month later, in a subsequent interview in March, that Trump told Woodward he falsely minimized the coronavirus's risks because he wanted to maintain calm. Later, Trump began to compare himself to Britain's stalwart leader during World War II, Sir Winston Churchill, claiming that Churchill would give speeches projecting calm while bombs fell on his country.
