We are renovating vast areas of wall that collapsed, but it's good if you renovate, you save a lot of money by renovating it. But -- and we are taking down the wall and putting up new wall, some areas you can't renovate. But we'll have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year which is very quick. It’s rapidly approaching.”","analysis":"All told, Congress has funded about 175 miles of barriers (not concrete walls). Trump has also tapped a Treasury Department asset forfeiture fund to build 30 miles and unused Pentagon funding to fund 53 miles. That adds up to a little under 260 miles, which Trump-speak often gets translated to 400 miles.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"21776, 20014, 20307, 20761, 19400, 19242, 17875, 18026, 17437, 17287, 17399, 15966, 13550, 12791, 13667, 13133, 12310, 11477, 11482, 11439, 11253, 11200","repeated_count":"22","date":"06/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
