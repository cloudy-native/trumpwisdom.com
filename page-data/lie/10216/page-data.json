And you know they've been going down for 15, 20 years a long time.”","analysis":"Trump goes further than he normally does. Usually, he claims soybean prices had dropped 50 percent in the five years before his election. But the price of soybeans has not dropped 50 percent since five years before the election, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. In 2011, five years before the 2016 election, soybeans peaked at $13.40 per bushel. In May 2018, soybeans cost $9.84 per bushel. That’s a 27 percent drop. Measuring since 2011, the lowest price was $8.56 in March 2016. Tariffs and trade barriers are not pushing these prices down; record soybean plantings and record yields are the cause. While Trump lauds the patriotism of farmers, he also authorized $12 billion in aid to assist for losses from his tariffs.
