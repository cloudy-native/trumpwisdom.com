Iran used to bar inspectors from certain Western countries and would occasionally deny visas to IAEA personnel investigating the possible military dimensions of its nuclear program. Now as the deal was implemented, Iran issued long-term, multiple-entry visas to inspectors.  The IAEA can request access to any Iranian facility if it has evidence of nuclear activities occurring there, but inspectors have not used that authority to attempt to investigate military areas since the deal was implemented -- which some experts said indicated that the agency was too cautious.
