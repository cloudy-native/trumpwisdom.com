In addition, you'll have a lot of cars come off the market that are 10, 12, 15 years old that are very bad for the environment and that, you know, chug a lot of fuel, because those people driving those cars don't want to switch to one of the cars that they're producing right now. Number one, they're too expensive. Number two, they're not nearly as safe. They're lighter, much thinner, much more flimsy. And we're able to produce a sturdier car, which is safer, and we're -- we're able to do something that will cost substantially less money for the consumer.”","analysis":"Trump is arguing against higher fuel efficiency standards by making an economic and safety argument rejected by many experts and that most automakers do not want. The rule to rollback Obama-era standards being written by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposal has nothing to do with making new cars safer; in fact, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://apnews.com/1a7551fca3294ec49029b93e994cd7f9\">internal EPA emails released in 2018</a> said the rule change would increase highway fatalities. He also falsely claims there would be little environmental impact. Experts say any potential savings on the sticker price of new cars would likely be offset by the increased fuel cost over the life of those vehicles, even if gas prices stay low. With less fuel-efficient cars, the rollback could also introduce hundreds of millions of metric tons of CO2 into the air, and increase oil consumption by more than 1 billion barrels, according to the EPA’s own estimates.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"28785, 21179, 19167, 17746, 17443, 16543, 15827, 14784, 13542, 12786, 12812, 13735, 13150, 12559, 12566, 12567","repeated_count":"16","date":"09/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
