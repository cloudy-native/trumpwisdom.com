You can't compare this to 1918, where close to 100 million people died. That was a flu — it’s a little different — but that was a flu where if you got it, you had a 50/50 chance or very close of dying. I think we're substantially under 1 percent because the people that get better are not reporting.”","analysis":"Trump appeared to be countermanding his coronavirus task force coordinator, Deborah Birx, who had just said, “I think what’s really important is a lot of what we've done is tackled this epidemic the way people said we should’ve tackled flu in 1918.” But his numbers don't add up. Estimates of the 1918 flu deaths vary widely — it was a century ago, and the data is not especially precise — but the 50 percent fatality rate Trump gave does not appear in any of the scientific literature. The CDC <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-pandemic-h1n1.html\">estimated</a> that 500 million people were infected and 50 million died worldwide from the 1918 pandemic, a fatality rate of 10 percent. A 2018 study in the American Journal of Epidemiology estimated 17.4 million deaths globally and a mortality rate of 8 to 10 percent. A 2002 report in the Bulletin of the History of Medicine <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11487892_Updating_the_Accounts_Global_Mortality_of_the_1918-1920_Spanish_Influenza_Pandemic\">estimated</a> 50 million deaths but said that total could be “perhaps as much as 100 percent understated.” So, the 2002 study suggests a range between 50 million and 100 million deaths. Other studies suggest the fatality rate was as low as 3 percent. The U.S. death rate for coronavirus cases was above 1 percent, more than 10 times that of the seasonal flu, when Trump made these remarks.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
