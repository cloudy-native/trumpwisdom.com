Those are the biggest orders in the history of this country -- probably the history of the world.”","analysis":"The administration’s numbers are inflated. A review of the deals shows that many are not concluded and are simply aspirational. Moreover, many of the investments are in Saudi Arabia, making it difficult to argue that these will create many jobs for Americans. Other deals, such as the SoftBank fund and ExxonMobil Chemical deal in Texas, had been announced months earlier and thus are not appropriate for inclusion on a list of achievements from the president’s visit.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"17202, 15050, 13631, 11933, 11250, 10870, 10250, 7307, 7527, 7542, 7248, 7256, 7258, 7231, 6188, 6189, 6205, 6207, 6330, 6331, 6136, 6416, 6420, 6446, 6447, 6125, 6131, 5938, 5939, 5967, 5866, 5870, 5935, 6063, 2706, 0832, 0832, 0704, 0643, 0630, 0618, 0588","repeated_count":"42","date":"10/17/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
