Remember, “It’s the economy stupid.” Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will!”","analysis":"This is false. In recent years -- when public opinion polling became the norm -- Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and George W. Bush experienced roughly similar low unemployment rates as Trump but their approval percentages ranged from the low 20s to the high 30s. Moreover, Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1998 when the economy -- and the nation's fiscal position -- was arguably in better shape than today. Clinton presided over very low unemployment, strong economic growth, and the government had a budget surplus.
