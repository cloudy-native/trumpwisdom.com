You know that is? That's when you catch a criminal, murderer, rapist, you let the criminal go. We argued about this during the debate. He said, 'They all come back for a trial.' No, they don't come back Joe. Only the ones I said with very low IQs come back. You have a trial in two and a half years for murder.”","analysis":"We are not entirely clear what Trump is trying to say here, but he appears to be mashing together a couple separate immigration issues. The first, which he calls ‘catch and release’ applies when someone first appeals for asylum. Following the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees: A refugee enters and makes a petition, and the government makes a ruling after analyzing the facts. It's also worth keeping in mind that 85 percent of all deportations in the United States are ordered quickly, without a hearing before a judge. (Justice Department data show the vast majority of non-detained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings. For asylum-seekers, data suggests the return rate is even higher.) The second issue is when states and local governments do not alert federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. Some criminals have been released in jurisdictions that don't comply with ICE detainer requests, but although the research is limited, there is little difference in crime rates between cities that comply with requests and those that don't.
