FAIRNESS?”","analysis":"A jury convicted Stone after a trial. He faced seven counts of lying to Congress, obstructing a federal investigation and tampering with a witness. Trump often falsely accuses James Comey of leaking classified documents, but an investigation by the Justice Department inspector general cleared Comey of that allegation. It's not clear what Trump means with \"forged documents,\" but none of the people he mentioned were accused of forgery.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
