And that’s not by accident; that’s because we did a lot of hard work, and it's going to continue to go down. And we're finally getting drug prices down for the American people...we lowered prescription drug prices, the first time in 50 years. They want to see that. The Democrats would never have been able to do that.”","analysis":"Trump overstates what happened to the consumer price index for prescription drugs. It fell by 0.6 percent for the 12 months ending Dec. 2018, the first time in 46 years, not \"over 50 years.\"  Moreover, the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUSR0000SEMF01?output_view=pct_12mths\">says</a> there are other 12-month periods with index declines including one as recently as 2013. Trump also falsely suggests this would not have ever happened under Democrats -- when in fact it did.
