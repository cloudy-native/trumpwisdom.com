It's been done with South Korea for a long time. It's been done for about two months. And we'll do a ceremonial signing over the next very short period of time. But that was another thing in the book that was just totally false. I mean, there was no -- it was actually a very reasonable deal and a fairly easy deal to make. It was a horrible deal to start off with for the United States. It was made by somebody that I happened to be running against at the time. And she made a deal that took a lot of jobs out of the United States, and we're making a deal that's going to bring a lot of jobs to the United States. But I've concluded the deal in South Korea, which is the deal that was referred to. And I think it's going to be a great deal.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to a free-trade agreement with South Korea that was negotiated by the President George W.
