I did it anyway, and we saved hundreds of thousands of lives.”","analysis":"The Trump administration imposed an entry ban on all foreign nationals who were in the People’s Republic of China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, in the previous 14 days, effective Feb. 2. Trump frequently claims he took bold action that was criticized, but news reports say he had been reluctant to impose the ban, citing his relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but the action was urged by his top health advisers. Moreover, many U.S. airlines already were canceling flights. We do not know Fauci's specific stance internally on the matter but there is ample reason to doubt Trump's claim. In public, Fauci has said the restrictions helped slow the spread of the virus in the United States.
