But in the courtroom, his claims were dismissed as false or lacking evidence. U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann, who had long been active in GOP circles, criticized the Trump campaign for failing to provide evidence to justify blocking Pennsylvania from certifying its election results. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/45/2020/11/Order-Granting-MTD.pdf\">Dismissing the case</a>, Brann wrote: “One might expect that when seeking such a startling outcome, a plaintiff would come formidably armed with compelling legal arguments and factual proof of rampant corruption.” Brann continued, “Instead, this Court has been presented with strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations, unpled in the operative complaint and unsupported by evidence.”  After the Trump campaign appealed Brann’s decision to the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, a three-judge panel <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/203371np.pdf\">unanimously upheld</a> the lower court ruling. Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee, wrote: “Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31267, 31021, 31078, 30985, 30805, 30860, 31446","repeated_count":"7","date":"12/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
