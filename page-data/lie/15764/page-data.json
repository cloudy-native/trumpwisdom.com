Now the Witch Hunt continues with local New York Democrat prosecutors going over every financial deal I have ever done. This has never happened to a..... .....President before.

The New York Times reported in 2018 that Trump committed fraud to skip some tax bills, enhancing the value of his inheritance. Mueller spent nearly $35 million and seized tens of millions of dollars in funds for the government as part of Paul Manafort's prosecution.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
