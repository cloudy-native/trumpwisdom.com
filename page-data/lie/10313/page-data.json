What’s “worse” is open to interpretation. It could mean cost, damage or lives lost, but regardless of how you measure, several lists suggest that more recent hurricanes were the “worst” or “biggest,” including Hurricanes Maria and Harvey, which hit in 2017. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history. At least 6,000 people were killed, and 30,000 people in the Texas city were left homeless. Oddly, when Trump asserted in 2017 that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/09/20/president-trumps-claim-that-weve-had-bigger-storms-than-harvey-and-irma/?utm_term=.2fbe1b44fe45\">hurricanes in the 1930s and 1940s were “bigger” than more recent storms</a>, his staff directed The Fact Checker to a report issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That report was updated in 2018, and it shows that the costliest storms, adjusted for inflation, are Katrina (2005), Harvey (2017), Maria (2017), Sandy (2012) and Irma (2017). So three of the costliest storms occurred on Trump’s watch.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"10313, 5953, 5448","repeated_count":"3","date":"06/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
