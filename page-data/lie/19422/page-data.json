Plus, experts are wary of putting too much weight on anecdotal reports of the drug's success. The decades-old medication is used to fight malaria, as well as to ease discomfort for patients with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, has not been approved to combat covid-19 and can cause serious side effects. Raoult's study, which had not yet been peer reviewed when it was published, was pulled by {the science journal} that originally printed it for failing to meet scientific standards.
