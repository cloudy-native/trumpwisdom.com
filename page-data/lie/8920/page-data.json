Bush or Republicans of Bill Clinton, just to name of few recent examples. President John Tyler was actually ousted by his party (the Whigs) while Andrew Johnson and Clinton were impeached. As for media coverage, Trump regularly appears to believe it should only be positive. He has offered little evidence the media is \"corrupt.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
