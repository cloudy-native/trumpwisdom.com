The Free and Fair Press is gone in our country. They only write about what they want to write about. SUPPRESSION! ”","analysis":"This comment was over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/mzhemingway/status/1327770735952207873\">a tweet</a> by a conservative writer, who had remarked that at a pro-Trump rally in Washington, DC, there was \"widespread anti-media sentiment today, on account of their lies about Trump and outspoken hostility to Trump supporters.\" That's a matter of opinion but Trump's comment repeats the slander that there is no \"free and fair press\" and that it engages in suppression of news. The reality is that news organizations aim to confirm information -- such as allegations about Hunter Biden -- rather than just report claims that may turn out to be false.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"31301, 31041, 31007, 30888, 31449, 30639","repeated_count":"6","date":"11/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
