He could have unilaterally changed the commitments offered by Barack Obama, which is technically allowed under the accord. Plus, as we've noted before, Trump ignores any possible benefits that could come from tackling climate change, including potential green jobs.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30935, 30612, 30011, 28017, 28226, 27009, 26806, 27465, 26464, 26066, 25892, 24767, 24847, 23994, 23712, 23414, 23462, 23257, 23052, 22364, 20975, 21602, 22546, 21320, 21363, 21824, 22684, 21422, 21465, 21191, 22572, 21074, 17623, 17208, 16189, 16010, 15682, 15358, 14048, 12757, 12306, 11082, 11465, 11798, 10648, 10999, 10246, 9942, 7616, 7567, 6043, 6361, 5779, 5694, 5031, 4614, 4255, 4162, 2363, 1901, 1858, 1090, 0833, 0765, 0731","repeated_count":"65","date":"07/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
