But other people lied too. Just to mention, Comey lied. McCabe lied. Lisa Page lied. Her lover, Strzok -- Peter Strzok -- lied. You don't know who these people are? Just trust me, they all lied. You had people that forged documents … and leaking classified documents.”","analysis":"The difference is that Stone faced seven counts of lying to Congress, obstructing a federal investigation and tampering with a witness. Trump often falsely accuses James Comey of leaking classified documents, but an investigation by the Justice Department inspector general cleared Comey of that allegation. It's not clear what Trump means with \"forged documents,\" but none of the people he mentioned were accused of forgery.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
