Nobody can even believe it. In fact, when I first heard the number, I said, 'That can’t be real.' We lost anywhere from 6 [million] to 7 million jobs over a relatively short period of time.”","analysis":"Trump is likely referring to the number of U.S. factory closures and job losses since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, a talking point he often uses. These remarks were made during a discussion of new China tariffs. The number for factory closures is accurate, but to suggest China was the only factor is misleading. Economists say automation and other forces also played a role. The number for job losses is seriously exaggerated. Official government data show 4.3 million to 4.7 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost after China joined the WTO -- but, again, although China had a big role, it's misleading to blame it all on them.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
