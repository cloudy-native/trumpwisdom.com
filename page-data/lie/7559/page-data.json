And he decided not to live there, which was illegal. So I'm sure they'll look into that situation. He did such a bad job in Newark that he didn't live there.”","analysis":"Booker was mayor of Newark from 2006 to 2013 and lived in the city the whole time. He had a mixed record on crime and education. But he was in office during the recession and left the city with healthier finances, pulled in hundreds of millions of dollars in private investments, and saw the city's population increase after a long trend of decline. The most common substantive criticism is that Booker didn't do enough to improve the city, not that things got worse.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/28/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
