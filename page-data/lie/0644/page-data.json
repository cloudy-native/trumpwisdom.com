You just take a look at that -- 700,000 jobs have been created in a very short period of time since the election, 700,000 jobs.”","analysis":"Trump made a similiar claim about the stock market in his February speech to Congress, which refers back to when he was elected in November, but the stock market has been mostly flat from February to June. The number of private-sector jobs created since Trump became president is about 600,000, as of June 2017. Trump appears to be counting jobs created since he was elected, so he's adding in jobs created under Barack Obama.
