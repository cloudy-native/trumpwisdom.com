The President has been crystal clear: no quid pro quo’s of any kind.' That says it ALL!”","analysis":"Sondland sent a text message to another diplomat via WhatsApp, not a tweet, after the diplomat wrote: “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\" Sondland then urged the diplomat to have a phone conversation rather than continue to leave a paper trail. Nevertheless, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has said that Sondland also told him that release of the aid was contingent upon Ukraine opening the requested investigations — but that Trump denied it when Johnson asked him if that was true. Sondland later amended his testimony to acknowledge telling one of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s advisers that resumption of U.S. aid was tied to an anti-corruption pledge sought by Trump.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
