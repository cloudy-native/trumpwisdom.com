However, the poverty rate has being declining steadily since it peaked during the recession — well before Trump considered running for president. Scholars increasingly believe that the official poverty estimate is somewhat misleading and not especially informative. This is in large part because transfer payments — such as the earned-income tax credit or food stamps — are not recorded as income, so their impact isn’t incorporated into the official figure. To assuage these concerns, the Census Bureau introduced a second poverty measure in 2011 — the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which made no statistically significant changes.
