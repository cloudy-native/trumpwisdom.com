I got along great with the NATO leaders, even getting them to pay $130 Billion a year more, & $400 Billion a year more in 3 years. No increase for U.S., only deep respect!”","analysis":"Trump is incorrectly adding together two numbers. Since 2006, each NATO member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending. Defense expenditures for NATO countries other than the United States have been going up — in a consistent upward slope — since 2014. That’s when NATO decided to boost spending in response to Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region. NATO estimates that European NATO and Canada will add $130 billion in cumulative defense spending through 2020, in 2015 dollars, as an increase over 2016 spending. NATO also estimates the cumulative figure will rise to $400 billion through 2024. But Trump adds the two numbers together to come up with a fanciful $530 billion. In this particular tweet, he absurdly claims that the figure is a yearly increase, rather than $400 billion over eight years.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"17338, 16791, 16645, 16132, 16042, 16360, 15927, 15240, 15011, 15015, 14485, 14490, 14631, 15218, 15807","repeated_count":"15","date":"12/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
