Only two of the prosecutors worked for special counsel Robert Mueller. The sentencing recommendation was a public filing to a court; it wasn't \"exposed.\" Multiple courts ruled the Mueller investigation, which was authorized by a Trump appointee, was legal. The Department of Justice inspector general found that the Russia investigation was properly started.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/11/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
