Democrats have slowed the pace of confirmation for administration positions, though Trump also has been slow to name people to posts. It's doubtful that 350 people have been waiting more than two years. First, Trump has not been president for two years. Second, he had trouble making timely confirmations. As of Dec. 23, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-administration-appointee-tracker/database/?utm_term=.61e5bf8de2af\">The Washington Post tracker of 707 key administration positions</a> showed 380 people had been confirmed, 195 were awaiting confirmation, nine were announced but had not been formally nominated and 126 positions still had no nominee.
