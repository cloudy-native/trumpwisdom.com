Then, he deleted the tweet and reposted it with the word \"applications\" added in. But the White House did not offer proof that Michigan's plans ran afoul of any laws. The state has vote-by-mail in its constitution. Michigan is sending out applications for absentee ballots in a move that the Republican National Committee says is kosher.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
