They come through the weak spots.”","analysis":"Trump often describes the border as a lawless, unguarded and open. But it is heavily guarded, hundreds of miles are fenced, and the central issue is Central American refugees who are not necessarily trying to cross illegally. Tens of thousands of Central American migrants seeking entry to the United States are presenting themselves at legal ports of entry every year or turning themselves in on purpose to authorities after crossing illegally so they can file asylum claims. Furthermore, any wall would be built a mile or so inland from the border. Many of those attempting to immigrate are Central Americans seeking asylum. To petition for asylum, a person needs to be on U.S. soil under current law. So in theory, immigrants could cross the border and file a legally valid petition for asylum before reaching Trump's wall. The incentive would still exist, and so would the tunnels and visa overstays.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
