But the official rate does not necessarily tell the whole story. What also matters is the actual tax a company pays, after deductions and tax benefits -- the effective tax rate. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41743.pdf\">According to the Congressional Research Service</a>, the effective rate for the United States was 27.1 percent, compared to an effective GDP-weighted average of 27.7 percent for the OECD.
