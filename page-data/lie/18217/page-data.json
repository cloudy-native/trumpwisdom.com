The FBI had debunked the Steele Dossier in January of 2017, and then even after they did that, even after they knew from the CIA & from their own sources, they knew that Carter Page was not the agent of....a foreign power, engaged in clandestine intelligence activities, and yet they still asked for the renewal, two more times, and it gave the right for the government to rifle through the Trump campaigns files, & Emails, Text messages.....’ So how bad & illegal is that? @FoxNews”","analysis":"The Justice Department inspector general conducted an after-action review and found more than a dozen significant errors but no intentional misconduct in FBI officials' applications to a court for secret surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser, Carter Page. The warrant was renewed three times by the court. \"The fact that the FBI believed Steele had been retained to conduct political opposition research did not require the FBI, under either DOJ or FBI policy, to ignore his reporting,\" the inspector general's report says. \"The FBI regularly receives information from individuals with potentially significant biases and motivations, including drug traffickers, convicted felons, and even terrorists. The FBI is not required to set aside such information; rather, FBI policy requires that it critically assess the information. We found that after receiving Steele's reporting, the Crossfire Hurricane team began those efforts in earnest.\" The inspector general did not dispute that there was probable cause to monitor Page -- in other words, it did not find that the warrants were illegally obtained.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
