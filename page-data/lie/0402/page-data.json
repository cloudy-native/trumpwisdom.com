But he also said he supports strong border security. As PolitiFact found, this is not the same as \"allowing illegal immigration.\" On taxes, factcheck.org found that Ossoff has proposed to simplify the tax code, and that “in order to lower tax rates, we can eliminate carve-outs and special treatment in the tax code that privilege large organizations at the expense of small businesses.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"0396","repeated_count":"1","date":"04/18/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
