And more than twice what the entire building was worth, and the escalators or the elevators, I hear, cost -- they're the most expensive elevators in the history of the world, let's put it that way. They're the most expensive elevators. I heard the price. I said, 'That doesn't sound right.'”","analysis":"Richard Cordray, running for governor of Ohio, was the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB's building renovation actually cost $145 million, with the Office of Inspector General saying in 2015 that the construction costs “appeared reasonable.” Even in the Trump Tower, the elevators don't cost $50 million and we have no idea where he got this number. The most expensive elevator ever is the 1,070-foot-high Bailong Elevator, set in a Chinese mountain range. It cost $20 million.
