The special counsel continues to investigate potential illegal coordination between Russia and Trump's campaign, and no conclusions have been announced. It's false to say Democrats colluded with Russia during the election. Trump lays claim to the most successful first two years of any president, but the whirlwind of accomplishments under presidents such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama exceed Trump’s efforts. One right-leaning poll had Trump at 90 percent approval among Republicans, not 93. In any case, President George W. Bush had higher support among Republicans than 93 percent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
