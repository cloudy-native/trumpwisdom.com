As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY. We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!”","analysis":"There's no evidence that Democrats want to see the Second Amendment repealed. They regularly campaign for gun reform but that is different than repealing the amendment. Plus, Trump seems to be misunderstanding how the Supreme Court works. It isn't a political body that one party \"holds\" rather justices tend to have more liberal or conservative views, but they don't rule along party lines.
