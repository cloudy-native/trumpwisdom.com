And they're paying us billions of dollars. Okay? You never heard of that before. You've never heard of that in your whole life. We moved troops and we paid nothing. … Nobody ever asked. Obama didn't ask. Bush didn't ask. Clinton didn't ask. Nobody asked. In fact, they said to me, ‘But nobody has ever asked us to do this.’ I said, ‘I know, King, but I'm asking.’ And they're paying us -- they've already sent us billions of dollars. It's already in the bank. So -- and that's right.”","analysis":"Trump keeps claiming that the Saudi government is paying 100 percent of the cost of 3,000 troops, along with about four dozen Air Force fighters and Patriot anti missile batteries, being sent to the kingdom in response to attacks on Saudi oil facilities that U.S. officials blame on Iran. But no one in the administration will confirm this, and State Department and Defense Department officials say that they are negotiating \"burden-sharing\" with the Saudis. In the past, this has meant the Saudis agreed to pay for building barracks and other infrastructure for Prince Sultan Air Base, but not that they would reimburse the United States for the expense of troops. The Saudis have been slow in repaying $181 million owed for midair refueling assistance for its bombing runs over Yemen.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"15803, 14209, 13977, 14012, 15051","repeated_count":"5","date":"12/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
