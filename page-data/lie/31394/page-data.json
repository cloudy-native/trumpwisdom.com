The Trump administration has come up with several ideas to avoid releasing asylum seekers into the United States while they await immigration court hearings (what’s known as “catch and release”). But some of these pilot programs have been tied up in litigation, and authorities continue to release people into the country despite the president’s claim and numerous announcements that the program has ended. Since March, 2020, the majority of people apprehended at the Mexico border have been immediately expelled under an order the administration said aimed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But that's not the same thing as ending the official policy, which Trump had claimed he had done months earlier.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31488, 31394, 29852, 29035, 27995, 27631, 28232, 27000, 26834, 26347, 26209, 26326, 25567, 25355, 24684, 24433, 24007, 23848, 23481, 23059, 22012, 22377, 20990, 21106, 20394, 18022, 17820, 17596, 17783, 17037, 18409, 17529, 18361, 17409, 18297","repeated_count":"35","date":"01/06/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
