Mexican immigration officials had 886,640 encounters with Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans from 2011 through February, according to data from Mexico’s Department of the Interior (SEGOB). Fifty-three percent (472,249) happened at the four Mexican states that border Central America: Campeche, Chiapas, Quintana Roo and Tabasco. The statistics also show that from 2001 through February, Mexico recorded 2.15 million deportations of people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, the three countries in the Northern Triangle driving the Central American migration phenomenon.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"13539, 11205, 10955, 10880, 9909, 9893, 9728, 9757, 9763, 9777, 9810, 9817, 9725","repeated_count":"13","date":"04/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
