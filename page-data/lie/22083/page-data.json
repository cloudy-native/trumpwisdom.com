We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation.”","analysis":"Trump is talking about raw numbers, which is misleading. (And if you believe China, Beijing actually exceeds the number of tests, 90 million to 79 million for the United States.) The key indicator is tests per capita, which gives a read on the share of the population that has contracted the novel coronavirus that causes the disease covid-19. The United States still lags major countries such as Russia and is tied with Britain in terms of number of tests per million people.\n\nAnother problem is test results are slow in the United States. “Test results for the novel coronavirus are taking so long to come back that experts say the results across the United States are often proving useless in the campaign to control the deadly disease,” The Washington Post reported in July. “ ... The long testing turnaround times are making it impossible for the United States to replicate the central strategy used by other countries to effectively contain the virus — test, trace and isolate.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28955, 29134, 27918, 27023, 26764, 25986, 23963, 23758, 23562, 22083, 23003, 22952, 22968, 21900, 22248, 22881, 21844, 22790, 21258, 21291, 22739, 21717, 22643, 21692, 20907, 20923, 21484, 21109, 21146, 21156, 20875, 20844, 20722, 20379, 20078, 19889, 20347, 18682, 19376, 18873, 19098, 19402, 19419, 19325, 18800, 19562, 19585, 18746, 18939, 19272, 18705, 18715, 18693, 18696, 19541, 19233, 19479, 19470, 19213, 19460, 19201, 18618, 19129, 19143, 19175, 19437, 19094, 19122, 18587, 18085, 17732, 18557, 18583, 18541, 18542, 18543, 18527, 17922, 17933, 17872, 16800","repeated_count":"81","date":"08/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
