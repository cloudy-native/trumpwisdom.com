Underwood of New York charged that the now-defunct Donald J. Trump Foundation had violated a federal law known as the Johnson Amendment, which bars charities from supporting candidates for office. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign “extensively directed and coordinated the Foundation’s activities in connection with a nationally televised charity fundraiser for the Foundation in Des Moines, Iowa on January 28, 2016,” Underwood charged. The fundraiser was billed as an effort to “raise funds for veterans’ organizations,” but the Trump campaign commandeered nearly $2.8 million in donations and “dictated the manner in which the Foundation would disburse those proceeds, directing the timing, amounts and recipients of the grants.” The foundation was also found to have broken other rules. The president settled the lawsuit and notes correctly that all the funds eventually went to other charities.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
