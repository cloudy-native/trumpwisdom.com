In several key states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, absentee ballots were reported later because state rules would not allow pre-canvassing of absentee or mail-in ballots before Election Day. So that accounted for many votes that were counted late in the night and the next day. Trump sometimes posts charts of \"dumps,\" but often this surge in votes appears to have been nothing more than vote results from a big urban county, such as Milwaukee County, the most populous in the state, being formally registered. Polls closed in Wisconsin at 8 p.m., and Milwaukee County began <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/19/an-unusually-easy-trump-debunking-there-was-no-suspicious-vote-dump-wisconsin/\">tallying its results</a>. In other words, if that “dump” of ballots hadn’t occurred, there would have been almost no votes tallied in Milwaukee County at all.
