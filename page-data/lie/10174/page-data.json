It was done and then John McCain at the very last moment late in the evening went thumbs down and everybody said, what was that? John McCain went thumbs down. He did the Republican Party a tremendous disservice and did the nation a tremendous disservice. Tremendous. And it's unfortunate but we had it done. And had we known he was going to -- because he said he was voting for it all day long. Had we known he was going to vote against it, I think we could have convinced one of the other two people that voted against it. We could have convinced them. I feel confident to go for it. But we didn't even try because we knew we had John McCain and we had everybody, and we're all set. And he went thumbs down at the very last moment.”","analysis":"Trump suggests that Sen. John McCain's vote was the only impediment to passing a repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. But none of the substantive replacement bills got nearly enough votes, and McCain's vote was against a \"skinny\" repeal that was only to lead to talks with the House on a common position, with no guarantee of an agreement that would pass both Houses. McCain had earlier voted for a version of repealing the ACA, but he objected to the skinny repeal because the process went against legislative tradition.
