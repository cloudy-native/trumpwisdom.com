This will be the first Impeachment ever where there was no crime. They don't even allege a crime. Crazy!”","analysis":"Polls show support for Trump's impeachment is higher than opposition to impeachment, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/impeachment-polls/\">according to 538</a>. A statutory crime is not required to impeach. But the House Judiciary Committee’s report on Trump and Ukraine says that the first article of impeachment includes “impeachable ‘bribery’ and violations of federal criminal law.\" The House intelligence committee’s report says Trump “personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection.” (Requesting foreign assistance in U.S. elections is a crime.) Many outside experts say that Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was highly unusual. Trump appeared to have no agenda except to ask for the Ukrainian government to work with his private attorney to investigate a potential 2020 presidential rival and also investigate debunked conspiracy theories about possible interference by Ukraine in the 2016 election. Trump made about eight requests for help with some sort of investigation involving either former vice president Joe Biden or the Democrats. Just before the call took place, Trump with no explanation halted the expected delivery of military aid. Some U.S. diplomats believed the halt was connected to the president's demands for a probe of Biden, text messages released by Congress show. Moreover, The Washington Post reported that at least four national security officials were so alarmed by Trump’s ongoing pressure campaign on Ukraine that they lodged objections with a White House lawyer before and right after the call.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
