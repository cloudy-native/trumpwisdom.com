It was Axios's decision to publish poll findings given to them anonymously from a Democratic group. The poll surveyed only white voters with less than two years of college education, according to Axios, so it was not representative of all the voters in Omar's district. According to Axios, she was polling at 9 percent among white, non-college-educated voters, not 8 percent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
