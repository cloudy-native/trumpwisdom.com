And they know we need it. Most of them voted for it in 2006. I don't know if you know that. Most of them.

But the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself has called the 2006 fence a \"nothing wall.\" It passed 283-138 in the House, with 64 Democrat votes, and 80-19 in the Senate, with 26 Democrat votes.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
