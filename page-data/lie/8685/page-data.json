You look at what happened the first months coming into my term they were very low, the numbers, the GDP and everything else. If I would have stayed with those numbers Laura, we would have had an economy that would have been going way in reverse right now.”","analysis":"The start of Trump’s economy follows the trend set by the last years of Obama’s economy. There's no evidence to suggest that \"the U.S. would be in a Depression\" had Trump not been elected.  The historical books are going to view the actions taken in 2008 and 2009 by George W. Bush and Obama — and the Federal Reserve — as pivotal to saving the U.S. economy. Trump has exceeded expectations on jobs and economic growth that were in place at the start of 2017. That’s due in part because of his tax cut, but also because of factors largely beyond his control, such as the increase in oil prices. The real test will be whether the current trajectory is sustainable.
