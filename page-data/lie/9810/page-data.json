They've been taking people under their very powerful laws -- they have the right to do it -- and they're bringing them back to where they came from. That's about three days now, I guess, since -- frankly, since they heard I was going to close the border.”","analysis":"This is false. Trump threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border, then he backed off and claimed Mexico had responded to his threat by beginning to detain Central American migrants at its southern border. But Mexico has been detaining and deporting Central American migrants at its border for decades. Mexican government statistics show that the country has deported people from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador -- the three countries driving the migration phenomenon -- more than 2 million times since 2001.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"13539, 11205, 10955, 10880, 9909, 9893, 9728, 9757, 9763, 9777, 9810, 9817, 9725","repeated_count":"13","date":"04/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
