Taking your jobs from North Carolina and every other place, and moving em out of the country and we turned it around, you gotta remember that. These corrupt forces, they don't see our nation as a protector of its citizens but as a vehicle for personal profit and power at your expense....They build walls for themselves while forcing your family to suffer the consequences of illegal immigration, drugs, and crime. And you know it very well over here. For five decades Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders, and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars.”","analysis":"This is ridiculous over-the-top rhetoric, a smear on hyperdrive.
