Already during my time in office we have reduced the total amount of opioid prescribed by 34 percent. That’s a pretty amazing number.”","analysis":"Trump overstates what has taken place and moved the goal posts on his pledge. A Health and Human Services Department <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2019/04/24/hhs-fact-sheet-combating-the-opioid-crisis.html\">news release</a> indicated the statistic is preliminary and is derived from a monthly figure. \"From the President’s inauguration in January 2017 through February 2019, initial market data suggests that the total amount of opioids being prescribed monthly has dropped by 34 percent. While we need more data to confirm this snapshot, it shows we may have succeeded in meeting this goal [of a one-third drop] already,\" HHS said. An HHS spokesman confirmed the agency was using two monthly data points. February appears to experience big drops — it’s the shortest month of the year — and that happens to be the end point. A three-month rolling average shows a decline, though not as stark as 34 percent. But opioid prescriptions have been declining for years, having reached a peak in 2010 or 2012, depending on what data set you use. The declines especially began to accelerate after the CDC in March 2016 issued new guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain — 10 months before Trump took the oath of office. Moreover, Trump made his pledge in March 2018, indicating a three-year goal, and backdating to the start of Trump’s presidency seems to be moving the goal posts, as the decline in opioid prescriptions on a monthly scale since Trump’s speech is about 20 percent, not 34 percent.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/24/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
