I call it 'invasion.' They always get upset when I say 'an invasion.' But it really is somewhat of an invasion.”","analysis":"There is no \"invasion\" of the country along the southern border. Apprehensions of people trying to cross the southern border peaked most recently at 1.6 million in 2000 and have been in decline since, falling to just under 400,000 in fiscal 2018. The decline is partly because of technology upgrades; tougher penalties in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks; a decline in migration rates from Mexico; and a sharp increase in the number of Border Patrol officers. The fiscal 2018 number was up from just over 300,000 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border for fiscal 2017, the lowest level in more than 45 years, though the months of January and February 2019 saw sharp increases. There are far more cases of travelers overstaying their visas than southern border apprehensions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
