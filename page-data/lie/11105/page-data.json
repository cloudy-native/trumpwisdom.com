NO, in fact he didn't even tell the Senate Intelligence Committee of which he is a member. When @RepAdamSchiff took calls from another person, also very successfully purporting to be a Russian Operative, did he call the FBI, or even think to call the FBI? NO!”","analysis":"Trump appears to have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/13/politics/fact-check-trump-fbi-schiff-warner/index.html\">switched the two episodes</a> he is referring to with Warner and Schiff. But in any case, both lawmakers says they immediately informed the FBI. In 2017, Schiff spoke to someone by phone purporting to be a Ukrainian government official claiming to have proof the Russians had compromising information, \"kompromat,\" on Trump. The call actually turned out to be two Russian comedians, and the pranksters leaked audio of the phone call with Schiff. In the audio, Schiff tells the caller he's going to speak to the FBI and encourages the official to do the same. As for Warner, Trump is likely referring to his lengthy text message exchange in 2017 with Adam Waldman, a lobbyist who was connected to both Christopher Steele, author of the infamous dossier, and Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. But when Waldman initially reached out over text message, Warner says the called the FBI about the communication. Contrary to Trump's tweet, Warner also informed the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/13/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
