Last year, I raised $44 billion more by saying, I'm sorry, you have to step up. The year before that, my first year -- so, I was just getting started -- I raised $24 billion with one meeting. And until that, it was just going down. It was going down. For 15 years it was just going down, the numbers going into NATO.”","analysis":"Trump did not raise $44 billion more for NATO. Before Trump even announced he was running for president, the alliance in 2014 agreed to have each member state meet a guideline of spending at least two percent of their gross domestic product on defense spending, with the goal of achieving that by 2024. The defense-spending numbers were going up before Trump won the presidency. None of of this additional spending is contributed directly to NATO.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
