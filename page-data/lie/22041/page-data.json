In other words, how about you, you're likely to vote. But how about you, you're registered, but I'm not voting. But see, under their plan where they send these ballots, you don't have to want to vote. You get the ballot and then they have harvesting. They get guys to go, 'Do you want to vote?' 'No, not really, but I have a ballot.' 'All right, good. Who's it for?' 'Sleepy Joe Biden.' 'Now put it here, sign. Okay. Could I have it?' And they'll take it. In fact, harvesting is illegal in your state. They wanted to put a Republican, a fine man, a pastor, they wanted to put them in jail because he harvested. Now they want to make harvesting legal all of a sudden. They'll put him in jail as a Republican, right? If he was a Democrat, they wouldn't even be thinking about it.”","analysis":"Trump spins another election-fraud fantasy here. Democrats in 2018 won seven seats in Orange County, California, receiving a boost from votes tabulated after election day, predominantly from absentee and provisional ballots. California always takes a long time to count its mail-in ballots, and the results sometimes change the results in elections that were close on election night. California allows non-family members to submit other people's vote-by-mail ballots, what Trump calls \"harvesting.\" But there are careful checks in place to prevent fraud, such as verifying that the signature on a ballot matches that of the registered voter. There is no evidence any fraud was committed in those elections. Republicans in California have admitted they had not taken advantage of \"harvesting\" as much as Democrats in the state and are stepping up efforts to close the gap. The case in North Carolina, involving a Republican, was a case of alleged fraud -- improperly collected and possibly tampered with ballots -- that the race needed to be rerun.
