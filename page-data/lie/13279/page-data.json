Not taken away from President Trump; taken away from President Obama. President Obama was not happy that this happened because it was embarrassing to him.”","analysis":"Trump presents a warped history, blaming President Obama for Russia's hostilities in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. In fact, it was Russian aggression, and in response Obama rallied the international community to impose sanctions on Russia, and NATO countries began spending more on their defense. Trump would like to reward Russia by inviting it back to the G-7.
