The number for factory closures is accurate, but to suggest China was the only factor is misleading. Economists say automation and other forces also played a role. The number for job losses is seriously exaggerated. Official government data show 4.3 million to 4.7 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost after China joined the WTO -- but, again, although China had a big role, it's misleading to blame it all on them. And he certainly cannot use this number when referring to NAFTA.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/29/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
