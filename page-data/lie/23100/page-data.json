They didn't even discuss law enforcement, the police. Those words weren't mentioned.”","analysis":"Trump is wrong that the police were not mentioned or featured at all. On the first night of the convention, Biden hosted a conversation about policing. The chief of police for Houston, Art Acevedo, spoke of creating standards for the police, which he said “is what everyone wants, including all the good cops that are out there, that thankfully there are more of them than there are bad cops.” On the third night, the convention aired a video that highlighted Biden's role in writing the Violence Against Women Act.
