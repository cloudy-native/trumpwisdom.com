Unemployment has been steadily declining since its peak in 2010. Moreover, Trump now uses data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate to say this, which is a flip-flop from his previous claims dismissing the BLS unemployment rate as \"nonsense.\" Trump has touted 2.6% growth in the quarter, but that is much lower than his promise of 4% growth.
