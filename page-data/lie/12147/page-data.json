This large scale false reporting is sick!”","analysis":"When Trump doesn't like what's being reported, he calls it fake news. But in almost every case, the reports are proven to be accurate and the substance of Trump's complaint is that the facts reflect poorly on him. Reputable news organizations follow ethical rules and correct mistakes promptly, something Trump knows since he often celebrates these corrections on Twitter. These overheated comments are not based in facts.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/22/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
