This, they fight. That's what they do, they kill each other. So many years. So we're doing one deal, another deal, and they come in to tell me they're doing a deal with Kosovo, a deal with Serbia... That [deal] took me about 15 minutes. We made a deal and the leaders came into the Oval Office and they were hugging, and kissing, and they were so happy...We saved a lot of lives. And, you know what? It cost us nothing. It didn't do anything. We're saving a lot of good people.”","analysis":"Trump falsely-- and bizarrely -- takes credit for ending a war between Serbia and Kosovo that ended more than two decades ago. Despite continued tensions, the two sides have not directly fought each other since 1999. Trump helped negotiate an economic normalization deal between Kosovo and Serbia, but that agreement mostly involved economic and transportation links, and it did not solve tougher geopolitical issues like Serbia’s refusal to recognize Kosovo ever since the country declared its independence in 2008.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30386, 30272, 29720, 30033, 28579, 28391, 27963, 28257","repeated_count":"8","date":"10/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
