They did not want to meet with the person in question. But we had a very good meeting. They're very nice people. And we met with the full group. It was four people, actually, as you -- you know how it's all broken up.

Trump apparently had hoped for a made-for-television moment. The White House \"heaped grief and pain on the family by making them go through this but not allowing them to get the closure they need by talking to Mrs Sacoolas before they can go onto the grieving stage,\" their lawyer said. Sacoolas, the wife of a U.S. diplomat, left Britain under a disputed claim of diplomatic immunity.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
