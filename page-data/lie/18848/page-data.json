You gave in to this pressure the next day and told the world that the coronavirus did not pose a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Just over one week later, on January 30, 2020, overwhelming evidence to the contrary forced you to reverse course.”","analysis":"Note the use of the word “reportedly.” Trump appears to be citing a German news report that was based on a German intelligence finding. The WHO has denied the report as “unfounded and untrue,” noting: “Dr. Tedros and President Xi did not speak on 21 January and they have never spoken by telephone.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
