Those troops are still being assessed for concussion symptoms following the blast, Navy Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/01/17/americans-injured-iran-missile-attack/\">said in a statement on Jan. 16</a>. Eight U.S. troops were evacuated to a U.S. base in Germany, he said, and the other three were sent to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait. At least two soldiers were thrown through the window of a meters-high tower. The Pentagon <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/u-s-military-raises-injury-toll-in-iran-missile-attack-in-iraq/30448623.html\">eventually admitted</a> that 110 U.S. service members were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries; the eight soldiers who had been treated in Germany were sent to the U.S. for treatment. Trump has dismissed the injuries as \"headaches\" but they are very serious.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"16770, 16569, 16565, 16566, 16567, 16568","repeated_count":"6","date":"01/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
