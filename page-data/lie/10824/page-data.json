Experts say the president is wrong to claim that service members are “not allowed to take any drugs” or that they can't take the specific drugs used for gender reassignment. Hormones are permissible for service members, as are opioids and psychotropic drugs. Moreover, not all transgender people undergo gender reassignment surgery or take prescription hormones, so even if Trump were correct that such prescribed drugs were prohibited, it wouldn't necessarily mean transgender troops would have to be banned from serving. The Defense Department itself later contradicted Trump’s claim that service-members are “not allowed to take any drugs\" and that transgender troops can’t serve because of this. “The Military Health System covers all approved medically necessary treatments and prescription medications,” DOD spokeswoman Jessica Maxwell said. “If a service member has a hormone deficiency for any reason (such as hypogonadism, hypothyroidism, menopause, etc.), he or she would be prescribed hormones.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
