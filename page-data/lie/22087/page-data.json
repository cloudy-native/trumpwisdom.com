But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year, the first time in over 20 years that they upped their payments. And this $130 billion will ultimately go to $400 billion.","analysis":"Throughout the 2016 campaign and his presidency, Trump has demonstrated that he has little notion of how NATO is funded and operates. He repeatedly claimed that other members of the alliance “owed” money to the United States and that they were delinquent in their payments. Then he claimed credit for the money “pouring in” as a result of his jawboning, even though much of the increase in those countries’ contributions had been set under guidelines arranged during the Obama administration.\n\nSince 2006, NATO guidelines have asked each member country to spend at least 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense. In 2014, NATO decided to increase its spending in response to Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region, with the goal of reaching 2 percent in each country by 2024. This money does not end up in NATO’s coffers, as Trump often asserts. (Direct funding, for military-related operations, maintenance and headquarters activity, is based on gross national income — the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country — and is adjusted regularly.)\n\nTrump’s $130 billion figure comes from a NATO estimate that its European members and Canada will spend $130 billion additionally on defense over the four years between 2016 and 2020. (The $130 billion is an estimate for cumulative defense spending through 2020, in 2015 dollars, as an increase over 2016 spending.) Trump falsely claims this is $130 billion a year, rather than over four years.\n\nThe $400 billion figure is for eight years.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"31587, 29679, 27787, 25395, 24756, 24637, 23788, 23404, 23079, 22087, 22307, 21125, 20811, 20120, 18781, 17719, 17335, 16897, 16644, 16172, 16071, 15010, 14587, 14599, 14670, 15778, 15781, 15787, 15810, 14000, 13618, 13510, 11564, 11411, 11459, 11247, 12249, 10911, 10553, 10557, 10896, 10251, 8359, 8028, 7920, 7928, 7313, 7218, 7488, 7207, 7205, 6226, 6179, 6191, 6406, 6118, 5962, 6098, 6317, 6318, 5361, 5368, 4803, 4821, 4881, 4755, 4767, 4594, 4370, 4586, 4588, 4747, 4748, 4296, 3896, 3733, 3884, 3761, 4188, 4199, 3793, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3626, 3638, 3639, 3779, 4210, 4214, 4215, 3641, 3748, 3751, 3419, 3591, 3646, 3649, 3738, 3740, 3319, 4117, 4118, 4122, 4123, 3600, 3574, 3990, 3402, 3348, 2951, 2785, 2812, 2825, 2839, 2659, 1903, 1873, 1645, 0759, 0761, 0638, 0616, 0598, 0600, 0591, 0592, 0593, 0594, 0524, 0474, 0486, 0422, 0300, 0267, 0256, 0188","repeated_count":"137","date":"08/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
