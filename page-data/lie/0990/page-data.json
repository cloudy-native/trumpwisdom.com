As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country. You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”","analysis":"In general, legal permanent residents already can't \"come in immediately and start picking up welfare.\" The five-year ban that Trump suggests already exists, and new immigrants are not eligible for the major federal public assistance programs during those years. There are some exceptions, such as refugees and asylees, or people with military connections.
