We gave 1.4 million documents. We gave hundreds of people. I let him interview the lawyer -- the White House lawyer -- for 30 hours. Think of that: thirty hours. I let him interview other people. I didn't have to let him interview anybody. I didn't have to give any documents. I was totally transparent because I knew I did nothing wrong.”","analysis":"Special counsel Robert Mueller's report lays out evidence of several potential obstruction-of-justice offenses by the president, including attempts by Trump to remove Mueller and curtail the investigation, and actions that Mueller said could influence witness testimony. Trump declined interview requests and his written answers to questions were called insufficient in Mueller's report.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
