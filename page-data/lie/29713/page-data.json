Biden shut it down.”","analysis":"Trump did provide funding for the Philadelphia Shipyard but it's false that Biden shut it down. Biden, as a senator from Delaware, was long a supporter of the Philadelphia Shipyard amd played a key role in extending its health, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://frumpblog.com/2020/03/15/joe-bidens-early-years/\">according to a former reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>: \"President Reagan had vowed to create a 600-ship Navy – a huge expansion.  In that proposal was $800 million to refit such carriers as the SS Saratoga. The Service Life Extension Program as it was called would no doubt go the way of most shipyard work: It would go to a yard in the South. This was so because of an iron alliance.  The southern shipyard states looked after each other. Alabama would get a contract one year, Virginia the next. Then Louisiana.  The combined Senate votes could not be overcome in the North where no such alliance occurred. Biden put one together. The Philadelphia Naval Shipyard employed 10,000 people in Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  These weren't burger flipping jobs. They were real blue collar middle class jobs that paid for houses, college educations, maybe even a boat or a vacation at the shore....Biden’s people were able to bring the tri state delegation together. And then they were able to strike bargains with neutral states that put the Philadelphia shipyard over the top.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
