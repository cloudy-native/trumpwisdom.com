Woodward was a mistake. ... I didn't speak to him and that was a mistake not speaking to him.”","analysis":"Trump is speaking about \"Fear,\" a book by Bob Woodward that portrays the Trump presidency as coming off the rails. Woodward relied on sources who in many cases were not identified, as is his long-standing practice. Woodward says he has hundreds of hours of taped interviews with sources who have direct knowledge of the events described in the book. Reporting by major media outlets about the inner workings of the Trump administration in many cases corroborates Woodward's reporting in \"Fear.\" An associate editor of The Post renowned for his Watergate reporting, Woodward has written about the inner workings of both Democratic and Republican administrations since the 1970s. Trump says the book would have been different had he responded to Woodward's interview requests, but the scenes and facts in the book have not been challenged.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"23887, 8539, 4896, 5022, 4780, 4813, 4984, 4985, 5015, 4934, 4937, 4958, 4959, 4960, 4963, 4964, 4749, 4751, 4752","repeated_count":"19","date":"01/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
