According to a comprehensive 2016 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine on the economic impacts of the U.S. immigration system, studies on the impact of immigration showed “the seemingly paradoxical result that although larger immigration flows may generate higher rates of unemployment in some sectors, overall, the rate of unemployment for native workers declines.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
