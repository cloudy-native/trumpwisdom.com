I think you'd do that. I think I'd even do it. 10 million?...Another email reference, 10% held by Hunter for the big guy. I wouldn't know who the big guy was, the big guy. He doesn't look so big to me. He doesn't look so big when he walks on the stage. He's not looking at strong. Fragile, very fragile, but the big guy, they call him the big guy. One document shows a plan to take money from Chinese state-owned enterprises. This -- I tell you what, this laptop is a disaster. How the hell did he ever let go of this sucker. He put it too well, he got to have it fixed. I guess he forgot to pick it up, what the hell?”","analysis":"In the final weeks of the campaign, Trump seized on a report in the New York Post to make wild claims of corruption against Joe Biden. But it was rather murky and unconfirmed. The article was based on emails <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/14/hunter-bidens-alleged-laptop-an-explainer/\">purportedly obtained from a laptop</a> that Hunter Biden, the son of former vice president Joe Biden, had supposedly left behind for repair in a Delaware shop in April 2019. The key thrust of the article is that an April 17, 2015, email suggests Hunter Biden arranged for a top executive at a Ukrainian energy firm to meet with the then-vice president when he was in charge of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. The former vice president has said he did not discuss Burisma with his son. The email is not specific about the nature of the meeting and is written in a way that it could be talking about a possible future meeting. There also is no indication that Hunter Biden replied to the email -- or that the email is authentic. Another email published by the New York Post contradicts the notion that Hunter Biden could influence his father. “What he will do and say is out of our hands,” Hunter Biden wrote in an email that the New York Post said was sent April 13, 2014. Andrew Bates, a campaign spokesman for Joe Biden, said a review of Biden’s schedules from 2015 finds no record of any such meeting. Subsequent New York Post reports claimed an email showed Hunter Biden was negotiating a consulting arrangement worth $10 million that included \"introductions.\" The FBI obtained the laptop but a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/us/politics/hunter-biden-justice-department-pittsburgh.html\">New York Times report</a> after the election said that investigators, exploring a possible money laundering case against Hunter Biden, \"had already examined a laptop owned by Mr. Biden and an external hard drive that had been abandoned at a computer store in Wilmington and found nothing to advance the inquiry.\" A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hunter-bidens-family-name-aided-deals-with-foreign-tycoons-11608682462\">lengthy Wall Street Journal examination</a> of Hunter Biden's business dealings, published Dec. 22, 2020, concluded: \"None of the Journal’s reporting found that Joe Biden was involved in his son’s business activities. The tax investigation doesn’t implicate the president-elect, according to people familiar with the matter.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"29803, 29897, 30169, 30215, 30511, 29207, 29344, 29607, 29530, 28923, 29120, 28622, 28525, 28976, 28064, 28158, 27968, 27704, 27644, 28200, 27004, 26743, 26813, 26641, 26687, 26896, 27089, 27266, 27422, 26887, 26986, 27493, 26333, 26336, 26411, 26170, 26171, 26073","repeated_count":"38","date":"10/21/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
