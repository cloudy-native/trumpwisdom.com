It's true. They wipe them out.”","analysis":"The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/protect/laws.html\">federal penalty</a> for killing a bald eagle (first offense) is a maximum of one year in jail. California has laws prohibiting the \"taking\" or \"possession\" of bald eagles. Windmills do kill bald eagles but there is no evidence they will \"wipe them all out.\" The Obama administration [approved a rule</a> that lets wind-energy companies operate high-speed turbines for up to 30 years but not face a penalty if they kill or injure up to 4,200 bald eagles, an increase of almost four times the previous limit. When the rule was adopted in 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service estimated there were about 143,000 bald eagles in the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
