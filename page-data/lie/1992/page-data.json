Sulzberger. Congratulations! Here is a last chance for the Times to fulfill the vision of its Founder, Adolph Ochs, “to give the news impartially, without fear or FAVOR, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved.” Get impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent “sources,” and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!”","analysis":"The New York Times did not apologize to its readers about the 2016 election, although Trump frequently makes this claim. Obviously, mainstream news organizations such as the Times or The Washington Post make mistakes, but they do not rely on “nonexistent” sources. That would be a firing offense, as has been proved time and again.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30129, 30525, 27637, 27310, 25967, 24707, 14192, 13343, 12475, 9752, 9919, 8272, 5074, 5150, 4889, 4949, 4950, 4629, 4474, 3642, 4212, 4183, 4142, 3103, 1992, 1727, 1289, 1238, 1065, 0978, 0747, 0746, 0743, 0335, 0163, 0106, 0077, 0050, 0035","repeated_count":"39","date":"01/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
