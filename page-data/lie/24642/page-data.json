You know that. You lost 43%, but I think the real number's 61%, by the way.”","analysis":"These numbers seem rather precise to be believable. Trump often says one in three manufacturing jobs was lost to NAFTA and China's entry into the World Trade Organization. Trump often blames these trade deals for the decline in American manufacturing, but experts say it's hard to isolate their effect on jobs. Meanwhile, technological advances such as automation and low wages in manufacturing powerhouses such as China also played a role in declining manufacturing in the U.S., though Trump rarely if ever acknowledges these factors.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29788, 29877, 29964, 30153, 30204, 30505, 29336, 29597, 29502, 29675, 30010, 28914, 29097, 29170, 28748, 28038, 28114, 28285, 27937, 27890, 24849, 24675, 24642, 14064","repeated_count":"24","date":"09/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
