The current fiscal year began only a few months ago. The Washington Post reported that similar comments from Trump within days of this rally “grossly overstate spending decisions and mask an aging fleet of planes” and that “the actual amount spent on military equipment since he became president is much less, closer to $420 billion, according to Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The rest was spent on things like personnel, operations and maintenance, and research and development.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
