That was a great success. Hey, they've been working on this for so many years, and they got nothing. I just got -- I just left, what, three months ago or less? I left Singapore. You had no missiles shot, you have no rockets shot, you have no nuclear testing, and we got back our hostages. And I have a good relationship with him. You know, we have a good chemistry together.”","analysis":"Trump is unusually ungracious to his predecessors, especially considering he has only just embarked on negotiations. Bill Clinton negotiated a nuclear agreement with North Korea that froze its plutonium program and was working on a missile deal when he departed office. But that agreement fell apart under George W. Bush. But then Bush tried to negotiate a deal, even lifting sanctions on North Korea. But that deal fell apart once Obama was elected. In each case, North Korea used the arrival of a new president to wiggle out of its commitments.
