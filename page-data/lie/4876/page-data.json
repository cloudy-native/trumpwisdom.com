She could claim about half of them in November, 2015, about three months before the first primary votes. But she would have won the nomination even sooner if superdelegates had not existed, as she won substantially more delegates in the primary and caucus votes.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
