Bill, he wasn't mocking me. He was trying to get them to believe I said what he made up and it was horrible. That's why I released the transcript.”","analysis":"Trump is trying to suggest he played gotcha on the Democrats but this is totally mixed up. The rough transcript — which the White House acknowledged was not verbatim — was released on Sept. 25 and Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) held the hearing on Sept. 26. Republicans at the hearing were able to call out Schiff’s embellishments precisely because they had the recorded words in front of them. But Trump reverses the order in his telling. (There is no exact transcript of the conversation — in which Trump urged an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 election rival — as the summary was cobbled together from notes by White House officials. So Schiff told the audience that “this is the essence of what the president communicates” and that he would describe “in sum and character, what the president was trying to communicate.” That was a signal to listeners that he was not quoting verbatim from the rough transcription. But Schiff did exaggerate at points, such as when he suggested that Trump, after asking for “a favor,” said something along the lines of: “I'm going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent.” Biden’s name came up twice in the call, not seven times.)","pinocchios":"4","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"28927, 26799, 23037, 20415, 18341, 18212, 16764, 16793, 16634, 16409, 16663, 16116, 15983, 15950, 16228, 16230, 15399, 14766, 15734, 14545, 15297, 15587, 14982, 14255, 15170, 14361, 14107, 14602, 13742, 15117, 13738, 13740, 13741","repeated_count":"33","date":"11/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
