They’ve been giving everything. When you look at what Bill Clinton did — and you’ve seen the famous clip where Bill Clinton wants to give [the North Koreans] everything, and where I said, years ago, with Russert on Meet the Press — many years ago, I talked to — I don’t think anything has changed. ”","analysis":"Trump oversimplifies the efforts by previous presidents to halt North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Clinton considered an attack but ended up with a diplomatic solution that ultimately unraveled. George W. Bush also punished North Korea as a way to nudge Pyongyang back to the bargaining table. In 1999, Trump had told Tim Russert he would negotiate vigorously before considering an attack.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"9159, 9004, 8710, 8352, 8294, 6297, 5328, 5531, 5720, 5157, 4592, 4367, 4302, 4033, 3971, 3924, 16809, 3367, 3305, 3298, 3301, 2949, 2905, 2805, 2632, 2802, 2550, 2489, 2491, 2301, 2075, 2111, 1984, 1955, 1893, 1333, 1317, 1317, 1286, 1286, 1268, 0996, 0580, 0495","repeated_count":"44","date":"01/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
