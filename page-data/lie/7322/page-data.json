This index includes nearly 98 percent of U.S. stocks, but the market capitalization of the top U.S. companies is not necessarily an indicator of wealth gains for the general population. Plus, China's economy is still growing, just not at the rapid pace that it has enjoyed in recent years. (China's economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter of 2018, according to official data.) Trump appears to be referring to the decline in the value of China's stock market, though it did not actually fall 32 percent. A stock market is not necessarily emblematic of a nation's economy, as Trump would likely argue now that U.S. stocks were badly rattled in the last weeks of 2018.
