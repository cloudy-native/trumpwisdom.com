Quantitative tightening was a killer, should have done the exact opposite!”","analysis":"The president has no basis to make these claims about the impact of Federal Reserve policy. The Fed raised rates in part in response to the stimulus caused by the president's tax cut to avoid having an overheating economy, but it also had to maneuver around the difficult-to-predict impact of the president's trade wars. The Fed is an independent agency, and generally presidents are not so critical of Fed actions, even if they disagree with them.
