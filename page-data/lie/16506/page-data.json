The Trump administration at first claimed that the legal justification for Soleimani's killing was an \"imminent\" attack Soleimani was supposedly planning. But the administration has been unable to support that justification with evidence. Trump veers further into specious territory when he claims Soleimani killed \"thousands\" of Americans. As <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2020/jan/15/iran-iraq-soleimani-deadly-fight-against/\">PolitiFact</a> reported: \"The last Pentagon estimate of U.S. deaths by Iranian-backed militias was 603, not thousands as Trump said. And Iran’s role in Afghanistan was 'ambiguous,' in the words of Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top commander in Afghanistan in 2009. Iranian weapons did make their way to the Taliban, while at the same time, the Iranian government put much more effort into supporting the Afghan government.
