I have a feeling he's leaving office, not because he had to -- he was leading everybody in the polls in that great state where we just had a tremendous victory, in Mississippi -- but he was leading by a lot. I'd say, 'Phil, why don't you run again?' 'No, I think we're going to take it a little easy.' See? He has a lot of confidence in himself. Non-confident people would say, 'I got to run. I got to run.' But, Phil, you've done a fantastic job and we appreciate it.”","analysis":"This anecdote appears to be a fabrication. Bryant served two terms as Mississippi governor and did not have the option to run again because of term limits.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
