Intelligence analysts believe that the bounties probably resulted in the deaths of three Marines killed in April 2019 when the vehicle they were traveling in was blown up just outside Bagram, the main U.S. air base in Afghanistan, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/democrats-assail-administration-officials-for-not-forcing-trump-to-address-russian-operation-targeting-us-troops/2020/06/30/4744f408-badf-11ea-80b9-40ece9a701dc_story.html\">The Washington Post reported</a>. The intelligence reports were contained in the presidential daily brief, which Trump is said not to read carefully, but apparently Trump's briefer did not bring the subject to his attention.
