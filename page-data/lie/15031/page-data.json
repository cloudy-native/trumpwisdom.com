A lot of people were against it. They said, isn't that terrible. Countries that have crime rates that are so high, you wouldn't even believe it’s possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries, I’m sorry.”","analysis":"Trump has offered no evidence to back up his claim but his statement is problematic in the wake of the deadly shooting rampage at a Navy flight school in Pensacola, Fla., by a Saudi military student, Ahmed Mohammed al-Shamrani, in December of 2019. Trump’s travel ban covers these countries: Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. (Chad was originally on the list but was removed in 2018 after the White House said the country improved security measures; Iraq and Sudan had been on earlier versions but not the one that passed muster with the Supreme Court.) So that means Saudi Arabia would not be covered. The travel ban essentially halted the issuance of immigrant visas to the affected countries and restricted certain types of nonimmigrant visas, such as for tourism and business, though it varied from country to country.
