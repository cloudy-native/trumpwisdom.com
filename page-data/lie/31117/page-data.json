And it’s a very sad thing. They walked out complaining. But the number’s large. … You also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands, who went to the voting place on November 3, were told they couldn't vote, were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put on their name.

(Obviously, the problem can exist and appears to result from clerical errors. There is no evidence it occurs in great numbers, is intentional, or disadvantages one party more than then the other.)","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31117, 30817, 30795, 30762, 31413, 30716","repeated_count":"6","date":"01/02/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
