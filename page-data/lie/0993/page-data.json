I used to go around and talk about the veterans and they’d stand on line for nine days, seven days, four days … 15 days. People that could have been given a prescription and been better right away end up dying waiting on line. That’s not happening anymore.”","analysis":"The VA started publishing wait times at its medical centers, but the effort to do this started more than a year and half ago under the Obama administration, following the 2014 Phoenix VA scandal. Wait-time issues persist at the VA. During his May 31 \"State of the VA\" speech, VA Secretary David Shulkin said the VA is \"still in critical condition and require intensive care,\" and veterans are waiting more than 60 days for new appointments at about 30 of 168 VA medical centers.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"1207, 1003","repeated_count":"2","date":"07/25/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
