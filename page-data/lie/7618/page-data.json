He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law. It is called ‘advice of counsel,’ and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made. That is why they get paid. Despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly...... ....stated that I did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws, if they even apply, because this was not campaign finance.”","analysis":"This was an unusually lawyerly tweet by the president. But the plain fact is that Trump Attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to violating campaign finance laws at the direction of Trump when he made pay-offs to women that alleged they had affairs with Trump. The hush-money payments were violations of the law because campaign spending is regulated. You can only accept money under certain conditions, you can only spend that money under specific conditions, and that spending needs to be reported.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"9222, 9205, 8144, 7753, 7626, 7595, 7596, 7597, 7599, 7600, 7603, 7618, 7619, 7592, 7265, 7296","repeated_count":"16","date":"12/13/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
