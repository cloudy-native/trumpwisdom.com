He said in March 2016, three months before the June 23 vote on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union, that he thinks “Britain will separate from the EU. I think that maybe it’s time, especially in light of what’s happened with the craziness that is going on with immigration, with people pouring in all over the place I think that Britain will end up separating from the EU.” He was less sure about it on June 22, the day before the vote: “I don't think anybody should listen to me because I haven't really focused on it very much.\" As for being at Turnberry, he was there the day after the vote, not the day of the vote.
