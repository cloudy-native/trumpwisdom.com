And he beat Barack Obama all over the country.”","analysis":"There is no mystery here. Turnout was especially high in many battleground states. Texas broke its 1992 record by over five percentage points, despite continuing to restrict access to mail-in ballots. Turnout in Minnesota reached nearly 80 percent. Compared to the 2012 election, Biden received more votes than Obama did in 2012 in all but five states – Mississippi, Iowa, North Dakota, Ohio, West Virginia. Biden did better than Obama in all the swing states that Trump has been contesting: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia. Compared to the 2008 election: Biden received more votes than Obama did in 2008 in all but 11 states. Obama did better in two swing states that Trump has been contesting: Michigan and Wisconsin.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
