I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those “games”, especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost!”","analysis":"Trump apparently offered this unilateral concession to North Korea without consulting with the Pentagon or the government of South Korea. It’s unclear what the annual war games cost. Trump offered no figures for his claiming of saving “a tremendous amount of money.” South Korea pays about 50 percent of the total non-personnel costs of U.S. troop presence on the peninsula, according to the Congressional Research Service. Given that this is a training exercise, troops still need training, so presumably canceling this particular exercise will not reduce such expenses.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"9199, 3355, 3343, 3370","repeated_count":"4","date":"03/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
