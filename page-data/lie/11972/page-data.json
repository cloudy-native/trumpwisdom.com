They sue on everything, always in search of a crime. I even got sued on a Foundation which took Zero rent & expenses & gave away … more money than it had. Going on for years, originally brought by Crooked Hillary’s Campaign Chair, A.G. Eric Schneiderman, until forced to resign for abuse against women. … That’s right, The Trump Foundation gave away 100% plus, with Zero rent or expenses charged, and has been being sued by Cuomo and New York State for years - another part of the political Witch Hunt.”","analysis":"Trump settled a suit over alleged fraudulent practices at Trump University for $25 million. He also settled a lawsuit alleging self-dealing at the Trump Foundation and agreed to shut it down. The state was still seeking $2.8 million in restitution when Trump's charity closed. That lawsuit was brought by Barbara Underwood when she was the state attorney general, not by Schneiderman.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
