There's no evidence liberal billionaire George Soros paid people to protest Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court. Soros's Open Society Foundations gave grants for other, specific programs to one of the groups protesting Kavanaugh. That grant money came with strings attached -- most of it was designated for Puerto Rico rebuilding after Hurricane Maria -- and was not used to pay protesters.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"6067, 5572, 5337, 5380, 5486, 5151, 5628","repeated_count":"7","date":"10/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
