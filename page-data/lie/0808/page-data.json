And everybody was saying, well, you won’t get any mining jobs.  We picked up 45,000 mining jobs, and the miners are very happy with Trump and with Pence.”","analysis":"Trump is not specific, but administrations officials have previously suggested that these are coal mining jobs. But most of the so-called gain in “mining” jobs has nothing to do with coal. Most of the new jobs were in a subcategory called “support activities for mining,” and 75 percent of the jobs in the “support for mining” subcategory are in oil and gas operations. The plunge in oil prices that started in 2014 wiped out nearly 200,000 jobs in the oil and gas support sector by October, but a recent stabilization in oil prices has helped bring some of those jobs back. It has little to do with administration policy — and nothing to do with coal mining. The reality is that fewer than 1,000 coal jobs have been added since Trump became president.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/17/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
