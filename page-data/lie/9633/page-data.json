The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!”","analysis":"With phrases such as “only take from the USA” and “our farmers,” Trump appears to suggest Puerto Ricans are not full U.S. citizens. They are citizens, though they generally do not pay federal income tax unless they work for the federal government; they pay other federal taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare.

But neither Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló nor a federal board that oversees the territory’s finances have argued that federal disaster relief funds should be used to directly pay off debts. Rosselló and other local leaders have actively advocated against such a move.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
