I don't want this to happen, and that’s what the expression put out last night means. It was spoken as a fact, not as a statement. ”","analysis":"Trump tried to explain an earlier tweet which was labeled by Twitter with this notice: \"This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence. However, Twitter has determined that it may be in the public’s interest for the Tweet to remain accessible.\" In the earlier tweet, Trump harkened back to an infamous 1967 comment by Miami's police chief. He called the protesters in Minneapolis “thugs” and said: “When the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump later told reporters, \"I've heard that phrase for a long time. I don't know where it came from or where it originated.... it means when there's looting, people get shot and they die.\" We're including this in the database because it is debatable about whether Trump really did not know the racist undertones of this phrase and thus his explanation here does not appear credible.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
