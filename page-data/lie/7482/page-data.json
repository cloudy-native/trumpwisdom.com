A lot of the wall is built. It’s been very effective. I asked for a couple of notes on that. If you look at San Diego, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent once the wall was up. El Paso, illegal traffic dropped 72 percent, then ultimately 95 percent once the wall was up. In Tucson, Arizona, illegal traffic dropped 92 percent. Yuma, it dropped illegal traffic 95 to 96 percent.”","analysis":"These flashy numbers don't hold water as an argument for the wall. Immigration to the United States from the southern border has declined sharply from its recent peak in the early 2000s due to a variety of socioeconomic factors. Southwest border apprehensions are down at these sectors Trump listed — but he’s comparing current rates with the immigration boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, and his baseline is a moving target. For San Diego, his comparison goes back 23 years, to 1992, when a wall went up in that border area. For El Paso, 1993; Tucson, 2000; and Yuma in 2005, according to materials from the White House.\n\nSo, yes, the numbers are down in San Diego, El Paso, Tucson and Yuma, but they're also down as a general matter and in border sections without these barriers. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials reported 1.6 million southwest border apprehensions for fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2017, CBP reported nearly 304,000. That’s an 81.5 percent decline overall. (Border apprehensions have been rising this year.) According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the San Diego fence Trump mentioned, by itself, “did not have a discernible impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens coming across the border.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/11/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
