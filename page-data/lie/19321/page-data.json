They've been fighting with each other for years. Why do we have thousands of soldiers?' Ultimately, we got it down to 57 soldiers and then 27 soldiers. And then they were getting a little hostile toward each other. I said, 'Get my 27 soldiers out.' And that was about a year ago.”","analysis":"Trump frequently and misleadingly says there has been a conflict lasting \"hundreds of years\" or \"centuries\" between the Turks and the Kurds, apparently as explanation for why a U.S. role in the region would be fruitless. This is not only simplistic but historically ignorant and false. There has been a hundred-year effort to create a Kurdish state in the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, with the Kurds frequently manipulated by great powers seeking to flex their muscles against a particular nation. The  Kurdish people are not natural enemies of the Turks and their history has periods of peace and suppression between violence.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"24488, 21579, 19321, 16511, 16648, 16806, 14482, 14489, 15464, 15518, 14695, 14704, 14362, 14343, 14101, 15135, 13970, 13971, 14005, 15119, 13913, 15038, 13805, 13809, 13865","repeated_count":"25","date":"05/07/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
