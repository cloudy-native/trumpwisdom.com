He gave me company after company -- automobile company -- moving to Michigan, moving to Ohio, moving to Pennsylvania. You don't really need 'em over here, you're doing so well. But you want one? I'll get you one, too. No, but they're moving. And I'm not just talking about automobile companies.”","analysis":"No Japanese automakers are building new plants in Michigan or Pennsylvania. Toyota and Mazda are building a new plant, but it's in Alabama. Japan is a free-market economy. The prime minister has no authority to tell Japanese automakers where to locate their plants. Trump often says that car plants are moving into Pennsylvania, a swing state. No automakers have announced plans for a new plant in Pennsylvania since Trump took office.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/01/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
