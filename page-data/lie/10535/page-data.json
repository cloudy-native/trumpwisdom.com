I gave them other lawyers. Anybody you want, you can talk to. At the end of the testimony: no collusion and, essentially, no obstruction. Of course, a lot of people say, ‘How can you obstruct when there was no crime? When there was no collusion, can you possibly obstruct?’”","analysis":"Trump himself declined to be interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller's team and repeatedly tried to stymie or curtail the investigation. Obstruction of justice is a crime unto itself, regardless of whether the underlying crime being investigated is proven. The Mueller report says Trump's campaign was aware of Russia's efforts to disseminate stolen Democratic materials and welcomed them, but investigators did not find enough evidence that Trump campaign officials conspired with Russians. The report also lays out at least four episodes in which Trump met all the elements of an obstruction offense under federal law: the effort to fire Mueller, the effort to curtail the investigation, the order to the White House counsel to deny the attempt to fire Mueller, and the remarks raising a possibility of a pardon for Paul Manafort.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"31003, 30831, 30773, 29795, 29880, 30462, 29206, 28070, 28181, 26949, 27044, 26237, 24571, 23432, 21342, 19846, 19620, 19628, 17297, 16927, 16677, 16464, 16311, 16013, 14770, 14175, 13517, 12950, 13399, 12854, 13678, 12996, 12771, 12650, 11582, 11653, 11654, 11533, 11352, 11556, 12135, 12151, 12070, 12236, 12030, 11979, 11449, 11479, 11834, 11858, 11865, 11162, 11167, 11775, 11818, 11113, 11009, 11730, 11733, 11096, 10814, 10800, 10740, 10788, 10965, 10727, 10662, 10675, 10676, 10714, 10776, 10780, 10439, 10958, 10589, 10593, 10653, 10772, 10414, 10571, 10572, 10937, 10390, 10535, 10543, 10851, 10383, 10357, 10332, 10342, 10346, 10289, 10123, 10125, 10207, 10094, 10157, 9876, 9962, 10115, 10020, 10023, 10072, 10058, 10064, 10065, 10066, 10067, 9747, 9756, 9999, 9903, 9969, 9848, 9933, 9961, 9827, 9741, 9792, 9658, 9495, 9561","repeated_count":"122","date":"05/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
