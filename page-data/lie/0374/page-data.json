It's at 93 -- which is the highest it's ever been -- 93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future.  It was a 27 percent increase over two months ago when it was also high because of the administration, and much higher than it's ever been -- 93 percent.  Highest it's ever been.”","analysis":"Trump is citing a survey by the National Association of Manufacturers but that is not necessarily representative of all manufacturers. NAM declined to say whether NAM members are randomly surveyed -- and NAM members make up just six percent of manufacturing firms. This is a very low level of coverage for a survey of any population attempting to represent all industries.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"0448, 0369","repeated_count":"2","date":"04/11/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
