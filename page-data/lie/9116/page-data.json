It does not even provide record funding to the U.S. military in raw dollars: Obama had $710 billion in 2011 and $714 billion in 2010. A better way to measure over time is as a percentage of the economy, and Trump’s is only one-third the size of the defense budget at the height of the Vietnam War.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
