And, you know, a drug dealer will kill sometimes more than 2,000 people. Sometimes much more than that. Ruin families, ruin lives. And they get caught; they'll get 30 days in jail. They get a fine. They won't even get jail. They'll get a year in jail.”","analysis":"Once again, the president ends up in Four-Pinocchio territory because of the way he frames his rhetoric. He may have a point that “kingpin” drug dealers are responsible for at least hundreds of deaths. But then he cannot turn around and say they only end up with 30 or so days in prison if they are caught. A handful of drug dealers might get by with a little prison time, but those are the small fry, not the people responsible for many deaths.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"2921, 2593, 2592","repeated_count":"3","date":"03/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
