You can't let 15 and 20 years of leaves and broken trees and deadwood -- that after the first 18 months is dry as a bone -- you can't let that be there. You have to clean it.

In any event, experts say the most recent wildfires besetting California were not sparked by forest management problems such as an overpopulation of trees or a lack of raking. “The ones in Southern California are burning in chaparral, so it’s not a forest management issue at all,” LeRoy Westerling, a climate and fire researcher at the University of California at Merced, told us. “The fire in Northern California didn’t start in forest; it started in other types of vegetation, from what I read. … There, you're talking about what kind of vegetation people manage on their homes on private properties.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"26991, 27314, 25360, 25166, 26006, 24729, 24183, 24261, 24124, 24138, 24144, 24146, 24035, 23987, 20985, 17451, 14783, 14154, 14263, 12161, 11078, 10474, 8033, 7302, 7233, 7484, 6114, 4266, 4267","repeated_count":"29","date":"06/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
