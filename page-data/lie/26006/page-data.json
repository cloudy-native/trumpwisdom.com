If that is cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn't be getting those calls. You know, in Europe, they live their forest cities. They call forest cities. They maintain their forests. They manage their fires. I was with the head of a major country. It’s a forest city. He said, sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California. They shouldn't be that problem.”","analysis":"Half of the forested land in California is managed by the federal government, and those officials out of necessity have diverted forest management funds to deal with the rash of wildfires.
