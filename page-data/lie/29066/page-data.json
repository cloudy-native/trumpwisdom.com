They brought it down from lifetime to four months, but that's okay.”","analysis":"After his bout with covid-19, Trump repeatedly declared he was now immune. But that's false, according to government experts. The coronavirus that causes covid-19 is so new that scientists don't know with any certainty how long any possible immunity to the coronavirus lasts. “There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again; this is called natural immunity,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html\">said a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage</a> updated on Oct. 14. We have not been including in this database instances when Trump acknowledges he may be immune for a shorter period of time, such as four months, but this statement qualifies for inclusion because he somehow suggests the standard was changed only because he got sick.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"30894, 29434, 29066, 29151, 28538, 28395, 28772, 27876, 27710, 27260, 27279, 25759, 25672, 25710, 25478, 25620","repeated_count":"16","date":"10/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
