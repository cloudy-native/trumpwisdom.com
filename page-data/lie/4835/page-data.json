Saying repeat after me, read this statement.I have been abused. I need safety, it is for my personal health. Oh okay, congratulations. You've just become a citizen of the United States of America. I have to tell you folks this country what they're doing is crazy. What's happening, it's crazy! It's not rational, I think they're, so they're so and I say it they're so incensed and so wild over the fact that we easily won an election that they were expected to win that that they're no longer rest, no they're, no longer rational.”","analysis":"This is eerily similar to a claim from Attorney General Jeff Sessions when he claimed that \"dirty immigration lawyers\" were coaching their clients to cite credible fear as the reason they were crossing the border. But here's the thing. The data show that people from Central America, where violence and humanitarian abuses have surged, make up most of the credible fear claims. About 80 percent of the time, a trained immigration official ruled that the cases are legitimate, requiring a court ruling. There's no concrete evidence to suggest there's weight to this clam.
