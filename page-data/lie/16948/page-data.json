Somebody said he [Roger Stone] put out a tweet, and the tweet, you based it on that. We have killers, we have murderers all over the place -- nothing happens. And then they put a man in jail and destroy his life, his family, his wife, his children.”","analysis":"What Stone did should be clear to Trump -- Stone's false statements were aimed at protecting Trump. He testified before the House Intelligence Committee on Sept. 26, 2017, a few months after Trump had fired FBI Director James B. Comey and Mueller had been appointed to consider whether Trump’s campaign had coordinated with Russia’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 campaign. By denying his own contacts with WikiLeaks during the hearing, Stone prevented the public from knowing about a possible connection between Trump and that Russian effort.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
