And he wanted him to go to jail for two years. He said he did commit a problem, but he was mandated to put him in jail for 28 years. And he actually left the bench; he quit. He was a highly respected judge and is a respected person. He left the bench.”","analysis":"Trump <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2018/09/07/trump-kardashian-chris-young-nashville-judge-prison-reform/1214072002/\">appears to be talking about former federal judge Kevin Sharp</a>. Sharp visited the White House in September with a number of criminal justice reform advocates including Kim Kardashian to tell the story of Chris Young. Due to three strikes laws, Sharp was required to sentence Young to life in prison — not 28 years as Trump claimed. Sharp felt the sentence was too harsh and ultimately it contributed to him leaving the federal bench.
