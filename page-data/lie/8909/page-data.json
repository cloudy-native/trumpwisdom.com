When I first came in, or, really, more particularly, at the end of the last administration, there were rockets going up, there were missiles going up. There were bombs going off. There were massive cannons being tested. If you ever saw the picture of the beach, I've never seen anything like it, where you had, literally, thousands of cannons on the beach, shooting out into the waters. And there was nuclear testing. In fact, they thought it was earthquakes. They said they were massive earthquakes, and then they realized it was North Korea. … Now there's no testing, there's no rockets. There's no nuclear testing. … That hasn't happened in a long time -- 16 months, 17 months. No more testing. No more rockets. No more checking to see whether or not this stuff works.”","analysis":"Although Kim Jong Un has agreed to temporarily stop conducting missile and nuclear tests during ongoing negotiations over North Korea's nuclear program, Trump's description leaves out important information -- some of it collected by U.S. intelligence agencies. For example, The Washington Post <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/summit-collapse-foils-chance-to-press-north-korea-on-suspicious-sites/2018/05/25/d5a14044-602d-11e8-9ee3-49d6d4814c4c_story.html?utm_term=.cad08e039127\">has reported</a> on the possible existence of a second (secret) uranium-enrichment plant in North Korea. The New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/world/asia/north-korea-tests-tactical-weapon.html\">has reported</a> that the North Koreans tested a new tactical weapon during the period Trump mentions, although that was not apparently a long-range ballistic missile, which the North Koreans pledged to stop testing.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/24/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
