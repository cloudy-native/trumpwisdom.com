He claims not to know the answer.] To me, it doesn't bother me at all. I don't know about it. I read one quick article. The lawyer happens to be a brilliant lawyer, as you probably know. He wrote an article saying there could be a problem. It's not something that I'm going to be pursuing.”","analysis":"Trump refuses to concede that Sen. Kamala Harris, who was born in Oakland, Calif., is eligible to serve as president or vice president under the Constitution. Instead, he promotes a quack article that ignores the text of the 14th Amendment and the Supreme Court's interpretation of it to suggest Harris's eligibility might be in question. It should be noted that Harris is the daughter of a Black father and Indian mother, and that Trump for years promoted the racist \"birther\" conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not born in the United States and was therefore ineligible to serve as president.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
