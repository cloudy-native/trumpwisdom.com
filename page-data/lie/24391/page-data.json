That's a big deal. I don't know. I should have gotten nominated seven times because we did a lot of other things, but these are for two different deals.

He was just nominated.”","analysis":"Nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize is not as “big” of a deal (or as pristine) as the president suggests. Indeed, there are 318 candidates for the 2020 prize. Moreover, it does not somehow guarantee a fond place in history. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trumps-nobel-nonsense/\">put it clearly</a>: “Indeed, some of history’s most vilified figures have been nominated for the prize. Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was nominated twice: in 1945 for his effort to end World War II and again in 1948 by a professor from the Czech Republic. And fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was nominated in 1935 by two law professors, one from Germany and the other from France. (Adolf Hitler was nominated in 1939 — the nomination was later withdrawn — by “an anti-fascist member of the Swedish parliament who never intended his submission to be taken seriously,” according to Nobel archives.)” Sometimes, Trump will falsely say the news media avidly covered Barack Obama's nomination but not his; in fact, it had not been reported that Obama had been nominated, which is why Obama winning the honor was such a surprise -- and covered extensively in the media.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"30271, 29719, 28578, 28256, 27961, 26678, 26474, 26126, 25704, 25578, 25327, 25352, 25220, 25263, 26579, 25902, 25125, 25059, 24863, 24690, 24612, 24391, 24176, 24101, 23935, 23936, 23785, 23856","repeated_count":"28","date":"09/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
