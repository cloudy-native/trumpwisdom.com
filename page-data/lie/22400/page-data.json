It fell by 0.6 percent for the 12 months ending Dec. 2018, the first time in 46 years, not over 50 years.  Moreover, the Bureau of Labor Statistics <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CUSR0000SEMF01?output_view=pct_12mths\">says</a> there are other 12-month periods with index declines including one as recently as 2013. Prices rose 3 percent in the 12-month period ending Dec. 2019, and then kept rising after that. Trump also often falsely suggests this would not have ever happened under Democrats -- when in fact it did.
