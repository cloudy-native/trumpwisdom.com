And we made more progress [on North Korea] in that four or five months than they've made in 70 years. And nobody else could have done what I've done.”","analysis":"The status quo has not changed as it relates to North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Bill Clinton negotiated a nuclear agreement with North Korea that froze its plutonium program and was working on a missile deal. But that agreement fell apart under George W. Bush. Then Bush tried to negotiate a deal, even lifting sanctions on North Korea. But those tentative agreements fell apart as well and Obama was unable to make much more progress. Trump signed a vague joint statement on denuclearization with Kim Jong Un at a summit meeting June 12, but there has not been substantial progress after that.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"12717, 13087, 11402, 12239, 11007, 11337, 11916, 11917, 11441, 11882, 11028, 10925, 10840, 10737, 9218, 9160, 9064, 9003, 8819, 8394, 8353, 8081, 7905, 7870, 7695, 7555, 7467, 6527, 7024, 6263, 6298, 6225, 6415, 5456, 6323, 6077, 6090, 5357, 5381, 5327, 5530, 5776, 5143, 5146, 5171, 5129, 5072, 5974, 4820, 4879, 4591, 4366, 4368, 4409, 4511, 4329, 3668, 3439, 3561, 3970, 3519, 3356, 3357, 3372","repeated_count":"64","date":"11/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
