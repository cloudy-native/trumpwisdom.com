They got it knowingly wrong. We had polls that were so ridiculous, and everybody knew that at the time. There was no blue wave that they predicted. They thought there was going to be a big blue wave; that was false. That was done for suppression reasons. But instead, there was a big red wave....These really phony polls -- I have to call them phony polls, fake polls -- were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden, and diminish Republicans' ability to raise funds. They were what's called 'suppression polls.' Everyone knows that now.”","analysis":"News and polling organizations do not publish fake polls or “suppression polls,” which in Trump’s parlance are polls that relay false information to demoralize and dissuade people from voting.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31336, 30926, 30578, 30422, 30332, 30448, 29561, 29738, 30017, 28919, 28476, 28721, 28046, 28140, 28280, 27881, 25738, 25637, 25219, 24706, 24533, 24387, 23942, 22651, 22636","repeated_count":"25","date":"11/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
