He repeatedly questioned the accuracy of BLS employment statistics, and called figures calculated by career economists as \"phony.\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked about this contradiction at a news briefing after the report’s release. His response: “I talked to the president prior to this and he said to quote him very clearly. They may have been phony in the past, but it’s very real now.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"3749, 3811, 3776, 3640, 3653, 3613, 3828, 3471, 3518, 3373, 3467, 3393, 3406, 3190, 3205, 3068, 2703, 2636, 2508, 2722, 2650, 2512, 2386, 2412, 2240, 2219, 2286, 2351, 2183, 2175, 2178, 2179, 2153, 2125, 2046, 2013, 1969, 1814, 1762, 1832, 1803, 1688, 1659, 1661, 1647, 1629, 1592, 1595, 1601, 1606, 1557, 1617, 1502, 1518, 1474, 1378, 1349, 1303, 1343, 1192, 1148, 1140, 1125, 1001, 1012, 0988, 1026, 0751, 0685, 0655, 0646, 0629, 0266, 0268, 0240, 0232, 0228, 0221","repeated_count":"78","date":"03/10/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
