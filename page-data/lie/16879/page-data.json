For example, the unemployment rate average was lower in Lyndon Johnson's second term than it had been under Trump. But when Johnson's first term is factored in, Trump gained the edge. Anyway, once unemployment soared because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump's talking point quickly became out of date -- showing the folly of making such claims before a presidential term is complete. By the time his term ended, Trump was the first president since World War II to leave office with a net reduction in jobs during his presidency.
