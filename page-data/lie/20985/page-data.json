They're starting again in California. I said, 'You got to clean your floors. You got to clean your forests.' They have many, many years of leaves and broken trees. And they're like, so flammable. You touch them and it goes up. I've been telling them this now for three years, but they don't want to listen....We say, 'You got to get rid of the leaves. You got to get rid of the debris. You got to get rid of the fallen trees.' You know when a tree falls, after 13 to 14 months, it becomes extremely dry. You look at some of these fires, they don't really catch where the trees are growing because they're wet. The water's pouring up the tree. And they just don't want to listen. They mocked us when I said that you got to clean your floors, just an expression. Clean the floors. And they have many, many years, decades of leaves, dry leaves.”","analysis":"Half of the forested land in California is managed by the federal government, and those officials out of necessity have diverted forest management funds to deal with the rash of wildfires. In any event, experts say the most recent wildfires besetting California were not sparked by forest management problems such as an overpopulation of trees or a lack of raking. “The ones in Southern California are burning in chaparral, so it’s not a forest management issue at all,” LeRoy Westerling, a climate and fire researcher at the University of California at Merced, told us. “The fire in Northern California didn’t start in forest; it started in other types of vegetation, from what I read. … There, you're talking about what kind of vegetation people manage on their homes on private properties.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"26991, 27314, 25360, 25166, 26006, 24729, 24183, 24261, 24124, 24138, 24144, 24146, 24035, 23987, 20985, 17451, 14783, 14154, 14263, 12161, 11078, 10474, 8033, 7302, 7233, 7484, 6114, 4266, 4267","repeated_count":"29","date":"08/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
