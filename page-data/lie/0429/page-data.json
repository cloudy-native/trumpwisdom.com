Watch!”","analysis":"Trump is wrong about how he characterizes these polls. Both the final Post-ABC poll (47-43) and NBC/WSJ poll (44-40) had Clinton ahead by four points; both outlets emphasized the four-way result, but also tested preferences excluding third-party candidates that showed +3 for Post-ABC and +5 for NBC/WSJ. Clinton won the national popular vote by 2.1 points. This level of error is quite good for national pre-election polls in the United States.
