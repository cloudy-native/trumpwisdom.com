It's not even close. Fraud and illegality ARE a big part of the case. Documents being completed. We will appeal!”","analysis":"The 2020 presidential election was not rigged or stolen -- and not a hoax. Biden won a solid victory in the Electoral College, 306-232, and won a majority of the popular vote, beating Trump by more than 7 million votes. Trump and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits in six swing states, but virtually all were rejected for lack of evidence or standing, often by judges appointed by Trump. Biden’s margin of victory in many key states was significantly higher than Trump’s margin four years earlier. For instance, Biden won Michigan by more than 150,000 votes, compared with Trump’s margin of about 11,000 in 2016. Attorney General William Barr said there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the election. For months leading up to the election, Trump kept falsely claiming that the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged -- making his loss a self-fulfilling prophecy.
