MS-13 is active in prisons and in a few areas such as Los Angeles, Long Island and the D.C. region. Experts say Trump exaggerates the threat posed by the gang.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/03/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
