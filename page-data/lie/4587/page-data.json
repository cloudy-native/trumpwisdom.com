He told that to the press, they didn't report it. Forty-four billion... So I got them to pay $100 billion. It's gonna be much more than that, but tremendous amounts of money, tremendous. They gotta pay up, they're paying up.”","analysis":"Excluding the U.S., NATO members have collectively increased defense spending by $11.4 billion over the past year, when adjusted for inflation and using 2010 prices and exchange rates. Trump could be referencing the same calculation in today’s dollars, which comes to $34 billion, not $44 billion or $100 billion. Plus, the notion that they are \"paying more\" is still very misguided. This is simple what countries spend on their own defense.
