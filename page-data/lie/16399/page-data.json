The JCPOA’s prohibition on Iran building nuclear weapons does not expire. Other international agreements to which Iran has committed itself also prohibit the development of such weapons. Critics of the JCPOA have voiced concerns that, despite these commitments, Iran could keep working toward nuclear weapons capability under the guise of pursuing peaceful goals, such as a nuclear energy program. The JCPOA gradually lifts restrictions on the types of nuclear activities and the level of uranium enrichment Iran may conduct. These and other provisions sunset over 10, 15, 20 or 25 years. Trump administration officials argue that easing these restrictions over time would open the door to nuclear weapons development in Iran, rendering the JCPOA ultimately ineffective. Supporters of the nuclear accord say the JCPOA at least buys time, subjecting Iran to strong constraints on its nuclear activities for 10 to 25 years. Without the deal in place, Iran could hasten its development of nuclear weapons on an even shorter timeline than the one Trump found unsatisfactory, they say.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"28085, 28343, 24941, 24738, 24328, 22381, 20996, 18091, 17762, 16102, 16122, 16167, 16399, 13215, 13369, 13629, 13121, 12144, 12126, 11406, 11991, 11444, 11886, 11906, 11245, 11879, 11880, 11740, 10825, 10669, 10683, 7945","repeated_count":"32","date":"01/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
