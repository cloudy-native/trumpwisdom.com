He barely worked @TheJusticeDept and was either fired/quit, didn't want the scrutiny? Now he hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success. POTUS doesn't even know him!\" Conway responded by showing a laudatory letter to him from Trump as well as evidence that he had been offered a senior-level job in the Justice Department, which he turned down. Conway's wife, Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, later confirmed to Fox News on March 31 that her husband \"changed his mind\" about working for Trump and \"withdrew himself from consideration at the White House.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"9398","repeated_count":"1","date":"03/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
