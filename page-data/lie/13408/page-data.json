And, ‘Don't go with the Republicans,’ and, ‘Stay with us.’ And -- like it's a political war. They shouldn't have done that. That should be an impeachable event, I guess, based on what you're saying.”","analysis":"Trump claimed that three Democratic senators — Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), Richard J. Durbin (Ill.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.) — “implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake and that if they didn't do the right thing they wouldn't get any assistance.” He later referred to “senators that threatened him with votes and no money coming into Ukraine if they do things.” Trump suggested this was the “real deal,” unlike allegations that he held up military aid to force the Ukrainian government to investigate the Bidens. Trump is referring to a letter written in 2018, and it does not say what he claims. The letter, written to the special prosecutor at the time, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressed concern about a New York Times report that Ukraine had stopped cooperating with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to avoid upsetting Trump. The letter does not threaten a loss of aid, though it notes that the Times article said that the freezing of cooperation was motivated by a worry that Trump would cut off aid. (The article was titled: “Ukraine, Seeking U.S. Missiles, Halted Cooperation with Mueller Investigation.”)  The letter noted the signers have supported efforts to build Ukraine’s democracy and expressed “disappointment” that some lawmakers in Kiev were trying “to avoid the ire of President Trump.” The senators then ask a series of questions, seeking to clarify whether the Times report was correct and whether the Trump administration had encouraged the government not to cooperate with Mueller. Lutsenko never responded. Since the letter was sent, the three senators have voted for nearly $870 million in additional aid to Ukraine, with Leahy and Durbin (members of the Senate Appropriations Committee) voting in committee on Sept. 26 for an additional $448 million in fiscal 2020, an increase over 2018 and 2019.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"12949, 13027, 13234, 13386, 13408","repeated_count":"5","date":"09/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
