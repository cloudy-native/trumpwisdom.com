If you’re connected to Donald Trump, you get people like Robert Mueller & Andrew Weissman, and his team of partisans, coming after you with a vengeance and abusing their........positions of power. That’s part of the story of the Russia Hoax. Christopher Steele is on the payroll of Hillary Clinton & the FBI, & when they fired him for lying, they continued to use him. Violation of FBI regulations. Kept trying to verify the unverifiable.' @GreggJarrett”","analysis":"The Justice Department inspector general found no bias or improper considerations in the way the FBI handled the Clinton email investigation, whereas several Trump campaign advisers have pleaded guilty or been convicted. There's no evidence special counsel Robert Mueller has abused his power. As for alleged collusion between the Democrats and Russia, Trump is referring to the fact that Fusion GPS, which {assembled the dossier as part of an assignment for Democrats}, relied on a British intelligence agent who used Russian sources for his research. So that's a rather big stretch.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"29793, 30463, 26500, 26298, 26320, 26074, 25663, 25938, 25821, 25116, 23000, 21075, 21709, 17181, 16380, 16365, 15903, 13880, 13057, 12907, 12956, 11657, 11674, 12241, 11860, 11862, 11871, 11772, 11765, 11745, 11010, 11087, 10917, 10748, 10791, 10442, 10452, 10658, 10773, 10569, 10576, 10392, 10536, 9863, 10078, 10018, 9969, 9739, 9562, 9233, 9180, 8914, 8702, 9459, 8547, 8346, 8512, 8516, 8114, 7747, 7710, 7279, 7429, 7270, 7214, 7171, 5555, 6074, 5590, 5391, 6060, 5025, 4734, 4735, 4611, 4680, 4501, 4384, 4467, 4331, 4269, 3954, 3662, 3630, 3643, 3617, 3444, 3313, 3322, 3249, 3137, 2985, 2948, 2943, 2724, 2604, 8933, 2308, 2308, 2034, 2106, 1983, 1983, 1979, 1891, 1891, 1898, 1965, 1539, 1539, 1568, 1568, 1412, 1412, 0010","repeated_count":"115","date":"09/01/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
