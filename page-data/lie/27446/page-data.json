And you know what, that was at one o'clock in the morning, it was now election day remember? And Crooked Hillary came and it was unexpected...Barack Hussein Obama, Michelle Obama, Oprah and Hillary, they actually forgot about Hillary. And it was unexpected. And I heard about it and I said, 'that means that they have a problem.' 'Cause remember they came here the night before, 500 people showed up.”","analysis":"The Michigan venue where Trump rallied in the early morning hours of Election Day 2016 has a capacity of 4,200, far less than the 32,000 claimed by Trump. Hillary Clinton held a rally the same day at nearby Grand Valley State University; it was described as a “capacity crowd” at a venue that holds 4,100 people. Neither Barack nor Michelle Obama attended this Clinton rally, so this claim from Trump is false in every way.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"30291, 30316, 29648, 28797, 28139, 27446, 25051, 24635, 18321, 12412, 5430","repeated_count":"11","date":"10/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
