It's not fair. We picked up tremendous stock market and economic numbers. They actually went wild the day after I won.

It would've gone in the opposite direction had the other result taken place, which, fortunately, it didn't.”","analysis":"Trump inherited an economy that was in the middle of one of the longest post-World War II economic expansions on record. Most of the trends that Trump points to as \"success\" started under Obama. There is no evidence it would not have continued if Hillary Clinton had been elected and no evidence that electing a Democrat like Joe Biden would cause an economic crash.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"26057, 25864, 25078, 23601, 23313, 21910, 22390, 20967, 21585, 22447, 22538, 21055, 22290, 22133, 22147, 21050, 21901, 21384, 21643, 21473, 21411, 21429, 21190, 21092, 21168, 20255, 19804, 20265, 20757, 19765, 16952, 17071, 17221, 17844, 18378, 17174, 16624, 16526, 16268, 15824, 14773, 14554, 15667, 15564, 14966, 15532, 14580, 12372, 12401, 11694, 12090, 11079, 11246, 11256, 11164, 11170","repeated_count":"56","date":"11/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
