We have one city or two cities in particular -- worse than Honduras, worse than Afghanistan. Worse than Afghanistan.”","analysis":"This is a flawed apples-to-oranges comparison. You can't properly compare crime rates in cities with countries that have a mix of urban and rural areas. For instance, Baltimore, a common target of Trump's barbs. is a city. It would be more relevant compare the state of Maryland to these countries: The state had a homicide rate of 9 per 100,000 people, compared to Honduras (41).","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
