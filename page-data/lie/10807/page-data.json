No good.”","analysis":"The Central American migration phenomenon to the United States is driven by a mix of factors, including rampant gang violence and poverty in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Mexico has deported people from those countries more than 2 million times since 2001 and its numbers for apprehensions and deportations rival those of the United States. Migrants have a right under international law to petition any country for asylum, including the United States. The Mexican government is not actively behind any human trafficking or drug smuggling to the United States. Instead, the high demand for drugs in the United States and lax government control over northern Mexico facilitates the drug trade.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
