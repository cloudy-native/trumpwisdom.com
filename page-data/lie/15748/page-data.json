What we have done in that very famous vote, after campaigning for eight years to get rid of Obamacare, remember, repeal and replace was his campaign. And then, when he finally had a chance to repeal and replace it, 2 o'clock in the morning, he says, thumbs down.”","analysis":"Trump suggests that Sen. John McCain's vote was the only impediment to passing a repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. But none of the substantive replacement bills got nearly enough votes, and McCain's vote was against a \"skinny\" repeal that was only to lead to talks with the House on a common position, with no guarantee of an agreement that would pass both Houses. McCain had earlier voted for a version of repealing the ACA, but he objected to the skinny repeal because the process went against legislative tradition.
