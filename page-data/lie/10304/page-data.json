But here's the thing. The data show that people from Central America, where violence and humanitarian abuses have surged, make up most of the credible fear claims. About 80 percent of the time, a trained immigration official ruled that the cases are legitimate, requiring a court ruling. There's no concrete evidence to suggest there's weight to this clam.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"10304, 10047, 9905, 9841, 9891, 9781","repeated_count":"6","date":"04/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
