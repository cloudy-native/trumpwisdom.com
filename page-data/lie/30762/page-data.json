An elderly woman -- we have her deposition -- was told -- who longed to vote, looked forward to the day of November 3, was told when she got in there, I'm sorry, you voted. And then they give her another ballot to sign, which they don't use, because she already voted.”","analysis":"This has been a persistent claim by the Trump campaign in various states — that Trump supporters went to vote, only to find their ballot had already been cast (presumably by Democratic operatives) and thus they were given a provisional ballot. But this is another fairy tale. No evidence has ever emerged to prove this. Trump’s chief lawyer, former New York mayor Rudolph W.

(Obviously, the problem can exist and appears to result from clerical errors. There is no evidence it occurs in great numbers, is intentional, or disadvantages one party more than then the other.)","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31117, 30817, 30795, 30762, 31413, 30716","repeated_count":"6","date":"11/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
