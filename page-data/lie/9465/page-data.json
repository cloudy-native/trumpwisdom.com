Meanwhile, Fox News and CNN’s morning shows are down 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, year over year., according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-wrong-morning-joe-ratings-fact-check/\">an examination of the data</a> by The Wrap. \"While 'Morning Joe' ratings are down so far this week versus last, it’s hard to justify that they’ve 'tanked.'\" the article said. The article also threw cold water on Trump's claim of a 50 percent drop at MSNBC and CNN: \"Per Nielsen ratings, not one MSNBC show is down 50 percent following the Mueller release, though recent primetime shows have experienced declines hovering around that huge number on a year over year basis. CNN also has sizable drops — particularly on a March 2018 vs. March 2019 basis — but we do not see any version of declines approaching 50 percent.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
