You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!”","analysis":"Trump is referring to ABC News reporter Brian Ross, who was suspended after making an error in a report last year when he said Trump had directed his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to make contact with the Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign. Ross later corrected the report, noting that Trump made the request after the election when he was the president-elect, not a candidate. Ross and ABC News apologized for the mistake. So Trump is wrong to say there was no apology.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/31/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
