I hate to say that. I know nothing about it. I do know that they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard, but I know nothing about it.....If you'd like me to study the subject. I'll tell you what I do know about, I know about Antifa and I know about the radical left and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are, and I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats, not run by Republicans.....I just don't know about QAnon....hat I do hear about it is they are very strongly against pedophilia and I agree with that. I mean, I do agree with that.”","analysis":"It's simply not credible that a president of the United States would \"know nothing\" about QAnon, which the FBI <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/fbi-documents-conspiracy-theories-terrorism-160000507.html?soc_src=hl-viewer&soc_trk=tw\">has called</a> a domestic terrorist threat. The FBI said the origins of QAnon is the conspiratorial belief that “Q,” allegedly a government official, “posts classified information online to reveal a covert effort, led by President Trump, to dismantle a conspiracy involving ‘deep state’ actors and global elites allegedly engaged in an international child sex trafficking ring.” This is yet another example of Trump being unwilling to criticize extremist groups if he thinks they may be Trump supporters.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
