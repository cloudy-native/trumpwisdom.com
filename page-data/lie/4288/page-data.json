Somebody walks across the border, they put their foot on there, not even two feet, just one foot. And you might as well, “Welcome to the United States, we’ll never get you out of here,” OK? …You catch him, now you take his name and then you release him. And he’s supposed to show up to a court hearing. The problem is, there’s thousands and thousands of people, we don’t have enough judges … So, they come back three or four years later but here’s the problem: They never come back. They don’t come back. Why the hell would they come back? So, a very tiny percentage comes back. So, you catch a stone-cold criminal, you take his name, you see he’s the criminal, you see he’s bad in many cases. Catch and release. You catch him and you then release him.”","analysis":"Catch and release is a collection of policies, court precedents, executive actions and federal statutes spanning more than 20 years, cobbled together throughout Democratic and Republican administrations, including his own.

It would be rare for someone with a criminal record in the U.S. to claim asylum here. The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for tighter border controls, found in a 2017 report that “over the past 20 years, 37 percent of all aliens free pending their trials — 918,098 out of 2,498,375 — never showed for court.” That means 63 percent did show up.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26946, 26835, 26671, 27144, 26210, 26327, 25697, 25568, 25438, 25356, 24434, 24097, 23680, 21591, 22455, 18863, 17785, 16549, 16205, 16476, 16347, 14676, 12687, 11639, 11954, 11939, 11899, 11850, 11141, 11719, 10877, 10263, 10006, 9890, 9645, 9705, 9536, 9297, 9140, 9141, 8852, 8451, 8498, 8324, 8280, 8167, 8195, 8216, 8217, 8223, 7891, 7893, 7910, 7911, 7912, 7148, 7077, 7078, 7079, 7081, 6537, 6557, 6644, 6202, 6386, 6161, 6425, 6486, 5899, 5818, 4401, 4288, 4525, 3892, 3460, 3847, 3945, 3955, 3917, 3936, 3318, 3270, 3202, 3172, 3122, 3083, 2816, 2829, 2695","repeated_count":"89","date":"08/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
