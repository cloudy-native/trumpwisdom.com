Women are 61 years, soon to be historic. You know, historic, meaning ‘in history.’”","analysis":"Trump was president in May 2018, when the African American unemployment rate reached 5.9 percent. That was the lowest on record since 1972, when BLS began calculating this statistic with its current methodology. But history did not begin in 1972, so it’s a stretch to call these monthly figures the lowest ever seen in the United States. A slightly different data set shows black unemployment was lower in 1969, and another report shows it was lower in the 1950s. Moreover, the president keeps touting his record on black unemployment even though the pattern of declines began under Obama, and even as the black jobless rate has begun to climb in recent months. The Hispanic unemployment rate also dates to 1972. The Asian unemployment rate is newer and has been reported for nearly two decades. Both rates have rebounded in recent months after reaching lows.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"12533, 12344, 10056, 9939, 9803, 9290, 9309, 3724, 3754, 3882, 3868, 3812, 3592, 3829, 3472, 3517, 3374, 3359, 3300, 3392, 3405, 3330, 3168, 3191, 3206, 3069, 3044, 2966, 2956, 2937, 2769, 2704, 2669, 2735, 2723, 2564, 2507, 2432, 2312, 2260, 2221, 2285, 2303, 2352, 2206, 2184, 2162, 2154, 2117, 2127, 2141, 2047, 2009, 2014, 2010, 1126, 1139","repeated_count":"57","date":"04/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
