Elizabeth Warren's entrance to the 2020 presidential race. Warren released the results of her DNA test, which showed that she likely had a sixth generation ancestor with Native American heritage in the mid-1800s. Early news reports had incorrectly suggested a range of 1/64th to 1/1024th, which some misreported as less than the average European-American (hence the \"1/2020th\" joke). Trump has seized on the misleading news reports to incorrectly say she has no Native American heritage. She has some but her DNA is more than 95 percent European-American.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"24895, 24620, 24402, 17821, 17575, 17773, 17002, 17532, 16505, 16174, 15585, 13695, 11623, 12112, 10224, 7959, 7849, 6731, 7120, 6048, 6309, 6374, 6463, 5479, 5078, 5136, 5162, 5449, 6068","repeated_count":"29","date":"01/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
