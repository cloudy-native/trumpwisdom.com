They wanted to save money on ammunition. They didn't want to save money because they spent money like nobody ever spent money. But you know what? We now have a great military rebuilt. And we have so much ammunition, we don't know what to do with it. Okay? And that's a nice feeling to have.”","analysis":"Trump is onto something when he suggests that munitions were running low at the time he took office. After targeting Islamic State operatives with tens of thousands of smart bombs and guided missiles, U.S. military officials began to say publicly that stockpiles were growing thin. But the president’s disregard for details and accuracy gets him in trouble. Trump never limits his comments to PGMs and instead gives the impression that all ammunition was running out. Smart bombs may be the most important kind in the fight against terror, but it’s nevertheless an exaggerated claim. Moreover, at times Trump’s claim has morphed from “very little” ammunition to “no ammunition.” No military official has claimed that munitions, whether PGMs or for any other kind of weapon, were depleted, and officials in the Obama administration had already started to fix the problem by the time he took office.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30982, 30943, 29444, 29540, 30027, 28582, 28808, 28172, 27690, 27852, 27913, 27734, 28247, 26849, 27147, 27512, 26398, 26476, 26107, 25707, 25730, 25529, 25366, 19576, 18770, 18739, 19492, 19200, 18600, 18140, 17758, 18556, 18546, 18044, 16261, 15801, 14776, 15703, 14114, 14641, 14010, 13894, 13895, 13877, 13567, 13893, 13634, 13681, 6442","repeated_count":"49","date":"04/06/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
