South Korea in 2018 paid the United States about $830 million under the burden-sharing agreement, covering approximately 40 percent of the cost of the U.S. deployment. But that’s just a fraction of South Korea’s military costs. The country has increased its defense spending at a faster rate than the United States over the past decade, reaching [$39 billion] in 2017, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. South Korea also covered 90 percent of the cost of a new military base that came with a $10.8 billion price tag. It’s the largest U.S. military base overseas.
