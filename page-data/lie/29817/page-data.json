I don't care if you bring back Abraham Lincoln and George Washington as his running mate. You lose New York, Illinois, and California, okay? So now you're, you got three of the biggest and the biggest, but you have three monster states, that's an automatic loss.”","analysis":"Trump is correct that the Democrats can count on easily winning California, New York and Illinois. But Republicans have an advantage in the Electoral College because they have an edge in small, rural states, which in the electoral college system requires fewer votes per elector. In Wyoming, for instance, there are 143,000 people for each electoral vote, compared to 500,000 in a state like California. Since Democrats tend to concentrated in large cities, the impact of those votes are dissipated. This is one reason why in two recent elections – 2000 and 2016 -- the Democrat won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
