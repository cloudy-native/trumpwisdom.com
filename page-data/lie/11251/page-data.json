[Saudi Arabia] buy massive amounts, $150 billion worth of military equipment that, by the way, we use. We use that military equipment. And unlike other countries that don't have money and we have to subsidize everything. So Saudi Arabia is a big buyer of America product. That means something to me. It's a big producer of jobs.”","analysis":"The administration’s numbers are inflated. A review of the deals shows that many are not concluded and are simply aspirational. Moreover, many of the investments are in Saudi Arabia, making it difficult to argue that these will create many jobs for Americans. Other deals, such as the SoftBank fund and ExxonMobil Chemical deal in Texas, had been announced months earlier and thus are not appropriate for inclusion on a list of achievements from the president’s visit. As for the number of jobs created, many would end up in Saudi Arabia.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"13632, 11912, 11251, 7256, 6330, 6420, 6447, 5939, 5870, 5936","repeated_count":"10","date":"06/23/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
