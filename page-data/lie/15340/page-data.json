You remember how high, it was 60, 70%, has now reached the lowest number ever recorded in the history of our country.”","analysis":"This is an example of how Trump sometimes reaches back to a bogus figure he cited in the 2016 campaign, and then favorably compares it to a real number today. The African-American youth (16-24) unemployment rate did fall the lowest level since these employment numbers started to be calculated in 1972.  But notice how he claims it had been 60 to 70 percent. During the campaign, Trump had claimed it was 58 percent, for African-Americans ages 16-24, but that was the result of some very fuzzy math. The Trump campaign came up with the number by calculating the number of people classified as “unemployed” and “not in the labor force” as a percentage of the total civilian population.\n“Unemployed” refers to people who are available for work and actively looking for a job, but don’t have one. “Not in the labor force” refers to people who are not looking for jobs because they have given up looking or are not interested — such as students. The result of these machinations? It basically tripled the official rate in 2016 of 19.2 percent. If we applied Trump’s campaign math for the 2019 numbers – which show an official rate of 13.8 percent, a steep decline from 2016 -- the rate for African-Americans 16-24 would be 55 percent. \n\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
