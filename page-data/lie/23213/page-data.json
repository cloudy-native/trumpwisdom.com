Nielsen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.axios.com/tv-ratings-2020-national-conventions-4c3cba6b-0a2b-4e60-b57c-2124d56cc2b8.html\">says</a> the DNC averaged 21.57 million viewers in the 10 p.m. prime-time hour across the four nights that it aired last week, while the RNC averaged 18.8 million viewers over that period this week. Trump's nomination acceptance speech at the White House on Thursday was watched by 23.8 million people, just shy of the 24.6 million people who tuned in for Joe Biden's speech the week before. No one knows how many people streamed the conventions online or watched clips on social channels, but Trump routinely cites unverified figures.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"23259, 23213, 23087, 23089, 23091","repeated_count":"5","date":"09/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
