For decades it's been burning, but now it's gotten to a point they don't want to -- I watched the mayor try and get in with these people, and he went to a protest, and he went in and they almost killed him. If he didn't security with him -- he had five security guards -- he would have been dead, just like they would have done to Rand Paul, who's a great guy, and his wife, Kelley. It is a disgrace when you look at what's happening. Now, we sent in Homeland Security. The reason we sent them in was to protect our courthouse. We have a $300 million courthouse, and they wanted to blow up our courthouse or burn it down. Take your choice. Blow it up or burn it down, they said, and I said, no, no, that's not happening. So, they wouldn't protect it because the mayor said he doesn't care. So, we sent in our Homeland people. They did a great job. Immediately -- Homeland Security -- immediately it was protected and that's the only reason they were there. I've offered to send in the National Guard. I've offered to send in anybody they want. I could put that out in 45 minutes, and it would stop. And I think the people of Portland and the people of Oregon -- I know it's a liberal state, considered liberal -- they're tired of it. They're tired of having -- of living with this curse. They're living with a curse.”","analysis":"Protests in Portland in the weeks following the death of George Floyd in police custody continued long after most protests around the country had died down. The president often tells a story of federal agents sweeping in to forcibly stop the protests sometime after the 50th day, July 18, but federal forces were already in the city  — and had been for some time. \n\nFederal officials took a more obvious, aggressive stance toward protesters by July 1, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. They made 98 arrests during the month of July and filed federal charges in at least 75 of those cases, according to data from the U.S. attorney’s office in Oregon. Of those, the vast majority were for misdemeanors. \n\nStill, it is important to keep in mind that the more aggressive tactics — including detaining protesters in unmarked vehicles and use of less lethal munitions — employed by federal forces reanimated the protests, drawing hundreds more people each night. \n\nPortland Mayor Ted Wheeler explained the impact of federal presence simply, “As we were starting to see things de-escalate, their actions [federal forces] last Saturday night and every night since have actually ratcheted up the tension on our streets.” In other words, federal forces did the opposite of quelling protests.
