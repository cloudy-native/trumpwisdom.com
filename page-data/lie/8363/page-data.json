Look to final results! Don't know how my poll numbers are so good, especially up 19% with Hispanics?”","analysis":"Trump seizes on a subsection of a January NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll that indicates an increase in Latino support from month to month. The overall poll was not good for Trump, showing 39 percent approval, 53 percent disapproval — a 7-point net change from December when his rating was 42 percent approval, 49 percent disapproval. Moreover, the poll's finding on Latino support appear to be an outlier. Two other surveys  from The Post-ABC and Pew were conducted this month that included Spanish language interviews (the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll did not) found Trump to be less popular with Hispanics. The Post-ABC poll found just 18 percent of Hispanics approved of Trump, while Pew found the president had a 24 percent approval rate among Hispanics. Plus, 71 of the 1,023 people interviewed for the survey were Latino, a small sample which results in a significantly larger margin of error.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"8596, 8363, 8501, 8332, 8513, 8296, 8117","repeated_count":"7","date":"01/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
