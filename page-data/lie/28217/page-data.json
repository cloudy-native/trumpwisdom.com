The swine flu. It was one of the great, and far less lethal by the way, but it was one of the great catastrophes. Nobody knew what the hell they were doing.”","analysis":"Under fire for a sluggish response, Trump started to target the Obama administration, especially its handling of the 2009 swine flu outbreak. But it’s false to suggest Obama didn't do anything about it. In fact, Obama’s handling was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/02/health/02flu.html\">widely praised at the time</a> as the right mix of action and no overreaction. On April 26, 2009, when only 20 cases of H1N1 — and no deaths — around the country had been confirmed, the Obama administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency. The administration quickly sought funding from Congress, receiving almost $8 billion. Six weeks later, the World Health Organization declared a pandemic. On Oct. 24, after more than 1,000 Americans had died of H1N1, Obama declared a national emergency. The estimated death toll in the United States during the H1N1 epidemic was 12,469 from April 2009 to April 2010, but that was much less than a forecast of 30,000 to 90,000 deaths made in August of 2009 by the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. (Sometimes Trump claims that Biden was in charge of the effort but that's not true. And while Biden did -- once - mistakenly refer to the swine flu virus as “N1H1″ during a debate in March, 2020, the order of the two halves of the term used to describe the virus — referring to subtypes of two proteins on its surface: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) — is unimportant. Trump claims Biden constantly gets this mixed up.)","pinocchios":"4","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"31255, 31561, 31436, 31456, 29912, 30178, 30191, 30277, 29656, 30052, 28948, 28439, 28383, 28500, 29024, 28014, 27617, 27679, 28217, 26967, 27028, 26248, 25324, 25146, 25206, 25611, 26011, 24919, 24953, 24798, 24836, 24507, 24580, 24448, 24275, 24298, 23959, 23755, 23291, 23301, 21531, 21558, 22551, 21085, 20143, 19776, 19681, 19647, 18772, 18738, 19477, 19210, 18606, 17904, 17709, 17113, 17883, 17671, 17678, 18502, 17873, 17629","repeated_count":"62","date":"10/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
