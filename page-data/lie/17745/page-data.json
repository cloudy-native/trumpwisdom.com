Buy American!”","analysis":"The administration’s own analysis of the new environmental rule does not support these claims, The New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/climate/trump-pollution-rollback.html\">reported</a>:  \"The analysis found that the new rule, when fully in place, could impose an overall cost on the economy of up to $22 billion. It found that, despite saving money on the initial sticker price of a less-fuel-efficient new car, individual motorists could end up spending about $500 more on gasoline over the life of the vehicle. And it concluded that the rule would lead to the loss of roughly 13,000 jobs in the auto industry in a single year, model year 2029.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
