And these are tough people. They were strong, tough men and women. And half of them were crying because we basically -- our government stole their property. They couldn't do anything. They couldn't build. They couldn't do anything.They were crying. I said, \"What are you crying about?\" The one guy -- I don't think he cried in his whole life. I don't think he cried when we was a baby. He was crying. He said, 'Sir, you gave me back my life. You gave me back my property. They took it away -- environmentally, took it away. And you're going to do the right thing.'”","analysis":"Trump often likes to claim that people -- tough people -- cry in front of him because of his policies. So take this story with a grain of salt, especially since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca73cWtySvE&feature=youtu.be\">a video</a> of the February 2017 event does not show anyone crying. The president has frequently exaggerated the potential impact of the rule, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/03/02/trumps-claim-that-waters-of-the-united-states-rule-cost-hundreds-of-thousands-of-jobs/?utm_term=.7ed8c74a20a3\">claiming</a> in the past that it cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. There is no evidence to support that. After the rule was issued in 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit issued a nationwide stay blocking it from taking effect. We checked with key industry groups that opposed the rule, but did not find research into the impact of the rule on jobs after it was halted in 2015. The rule had been in limbo and then Trump signed an executive order instructing a review of the rule.
