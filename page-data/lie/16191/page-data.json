Trump in the past has relied on a study that was funded by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Council for Capital Formation, foes of the Paris Accord; the study assumed a scenario that no policy analyst expects — that the United States takes drastic steps to meet the Obama pledge of a 26 to 28 percent reduction in emissions by 2025. Moreover, the study did not consider possible benefits from reducing climate change. When Trump withdrew from the Paris Accord in 2017, he cited the impact by 2040, including a “cost to the economy” of nearly $3 trillion in lost gross domestic product. But in addition to an unrealistic scenario, that number must be viewed in context over more than two decades, so “$3 trillion” amounts to a reduction of 6 percent. That is not the same as 25-30 percent of U.S. businesses.
