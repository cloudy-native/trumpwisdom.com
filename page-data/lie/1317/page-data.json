Policy didn't work!”","analysis":"Under Bill Clinton's 1994 accord with North Korea, between 1995 and 2003 the United States <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R40095.pdf\">spent about $400 million</a> supplying the fuel oil to North Korea that was required under the deal. An international consortium spent about $2.5 billion to replace the North’s plutonium reactor with two light-water reactors; the project was not completed before the deal collapsed but the money mostly went to South Korean and Japanese companies, not North Korea. The United States stopped paying food assistance to North Korea after 2011, with the exception of $1 million in humanitarian aid in January 2017 that was negotiated by outgoing Secretary of State John Kerry just before Trump was inaugurated. Total food assistance since 1995 was about $700 million. George W. Bush in 2007-2008 provided about $150 million in fuel oil when engaged in negotiations.
