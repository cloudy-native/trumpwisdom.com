There was a gain of 10,000 \"factories\" -- technically “manufacturing establishments,\" 80 percent of them with five or less people -- in Obama's second term. The loss of 200,000 jobs depends on whether you start counting the start of the term in January or February. (A president takes office on Jan. 20, but the data is collected the week of the 12th.) Trump starts with January. But if you start counting in February, as many economists recommend, Obama over eight years actually had a modest gain in manufacturing jobs — 4,000.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"22550, 22196, 21308","repeated_count":"3","date":"08/11/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
