He's adding up the people caught trying to cross the border illegally (apprehensions) with the people who request asylum or show up legally at ports of entry (inadmisibles). Inadmisibles are not \"illegal immigrants\" because there is no illegality involved. If Trump used only the number of apprehensions, the total for fiscal 2018 would be 1,000 a day, or half what he claimed.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
