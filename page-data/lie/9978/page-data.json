And if you look at -- well, United States Steel has one, but you have many steel companies, they're adding plants all over the country, or they're expanding plants.”","analysis":"U.S. Steel made no such announcement. It merely stated that it would restart two blast furnaces at the company’s Granite City Works integrated plant in Illinois — one in March 2018 and the other in October 2018 for a total of 800 jobs. The company in August 2018 also said it would upgrade a plant in Gary, Ind., but without creating any new jobs. Regardless, neither of those announcements are new plants. Although some investments have been announced by other steel manufacturers, the steel industry was not going out of business, as Trump suggests. Big integrated steel mills had trouble competing with more nimble and efficient mini-mills.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"12292, 9978, 8573, 6793, 6773, 7062, 6578, 6280, 5877, 5401, 5587, 5386, 5265, 5709, 4792, 4848, 4707, 4603, 4710, 4487, 4652, 4315, 4550, 4293, 4515, 4234, 3711, 3717, 3767, 4081, 3593, 3833, 3560, 4061, 3559, 3989, 4019, 4028, 3553, 3493","repeated_count":"40","date":"04/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
