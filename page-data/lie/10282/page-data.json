Arms Trade Treaty. And in his waning days in office, he sent the treaty to the Senate to begin the ratification process. This treaty threatened your subjugate — you know exactly what’s going on here — your rights, your constitutional and international rules and restrictions and regulations. Under my administration, we will never surrender American sovereignty to anyone. We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to trample on your Second Amendment freedom.”","analysis":"The 2014 Arms Trade Treaty regulates international sales of conventional weapons, such as tanks and combat vehicles, but also firearms. It does not “surrender American sovereignty” over gun laws to the United Nations or hand enforcement powers over guns to “foreign bureaucrats. But the National Rifle Association was fiercely opposed, claiming that export/import controls would eventually amount to gun registration. Experts disagree.
