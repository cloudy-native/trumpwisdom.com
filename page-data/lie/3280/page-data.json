If you read his statement it was a foolish statement there was a lot of bravado … but it does not .. plenty of other politicians have said a lot worse. And it doesn’t, he shouldn’t have been put in jail.”","analysis":"Trump plays down serious charges against former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was sentenced to 14 years for public corruption. Blagojevich had been under investigation for corrupt activity for several years when he was recorded on a phone call discussing the prospect of filling the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama when Obama was elected president. \"I've got this thing, and it's f**king golden,\" Blagojevich said. \"I'm just not giving it up for f**king nothing....It's a f**king valuable thing, you just don't give it away for nothing...If I don't get what I want ... I'll just take the Senate seat myself.\" He allegedly sought such items as a substantial salary at a foundation, a well-paying job for his wife or a cabinet post or ambassadorship. He was found guilty of 11 counts related to the Senate seat and 6 counts related to fundraising extortion of a hospital executive. Four convictions were later overturned by an appeals court, but the judge refused to reduce the sentence.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/31/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
