But I will say this … whether he did or whether he didn't, he denies it vehemently. His father denies it -- the king -- vehemently. The CIA doesn't say they did it. They do point out certain things. And in pointing out those things, you can conclude that maybe he did or maybe he didn't. But there's no -- that was another part of the false reporting, because a lot of you said yesterday that they said he did it. Well, they didn't say that. They said he might have done it. That's a big difference. But they're vehemently denying it. And we have hundreds of thousands of jobs. Do people really want me to give up hundreds of thousands of jobs? And frankly, if we went by this standard, we wouldn't be able to have anybody as an ally. Because look at what happens all over the world.”","analysis":"The CIA has assessed with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-concludes-saudi-crown-prince-ordered-jamal-khashoggis-assassination/2018/11/16/98c89fe6-e9b2-11e8-a939-9469f1166f9d_story.html?utm_term=.047e2afdf75a\">high confidence</a> that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Trump's claim that hundreds of thousands of prospective jobs could be lost if the Saudis cancel business deals is false. Most of the promised jobs would be in Saudi Arabia, not the United States, and that's only if these tentative deals Trump references end up materializing.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
