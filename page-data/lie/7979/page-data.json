We want children to be safe. The children are being decimated. And I'm not talking about necessarily children in our country. I'm talking about wonderful children that are coming up from other places, whether it's Honduras or Guatemala, or El Salvador or Mexico, or other places. And we have to take care of those children also. We can't let them die on the way up.”","analysis":"Children face hazardous conditions on the journey from Central America to the U.S. border, and there have been two recent deaths of young immigrant children in U.S. custody. However, Trump's visceral language about children being \"decimated\" or dying on the journey north does not reflect conditions on the ground. It's also important to keep in mind that many immigrants are families fleeing violence in Central America or seeking economic opportunity in the United States and would rather risk the journey than stay in their home countries.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8821, 8567, 8592, 8487, 8487, 8495, 8504, 8505, 8382, 8292, 8274, 7803, 8010, 8007, 8130, 7794, 8189, 8202, 8229, 8246, 8246, 8250, 7762, 7762, 8004, 8077, 8092, 7970, 7971, 7979, 7980, 7999, 8209, 8219, 7960, 7880, 7861","repeated_count":"37","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
