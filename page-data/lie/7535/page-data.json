Many of those people are criminals, okay? And have been so adjudged. We know who they are. They have records. They have, some, very substantial criminal records, some very bad criminal records. They're in the caravan. … But, you know, you're dealing with a minimum of 500 serious criminals.”","analysis":"Democrats do not want open borders or illegal immigration. Any crowd of 7,000 people is going to have some bad apples. Mexican officials have already identified several and deported them, so they are no longer a potential threat. Trump's figure of 500 people is based on a fuzzy news release to justify presidential assertions, and officials refused to explain how the numbers were calculated. Still, numbers issued by DHS — 270 to 470 — are roughly consistent with the percentage of people with criminal pasts — 5 percent — in the 2014 surge. So it may not be completely out of line even if the possible criminality is hyped.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"11421, 8827, 8600, 8641, 8329, 7719, 7732, 7703, 7577, 7578, 7327, 7331, 7515, 7546, 7521, 7522, 7535, 7506, 6728, 6958, 6982, 7102, 7105, 7106, 7149, 6798, 6817, 6515, 6605, 6748, 6752, 6753, 7031, 7032, 7034, 7075, 7087, 7093, 6534, 6536, 6548, 6549, 6558, 6630, 6652, 6653, 6268, 6269, 6293, 6231, 5984, 6011, 6187, 6196, 6197, 5202, 6334, 6340, 6354, 6355, 6135, 6137, 6159, 6422, 6455, 6456, 6457, 6458, 6468, 5458, 5461, 5489, 5491","repeated_count":"73","date":"11/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
