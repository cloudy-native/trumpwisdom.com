Only eight former Gitmo detainees \"confirmed of reengaging\" in terrorist or insurgent activities were released under Obama, and 113 were released under George W. Bush. Trump first tweeted this at 7:04 a.m. on the @realDonaldTrump account, and it was immediately called out as false on Twitter. But then at 8:03 a.m., he repeated the same tweet on the @POTUS account. Therefore, we are counting the two tweets as separate entries in our database.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"0214","repeated_count":"1","date":"03/07/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
