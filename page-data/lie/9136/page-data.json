When I ran for president, my first speech, I mention the word rape. The press went after me. I couldn't believe it. …  If you look at that speech, that was so innocent compared to what's really happening. That was a very innocent speech compared to the real facts.”","analysis":"It's undeniable that there is a pattern of women suffering sexual abuse on the journey north, but it's hard to quantify. This 1-in-3 statistic comes from Doctors Without Borders, which interviewed 56 women for a report in 2017 and found that 31.4 percent were “sexually abused” on the journey; 10.7 percent were raped. But the figure was not based on a random sample and thus is not representative of the entire migrant population traveling through Mexico.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"13218, 11483, 9324, 9263, 9136, 8790, 8743, 8619, 8303, 8304, 8305","repeated_count":"11","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
