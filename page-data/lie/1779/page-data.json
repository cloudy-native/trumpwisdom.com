As you know, we’ve been saying $2.5 trillion for years.  Well, that number has greatly expanded.  And we’ll be bringing back an excess of $4 trillion.”","analysis":"Trump keeps inflating the amount of money held overseas by U.S. companies. Just last month he estimated there was $3 trillion, and here he says \"an excess of $4 trillion,\" suggesting his numbers are fabrications. There are no official, current numbers on the profits held overseas by U.S. companies, just estimates. The White House would not respond to a query on where Trump is getting these numbers, but his high-end figure appears to be an exaggeration. The Internal Revenue Service in 2012 said the figure was $2.3 trillion, and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it had risen to $2.6 trillion in 2015. There are other estimates as well, but none top $2.8 trillion.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/06/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
