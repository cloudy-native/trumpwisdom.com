News and polling organizations do not publish fake polls or “suppression polls,” which in Trump’s parlance are polls that relay false information to demoralize and dissuade people from voting.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
