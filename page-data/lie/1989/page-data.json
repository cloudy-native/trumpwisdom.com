All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their 'pockets.'”","analysis":"Trump was a fierce critic of the international agreement on limiting Iran’s nuclear ambitions, led by the Obama administration, although he has not yet terminated American participation. But in commenting on the unrest in Iran, Trump goes too far to claim “all of the money” went to terrorism or to line politicians’ pockets. Concurrent with the negotiations, the United States settled a dispute over undelivered weapons systems purchased by the deposed shah for $1.7 billion, most of which was accrued interest. That was delivered in cash, and the Congressional Research Service <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS20871.pdf\">in a recent report</a> says “most of the $1.7 billion” was used “to augment its 2017 defense budget, although it is not clear how much, if any, of these funds might have contributed to Iran’s regional activities versus other programs.” The nuclear agreement also unlocked an estimated $115 billion of Iranian funds that were trapped overseas. But at least $60 billion was already owed to creditors.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30974, 29451, 29546, 29686, 29966, 30132, 29047, 28669, 28463, 28213, 28805, 28997, 28083, 28174, 28342, 28001, 27685, 27870, 28237, 26841, 27149, 27327, 27516, 26382, 26470, 26219, 26124, 25702, 25575, 25525, 25328, 25392, 26577, 25918, 25123, 25057, 24935, 24754, 24861, 24736, 24640, 24389, 24326, 24197, 24100, 23907, 23797, 23854, 23667, 23487, 23272, 23066, 22005, 22380, 21635, 21566, 22477, 22986, 22991, 22125, 21499, 21423, 20535, 20099, 20043, 19496, 18092, 17760, 16509, 16410, 16639, 16123, 16124, 16165, 16396, 16077, 16079, 14159, 14444, 15222, 13600, 12704, 13123, 13255, 12397, 11615, 12201, 11404, 11317, 11973, 11312, 11947, 11445, 11883, 11244, 11878, 11295, 11210, 11742, 11123, 10826, 10271, 9901, 9722, 8583, 7944, 7562, 7277, 6837, 6124, 6325, 5324, 5533, 5833, 5777, 5728, 4974, 4723, 3351, 3079, 3112, 3016, 2983, 2924, 2903, 2908, 2721, 2375, 2089, 1989, 1471, 1394, 1015, 0896, 0061, 0046","repeated_count":"136","date":"01/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
