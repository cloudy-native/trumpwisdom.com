Got it done. And we got it built, Mr. Congressman, uh. We got it built too. They wanted two billion dollars to build it. I said maybe we can do cheaper. I said, to my people, I said, you know the story. Find something, maybe we owned some land. We did. It had a building on it. So we were gonna spend two billion dollars, I said, well, let's renovate the existing building. Is it big enough? Oh, it's too big actually. And how's the location? Much better than the one we were gonna buy in Jerusalem. I said, I'll come back with a price. David Friedman, he was one of the most successful lawyers. Now, he's the ambassador to Israel. So he calls me up two days later, he says, sir, I think we can do it for $350,000. I said, David, so from two billion? I said, well what's the difference between the two billion version and the one, 350,000? He said, 'Sir, honestly, the 350 will have a better location. A better building. It's actually better.'  Now who would believe stories like this, huh? And I actually told him, I did something, I think congressman, I've ever done in my life. I said, 'David, it's too cheap. It doesn't sound good. Make it more expensive please. So he made it 500,000. Not bad, right?”","analysis":"The new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem for about $400,000. (Trump sometimes claims it cost $500,000.) U.S. government documents <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/67072609\">show</a> the overall cost for the conversion now totals more than $23 million. Costs for the permanent embassy could well surpass $1 billion when all is said and done.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"10/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
