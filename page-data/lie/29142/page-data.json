They were only defective in one way. They didn't have the name Trump on it. In other words, if you wanted to vote for Trump what do you do? I guess you're supposed to write it out? Then they'll say, 'You can't do that.' No, it's a crooked deal. It's a crooked deal.”","analysis":"Trump falsely claimed that about 2,000 ballots were printed in California without his name on it. Instead the ballots were missing the entire presidential race, so not only Trump's name but Joe Biden's name and the names of other candidates were also missing.The ballots were sent to a single precinct in Los Angeles and the faulty ballots were quickly replaced.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"29142, 28570, 27169, 27457, 26358, 25185, 25595","repeated_count":"7","date":"10/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
