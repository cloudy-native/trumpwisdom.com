South Korea is transitioning away from nuclear power, Japan is making up for lost energy capacity after the Fukushima disaster, and two big Asian coal suppliers -- Australia and Indonesia -- had supply disruptions that led buyers to the U.S., the EIA found. Also, \"clean coal\" is a myth. It is rhetoric often used to describe carbon capture and storage, a technique to capture carbon emissions from power plants, transport it through pipelines and inject it deep into the ground to make oil wells more productive. This technology has been developing in the U.S. since 2015 but it remains expensive and not viable economically without being linked to an enhanced oil recovery project.
