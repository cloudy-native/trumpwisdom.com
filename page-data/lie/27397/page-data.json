Incredible company. They don't like the Democrat governor. They don't want to spend the money. They would have come and spent a lot of money. They don't like the possibility that a sleepy Joe could get in. They don't want to invest billions of dollars and having those policies. So, they pull back. If Trump gets in, they will spend billions and billions and billions. Not your state, but Wisconsin, probably your state too, billions of dollars. But we speak to them. They're unhappy when they see this Democrat kind of leadership or even the chance that it is. So, where do you see what Foxconn does in Wisconsin?”","analysis":"This appears to be mostly an invented story, designed to suggest Democrats turn off companies and a Trump victory will win more investment. Trump heavily touted the Foxconn deal to build a hi-tech display factory in Wisconsin which was expected to generate 13,000 Wisconsin jobs. But there long were concerns in the state that the incentive deal was too costly. Foxconn was offered a combination of tax-breaks, infrastructure improvements and other incentives worth up to $4 billion on the basis of direct and indirect Wisconsin jobs expected to be created by the factory. But progress was slow and Foxconn suggest it wanted to scale back its plans. Gov. Tony Evers stated in 2019 that ‘the present contract deals with a situation that no longer exists’ and that renegotiation was needed to protect taxpayers. The company missed its first-year hiring target by a wide margin, ending 2018 with just 178 full-time employees. And rather than the promised large-sized display panels, it began churning out face masks and ventilators after the pandemic struck. But in November, 2020, after Trump made these remarks, the company <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/foxconn-plant-championed-by-trump-lands-google-server-contract\">landed a contract</a> to assemble key components for Google servers.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
