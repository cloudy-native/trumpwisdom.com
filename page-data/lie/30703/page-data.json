These are the people that need it. This will save patients up to 30 percent. It could be 40 percent, could be 50 percent, could be much higher than that.”","analysis":"Trump oversells the possible impact of a new rule that bans drug rebates in the Medicare program. This rule is hated by pharmacy middlemen who collect the rebates but often don't pass on the savings to consumers. The rebates are part of an opaque and convoluted price negotiation system, in which consumers can find it impossible to discover the actual price of a drug, let alone shop around for the best value. Like the “most favored nation” policy, the aim of the rebates ban is to ultimately lower drug prices. But the administration abandoned that effort last year, when its own analysis showed such a ban would actually raise premiums in Medicare. That’s because health insurers, who increasingly own pharmacy benefit managers, probably would hike premiums to cover some of their losses from lost drug rebates.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
