There is no reason for this, and things are being set in motion to have this number come WAY DOWN.”","analysis":"President Trump at various times has estimated that illegal immigration annually costs the United States $100 billion, $200 billion, even $275 billion. Trump appears to be relying on a partisan study that came up with an estimate of $135 billion, but has been criticized for its methodology, which critics say overstates costs and understates benefits. Other analysts say the cost of illegal immigration is much lower, if anything – and over time may even result in the net gain for the United States. Over 75 years, each immigrant represents $259,000 in net present value for federal, state and local governments, according to a 2016 report by National Academies on the economic impact of the U.S. immigration system.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31494, 16480, 12997, 8455, 8358, 8037, 7887, 7925, 7658, 7668, 7645, 7271, 7285, 7566, 7264, 6699, 6782, 6932, 6965, 7118, 7155, 6809, 6600, 6765, 7072","repeated_count":"25","date":"09/13/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
