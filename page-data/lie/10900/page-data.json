That's going to do a great job with that beautiful plant, and that happened just a little while ago, just a little while ago. They'll be spending a lot of money on fixing it up. It's subject to the UAW. They've got to get out there make a deal. UAW, come on, got to make a deal. But that's a great thing, right? Because that was the only thing they could hit me with. They couldn't have been happy with anything, because we've been so good, but this is -- what about Lordstown? What about Lordstown? I call up Mary Barra, 'Will you make a deal or open it, please. I'm getting killed with that plant.' Anyway, today she called, they're going to be opening, it's going to be a great company going there, it is really wonderful. And another historic action.”","analysis":"GM has only said it is in discussions to sell the Lordstown complex to Workhorse, but no deal had been concluded at the time held this rally.
