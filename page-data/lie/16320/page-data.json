He’s on tape saying that he’s holding back $1 billion from Ukraine unless you change the prosecutor.”","analysis":"Trump falsely accuses Biden of something he did not do. The Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office had opened an investigation into a Ukrainian oligarch, Mykola Zlochevsky, who owned Burisma Holdings, a natural gas company. Hunter Biden, the vice president’s son, joined Burisma’s board in April 2014 and left in 2019. The prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, let the investigation go dormant, as well as other investigations, and the United States and its allies decided he was not effective in his job and in fact let corruption flourish. Biden traveled to Ukraine in December 2015 and said the United States would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees unless Shokin was removed; it was not a demand to stop the Burisma prosecution and there’s no evidence Shokin was after Hunter Biden or that he was ever under investigation. The vice president’s trip was part of a longer push by the United States, Western allies and nongovernmental organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The goal was to promote reform in Ukraine and remove a prosecutor who allegedly was turning a blind eye to corruption. The U.S. plan to push for Shokin’s dismissal didn’t emanate from Biden, but rather from officials at the State Department. Shokin was eventually removed by parliament. The prosecutor general of Ukraine in early 2019, Yuri Lutsenko, was quoted as saying “he had no evidence of wrongdoing by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden or his son.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"29789, 29878, 30018, 30154, 30205, 30206, 30266, 30490, 29212, 29286, 29342, 29411, 29460, 29663, 29504, 29941, 29985, 28705, 28961, 29119, 29159, 29166, 28659, 28423, 28474, 28480, 28542, 28591, 28595, 28503, 28508, 28728, 28971, 29029, 28067, 28320, 27945, 27562, 27700, 27856, 27619, 27643, 27748, 28197, 27003, 27038, 27054, 26810, 26640, 26686, 27074, 27262, 27265, 27421, 26888, 26889, 26892, 26893, 26894, 26924, 26884, 27287, 27464, 26331, 26410, 26414, 26508, 26181, 26235, 25756, 25763, 26402, 25639, 19771, 16320, 14927, 14842, 14731, 14543, 15275, 14179, 14622, 13906, 13804, 13834, 13086, 13067, 13068, 13061, 13040, 13212, 13491, 13498, 12911, 12895, 12896, 13385, 13403, 13419","repeated_count":"99","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
