The Radical Left Democrats, working closely with their beloved partner, the Fake News Media, is using every trick in the book to SILENCE a majority of our Country. They have all out campaigns against @FoxNews hosts who are doing too well. Fox must stay strong and fight back with vigor. Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down, and continue to fight for our Country. The losers all want what you have, don't give it to them. Be strong & prosper, be weak & die! Stay true to the people that got you there. Keep fighting for Tucker, and fight hard for @JudgeJeanine. Your competitors are jealous - they all want what you've got - NUMBER ONE. Don't hand it to them on a silver platter. They can't beat you, you can only beat yourselves!”","analysis":"Pirro's show was suspended by Fox News, without any announcement, after the host knocked Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.): \"Think about it: Omar wears a hijab. Is her adherence to this Islamic doctrine indicative of her adherence to Sharia law, which in itself is antithetical to the United States Constitution?\" The network issued a statement saying \"we strongly condemn Jeanine Pirro's comments.\" Trump is wrong to suggest her comments represent a majority of the country. Polling by the Pew Research Center <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2017/07/26/how-the-u-s-general-public-views-muslims-and-islam/\">indicates</a> that Americans are split on whether there is a natural conflict between Islam and Democracy, though more say there is no conflict. Majorities of Americans also reject the idea that Muslims are extremists or are anti-American. However, Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP, especially white evangelical Protestants who are the core of Trump's base, tend to hold much more negative views about Muslims and Islam than do Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
