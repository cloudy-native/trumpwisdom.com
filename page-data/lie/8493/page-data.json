But TRAC says the number is actually near 1.1 million because the Trump administration recently removed 330,211 previously completed cases and put them back on the “pending” rolls, not because the \"laws were obsolete.\" So essentially the caseload has doubled during the Trump administration.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
