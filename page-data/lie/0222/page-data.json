Premiums have skyrocketed by double-digits and triple-digits in some cases.

As bad as it is now, it’ll get even worse.”","analysis":"Trump cherry-picks data from Arizona, the state hit the hardest by 2017 premium increases under the Affordable Care Act. The average increase for the second-lowest-cost silver plan (which is used as the benchmark to calculate government subsidies) is 25 percent. A few states, such as Indiana, actually saw a decrease.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"0273, 0252, 0239, 0225, 0164, 0122","repeated_count":"6","date":"03/10/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
