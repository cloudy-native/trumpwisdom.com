We were the big, dumb piggy bank. And everybody was robbing us blind, the whole world. The United States had racked up $13 trillion in trade deficits since 1994. Think of that, $13 trillion.”","analysis":"Trump continues to mistakenly believe that trade deficits cause a country to \"lose\" money, when in fact that is wrong. A trade deficit means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Chinese goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce the purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would “gain” money that had been lost.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
