He was a total disaster because he basically let it happen -- unknowingly, because he's not very smart. But they let it happen.”","analysis":"Jeff Sessions, Trump's first pick to serve as attorney general, recused himself from the Russia investigation after career ethics officials in the Justice Department determined he had a conflict of interest -- the investigation was into Trump's campaign, and Sessions had served as a senior campaign adviser. Trump blames Sessions's decision to recuse himself for the ensuing appointment of a special counsel and a series of criminal convictions and damning revelations related to his campaign's dealings with Russia, but Sessions is on pretty solid ground in arguing that he had no choice but to recuse. Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey and his statement to NBC's Lester Holt that the firing was due to the ongoing Russia investigation were the catalysts for the special counsel's investigation -- Sessions's recusal had nothing to do with either.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
