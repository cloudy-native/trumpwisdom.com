It has been powerful leverage, so powerful that companies generally do whatever we are asking, without even a formal notice. They know something is coming, and that's all they need to know.”","analysis":"A shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment for health-care workers (masks, gowns, gloves and the like) has caused consternation among local leaders and medical professionals. Because supplies are limited, states have had to compete and outbid each other for what’s available on the market. One way to short-circuit the problem, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and others, is for Trump to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up manufacturing of these supplies and allocate them to the places that need them. Trump has been reluctant to use his full powers under the law.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
