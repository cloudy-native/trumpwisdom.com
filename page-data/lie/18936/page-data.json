I can give the Committee a very comprehensive list. When will the Noble Committee DEMAND the Prizes back, especially since they were gotten under fraud? The reporters and Lamestream Media knew the truth all along Lawsuits should be brought against all, including the Fake News Organizations, to rectify this terrible injustice. For all of the great lawyers out there, do we have any takers? When will the Noble Committee Act? Better be fast!”","analysis":"Trump is referring to reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/staffs-new-york-times-and-washington-post\">who won</a> a shared Pulitzer Prize (not a Nobel Prize) for their reporting on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
