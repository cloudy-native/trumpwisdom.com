And I was shocked because I know Joe, and he's tough. A tough guy. And I was really surprised to hear he was going to quit. Before I could even either talk to him or talk to anybody else, he put out a statement -- I didn't speak to Joe yet -- but he said, ‘At no time have I considered resigning my position.’ In other words, the story in the Washington Post was a fake.”","analysis":"The Washington Post's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/acting-director-of-national-intelligence-threatened-to-resign-if-he-couldnt-speak-freely-before-congress/2019/09/25/b1deb71e-dfbf-11e9-be96-6adb81821e90_story.html\">report</a> was based on information from \"current and former U.S. officials familiar with the matter.\" Maguire and the White House denied that he threatened to resign. After those statements were issued, Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron said, “We stand by the story.” The Post further reported, \"The current and former officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter, said Maguire had pushed the White House to make an explicit legal decision on whether it would assert executive privilege over the whistleblower complaint, which centers on a call that Trump made with the leader of Ukraine in late July.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
