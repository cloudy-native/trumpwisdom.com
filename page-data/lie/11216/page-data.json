And we have done much more than most administrations. And it does -- it’s not -- really not talked about very much, but we've done, actually, a lot.”","analysis":"Trump has not \"done more than most administration\" on guns. He did sign into law the Fix NICS Act, aimed at improving the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and the administration issued a regulation that banned bump stocks -- devices that can be attached to the rear of a semiautomatic rifle to make it shoot almost as fast as a fully automatic weapon. There has also been an increase in prosecuting firearms offenses. But Trump has resisted congressional efforts to impose universal background checks and his administration has taken steps to weaken gun regulations. He is a fervent supporter of the National Rifle Association, which has long resisted new gun-control laws.
