I think our farmers are going to be extremely happy. It was very limited as to what they could do and what they could send. And now it's a open market, and they're going to be sending a lot more farm products...South Korea will double the annual number of American cars sold within. In other words, we used to sell a maximum of 25, and we wouldn't even get to that number, and now we're going to 50,000. We're doubling it, per manufacturer. And that's a doubling. So it's 50,000 per manufacturer -- cars. And that's each year.”","analysis":"Under the previous trade deal with South America, auto manufacturers could sell 25,000 not 25 cars per year.
