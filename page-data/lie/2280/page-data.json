This is an American disgrace!”","analysis":"The memo written by the majority staff of the House Intelligence Committee did not vindicate the president. The FBI said it has serious errors and even Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), the only Republican member who reviewed the underlying documents, said: \"I actually don't think [the memo] has any impact on the Russia probe.\" As for the \"witch hunt,\" investigations into the Trump campaign's contacts with Russians continue. The intelligence community has confirmed Russian meddling in the U.S. election.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/03/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
