Gary wrote a check for 200 [million dollars]”","analysis":"Cohn, the director of the National Economic Council, sold about $220 million in Goldman Sachs stock before joining the administration. He also received a $65 million payment that was tied to future performance. Given that the capital gains tax rate is capped at 20 percent, there is no way Cohn paid $200 million in tax on a $285 million payout, particularly because he can defer capital gains if the proceeds are invested in approved securities such as Treasury bonds.
