Southwest border apprehensions peaked most recently at 1.6 million in 2000 and have been in decline for the better part of the following two decades, partly because of technology upgrades, tougher penalties post-9/11, a decline in migration rates from Mexico and a sharp rise in the number of Border Patrol officers. From 2000 to 2016, annual apprehensions declined from 1.6 million to 408,870, a 75 percent drop. For fiscal 2017, Customs and Border Protection reported 303,916 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border, the lowest in more than 45 years. But then the figure climbed to 396,579 in fiscal 2018.
