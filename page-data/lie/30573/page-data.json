More & more people are stepping forward to expose this Rigged Election!”","analysis":"Richard Hopkins, a Pennsylvania postal worker who signed a sworn affidavit alleging that a supervisor ordered colleagues to backdate ballots received after Election Day, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/politics/2020/11/11/house-panel-says-pa--postal-worker-recanted-election-fraud-claim--but-whistleblower-insists-he-hasn-t\">disavowed</a> his claims after he was interviewed by the U.S. Postal Service’s Office of Inspector General. Hopkins first made the allegation anonymously in a video with James O'Keefe, founder of the conservative activist organization Project Veritas. Hopkins provided no evidence to support his allegation beyond repeating a conversation he claimed to have overheard. Trump here tweets a video in which Hopkins changed his mind again and denied that he had recanted his story. But his allegations were never proven.

A bulk of the ballots were processed at various locations across the state and the country, from places as far west as Tacoma, Washington, and as far south as Florida. Most were postmarked in Pittsburgh. The voters are registered in Erie County, but likely are out of the area for work, college or travel, Anderson said.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
