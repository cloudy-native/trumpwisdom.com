(In 1992 and 1996, Texan Ross Perot ran as an independent and took votes away from the Republicans.) We're not sure what \"border towns\" Trump is referring to but Trump did make gains among Hispanics in Texas. Biden carried the South Texas border counties by only 11 points, compared to Hillary Clinton's 44-point spread in 2016. Trump in 2016 had lost all 18 Texas counties where Latinos make up at least 80% of the population, but in 2020 he won five of them and closed the gap considerably in the rest.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/12/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
