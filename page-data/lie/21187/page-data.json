According to our friends at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/does-it-take-10-years-get-permit-build-road-donald/\">Politifact</a>, recent government studies say the permit approval time ranges from 4.6 to 6.6 years. The only study that claims a 10-year approval is common comes from a pro-deregulation group, which raises questions about its reliability. This still falls short of Trump's 21 year claim.
