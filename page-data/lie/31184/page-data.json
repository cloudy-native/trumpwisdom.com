We were so restricted, we couldn't breathe in this country, that's one of the big -- I think it might've been more important in many ways than the tax cuts.”","analysis":"Trump may have grounds to brag about his efforts to peel back regulations, but his claim of the most or biggest regulation cuts cannot be easily verified and appears to be false. There is no reliable metric on which to judge this claim — or to compare him to previous presidents. Many experts say the most significant regulatory changes in U.S. history were the deregulation of airline, rail and trucking industries during the Carter administration, which are estimated to provide consumers with $70 billion in annual benefits. A detailed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/11017-coglianesesarinshapirotrumpderegulationreport11012\">November 2020 report</a> by the Penn Program on Regulation concluded that \"without exception, each major claim we have uncovered by the President or other White House official about regulation turns out to be exaggerated, misleading, or downright untrue.\" The report said that Trump Administration had not reduced the overall number of pages from the regulatory code book, and it completed far more regulatory actions than deregulatory ones once the full data are examined.
