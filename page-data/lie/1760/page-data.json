And if we didn't have the hurricanes, we could have hit four last quarter. Four -- a number that was unthinkable two years ago when I started the campaign, and even my first month in office -- that was an unthinkable number. And I’ll tell you what, it’s going to go higher than that.”","analysis":"Trump routinely touts quarterly GDP growth of 3 percent, suggesting the figure was unheard of being he took office. But GDP growth has routinely topped 3 percent on a quarterly basis. Most recently, GDP growth hit 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2015 while Obama was still in office. Trump has pledged 4 percent annual growth, which most economists think is unlikely.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"6685, 5020, 4891, 4632, 4416, 4166, 3854, 2196, 2012, 1760, 1841, 1692, 1429, 1508, 1519, 1388, 1462, 1312, 1173, 1257","repeated_count":"20","date":"12/13/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
