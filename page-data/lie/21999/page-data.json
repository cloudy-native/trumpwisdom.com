We've <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/15/trumps-claim-his-deregulatory-moves-are-saving-american-households-year/\">previously fact-checked</a> Trump's claim of giving households $3,000 a year in regulatory savings. By itself, it's a Three-Pinocchio claim. This is derived from a White House estimate that after five to 10 years, the administration's freeze on new regulations and rollback of Obama-era regulations will raise real incomes by $3,100 per household per year. The estimate depends on a lot of assumptions and some cherry-picking but a bigger problem is that Trump speaks as if this pile of money is already landing in a household's pocket. The president never mentions actions taken by the administration that have reduced household income. For instance, Federal Reserve Bank of New York officials <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/new-china-tariffs-increase-costs-to-us-households.html?mod=article_inlin\">peg</a> Trump's tariffs as already costing the typical U.S. household $831 a year. He frequently makes a comparison to numbers under George W. Bush and Barack Obama but those are apples-and-oranges comparisons.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"28798, 28980, 26439, 26247, 26167, 25851, 25037, 24606, 21999, 22928, 22187, 22832, 18464, 18070, 17029, 17501, 18257, 18286, 16834, 18195, 16743, 16715, 16532, 16113, 16183, 16325, 15426, 14935, 15713, 15746, 14563, 15847","repeated_count":"32","date":"08/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
