They’re pouring into our country. We have to have border security. We have to have a wall as part of border security. And I don't think we really disagree so much.”","analysis":"Generally speaking, fewer people are “pouring into our country.” The number of people apprehended crossing the southern border is a fraction of what it was in 2000. There’s no evidence those undocumented immigrants bring “tremendous medical difficulty.”\n\nThe World Health Organization found that, “in spite of the common perception of an association between migration and importation of infectious diseases, there is no systemic association.” Rather, there’s more risk of disease spreading from business travelers or tourists than migrants. This is, in part, because migrants at the southern border make up a small proportion of all the people entering the United States on a given day.\n\nPlus, any person seeking asylum in the United States undergoes a medical screening and examination to identify inadmissible health conditions. They also must meet U.S. immunization requirements before they apply for permanent U.S. residence.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/11/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
