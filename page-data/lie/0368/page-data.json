Anthony Kennedy, 80, was a Republican pick and so perhaps could be inspired to retire under Trump. Liberals Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 84,and Stephen Breyer, 78, presumably would need to die or become very ill before they leave the court under Trump. That adds up to four, but how does Trump \"more than that\"? Clarence Thomas is only 68 and Samuel Alito is 67, and the other justices are even younger.
