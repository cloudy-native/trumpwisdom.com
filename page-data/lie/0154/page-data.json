And then a day later, I said has anybody reported what's going on? And it turned out that they didn't -- not too many of them did. Take a look at what happened in Sweden.

Sweden has welcomed refugees and immigrants, but Swedish crime experts do not agree that the country's immigration policies are linked to crime. Just two days after Trump made his false claim, riots broke out in a predominantly immigrant neighborhood in Stockholm, the country’s capital. That neighborhood was the scene of riots in 2010 and 2013, stemming from anger directed at the influx of refugees and migrants into the country.
