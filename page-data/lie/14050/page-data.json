And I opened ANWR to oil and gas in Alaska. You know, the ANWR site is one of the biggest in the world and nobody could get it approved, including Ronald Reagan. They could not get it approved. I got it approved.”","analysis":"Based on the geology, the USGS projected that there could be anywhere from 5.7 billion to 16 billion barrels of oil (average = 10.4 billion barrels) in ANWR field. That does not even make it the biggest in Alaska. Its estimated oil reserves thus fall below Prudhoe Bay's 13.6 billion barrels, but are similar to the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska's (NPRA's) 10.6 billion barrels. The Ghawar field in Saudi Arabia, which has been producing oil since the 1950s, has 70 million barrels left in reserves.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"21316, 22658, 18662, 19137, 16375, 14050, 15100, 13285, 11559, 12050, 11872, 9972, 9100, 9051, 2709","repeated_count":"15","date":"10/23/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
