'First New Coal Mine of Trump Era Opens in Pennsylvania'”","analysis":"Trump takes credit for a new mine opening up, but the digging of this coal mine began two months before the presidential election. Moreover, these mines are for metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel. It's not relevant in the context of the Paris agreement, in which this claim was made, because the agreement has to do with carbon emissions from thermal coal, which produces heat and electricity.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"5283, 0739, 0689, 0658, 0645, 06340603 0634 0658 0882","repeated_count":"10","date":"06/12/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
