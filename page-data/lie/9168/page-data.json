It’s a total new love letter to 'Trump' and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction!”","analysis":"Cohen never wrote a manuscript, according to his spokesman. In early 2018, Cohen shopped a book proposal that was pitched as a positive account of Trump, but he apparently did not write anything. Cohen’s spokesman, Lanny Davis, said that Cohen was offered a “substantial advance” nearly a year ago “for a proposal regarding a book on understanding Donald Trump. Mr. Cohen ultimately elected not to proceed.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"8931, 9168, 9169, 9046, 9047, 9049","repeated_count":"6","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
