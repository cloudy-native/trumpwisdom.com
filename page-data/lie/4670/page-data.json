Maybe the largest trade deal ever made. And it's really something very special that two countries were able to come together and get it done.”","analysis":"Trump announced an informal trade agreement with Mexico to replace NAFTA. But he needs Congress to approve any change to NAFTA, and that hasn't happened. The U.S. is still negotiating with Canada. So it's inaccurate to say it's \"done.\" It is also wrong to call it one of the largest trade deals ever made. The Trans Pacific Partnership, which Trump withdrew from, represented 40 percent of the world's GDP and so was far larger.
