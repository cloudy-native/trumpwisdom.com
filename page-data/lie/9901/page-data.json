We gave $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash.”","analysis":"This was related to the settlement of a decades-old claim between the two countries. An initial payment of $400 million was handed over on Jan. 17, 2016, the day after Iran released four American detainees, including The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian. The timing — which U.S. officials insisted was a coincidence — suggested the cash could be viewed as a ransom payment. But the initial cash payment was Iran’s money. In the 1970s, the then-pro-Western Iranian government under the shah paid $400 million for U.S. military equipment. But the equipment was never delivered because the two countries broke off relations after the seizure of American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran. Two other payments totaling $1.3 billion — a negotiated agreement on the interest owed on the $400 million — came some weeks later.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30974, 29451, 29546, 29686, 29966, 30132, 29047, 28669, 28463, 28213, 28805, 28997, 28083, 28174, 28342, 28001, 27685, 27870, 28237, 26841, 27149, 27327, 27516, 26382, 26470, 26219, 26124, 25702, 25575, 25525, 25328, 25392, 26577, 25918, 25123, 25057, 24935, 24754, 24861, 24736, 24640, 24389, 24326, 24197, 24100, 23907, 23797, 23854, 23667, 23487, 23272, 23066, 22005, 22380, 21635, 21566, 22477, 22986, 22991, 22125, 21499, 21423, 20535, 20099, 20043, 19496, 18092, 17760, 16509, 16410, 16639, 16123, 16124, 16165, 16396, 16077, 16079, 14159, 14444, 15222, 13600, 12704, 13123, 13255, 12397, 11615, 12201, 11404, 11317, 11973, 11312, 11947, 11445, 11883, 11244, 11878, 11295, 11210, 11742, 11123, 10826, 10271, 9901, 9722, 8583, 7944, 7562, 7277, 6837, 6124, 6325, 5324, 5533, 5833, 5777, 5728, 4974, 4723, 3351, 3079, 3112, 3016, 2983, 2924, 2903, 2908, 2721, 2375, 2089, 1989, 1471, 1394, 1015, 0896, 0061, 0046","repeated_count":"136","date":"04/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
