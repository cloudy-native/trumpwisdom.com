It wasn’t that I was a supporter. I predicted it was going to happen, and I was right. And people laughed when I predicted it, and they won by about 2 points. And I was standing out on Turnberry, and we had a press conference, and people were screaming. That was the day before, if you remember.”","analysis":"Trump’s timeline is off. He said in March 2016, three months before the June 23 vote on whether Britain should remain part of the European Union, that he thinks “Britain will separate from the EU. I think that maybe it’s time, especially in light of what’s happened with the craziness that is going on with immigration, with people pouring in all over the place I think that Britain will end up separating from the EU.” He was less sure about it on June 22, the day before the vote: “I don't think anybody should listen to me because I haven't really focused on it very much.\" As for being at Turnberry, he was there the day after the vote, not the day before the vote.
