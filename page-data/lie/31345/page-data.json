The margin of difference in Wisconsin was less than 20,000 votes. Each one of these things alone wins us the state.”","analysis":"Even if this were true, it would not have affected the election results. The so-called eyewitness, Ethan Pease, a temporary employee of a subcontractor, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/12/05/fact-check-even-backdated-ballots-wouldnt-affect-wisconsin-results/3831736001/\">said</a> his account is based on two conversations he had with USPS workers while filling a delivery role around the election, regarding actions allegedly taken Nov. 4 and 5.. In other words, he did not directly observe this. But more to the point, absentee ballots had to be received by the time polls closed on Election Day (Nov. 3) to be counted, and all state election results were reported by the early morning hours of Nov. 4. So even if the ballots were backdated after Nov. 4, they still would not be counted.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/06/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
