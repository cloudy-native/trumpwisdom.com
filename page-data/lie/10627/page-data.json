It was ready to be put into action, the Trans-Pacific Partnership that would have destroyed the state of Pennsylvania. The TPP was a gift for the lobbyists and the donors, and the special interests in the foreign countries that have made a fortune hurting the American worker. The TPP would have been a catastrophe for the people of Scranton and Allentown and Pittsburgh. In my first week, I proudly withdrew the United States from further negotiations on that job killing disaster, which by the way, would have destroyed our auto business, would have destroyed it. Just like NAFTA, just like NAFTA was such a disaster. This would have been worse.”","analysis":"Many of the digital trade and labor provisions in Trump's proposed USMCA trade agreement with Canada and Mexico are lifted from the Trans Pacific Partnership, which Trump killed early in his term. Millions of manufacturing jobs and thousands of U.S. manufacturing establishments have disappeared since NAFTA took effect in 1994, but it's difficult to isolate how much of that was because of NAFTA and not other factors such as automation. The studies we reviewed indicate NAFTA had a modest effect on the U.S. economy. Auto industry representatives and independent analysts seem to agree the NAFTA dynamics have helped rather than hindered automakers with U.S. operations.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
