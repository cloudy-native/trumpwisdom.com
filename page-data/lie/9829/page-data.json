So unfair to the U.S. OUT OF CONTROL!”","analysis":"Trump is referring to a ruling by a U.S. District Court judge, not a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge. (The district court just happens to be in an area covered by the 9th Circuit.) The district court had ruled that the Trump administration could not continue a policy of sending migrants to Mexico seeking asylum to Mexico to await processing. But then a few days after this tweet, the 9th Circuit ruled the U.S. government can continue at least temporarily to send asylum seekers back to Mexico while the parties prepare to submit arguments on the government’s request for a longer stay.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
