Many of them. I mean, you look at New York: It's up 348 percent. Who ever heard of a number like that?”","analysis":"False. The rate of violent crime has fallen dramatically in New York when looking at the last 20 years, 10 years, or two years. Because the numbers are so low, any temporary spike from week to week or month to month could translate into eye-popping percentages such as \"348 percent.\" But using the percentage in those cases without more explanation would be misleading. Also, Trump is cherry-picking weekly or monthly data showing the increase in shootings or murders, rather than comprehensive data for all types of violent crimes or property crimes. In 2020, violent crime was relatively flat or declining in New York year-to-date when Trump made these remarks.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
