The envelopes were wrong. The names were wrong. Everything was wrong. So, they said, oh, that's OK. We will send out a new 100,000. OK, let's assume they get it right. What happens to the 100,000 that they sent out? They're going to be sent back by somebody.”","analysis":"This was undoubtedly a big mistake but it was “fixable.” As many as 100,000 ballots that were sent to New York City voters may have been faulty. The New York City Board of Elections acted swiftly to have the vendor responsible for the misprints send new ballots to every voter who might have been affected. The New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/nyregion/brooklyn-absentee-ballot.html\">reported</a> “Voters should only send in the new ballot. But if they send in both the old and new one, the second ballot will override the first, election officials said. The second ballots will be distinguished by a red mark that will be picked up by the board’s ballot-processing machines, according to Frederic M. Umane, one of the city’s elections commissioners.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
