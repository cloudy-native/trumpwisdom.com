Think of this, the first five months of the Obama-Biden recovery, 23 times. We cut unemployment rate in half. Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half the jobs lost in the crisis. We did it in five months.”","analysis":"This is apples-and-oranges comparison. The Great Recession was caused by a meltdown in the financial industry, making it one of the more difficult types of recessions to rebuild from. The pandemic recession temporarily suspended millions of jobs, but the financial system remained relatively strong. In fact, as Trump often noted, the stock market quickly recovered. The risk is that if the pandemic lingers, economic growth may be hampered again. So it's too soon for Trump to make these comparisons.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"28618, 26203, 26154, 25691","repeated_count":"4","date":"10/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
