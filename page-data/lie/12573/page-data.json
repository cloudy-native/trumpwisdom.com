I barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself, bad on TV. Abused staff, got fired. Wrote a very nice book about me just recently. Now the book is a lie? Said his wife was driving him crazy, 'something big' was happening with her. Getting divorced. He was a mental wreck. We didn't want him around. Now Fake News puts him on like he was my buddy!”","analysis":"Trump does not explain why he hired Scaramucci to be his communications director if he was such an incompetent fool.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
