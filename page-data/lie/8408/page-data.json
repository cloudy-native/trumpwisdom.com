VA choice, VA accountability — you know, these are things that for decades and decades and I got a lot of these things. ”","analysis":"Trump constantly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/23/trump-obama-veterans-choice-act/?arc404=true\">pretends he passed the VA Choice bill</a>, in what The Washington Post called a \"false sense of accomplishment.\" Trump actually signed the MISSION Act, which was only a modest update of the VA Choice law passed by Obama in 2014. So it's ridiculous for him to often claim that it took 40 years to pass the law -- and for him to suggest Obama failed to act to help veterans. (Sometimes Trump says 44, 45 or even 48 years.) Despite Trump’s claims, it's not clear that veterans are facing shorter wait times. The MISSION Act only took effect in 2019, but before its implementation Trump often acted as if it already had achieved results.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"31617, 31309, 30972, 30342, 29543, 29715, 29961, 29045, 27736, 28210, 25350, 25142, 25017, 24816, 24647, 23852, 23686, 23558, 23571, 23271, 22359, 21001, 22925, 22182, 21884, 21319, 22830, 21230, 21489, 21404, 21451, 22600, 20588, 20518, 20417, 20019, 19986, 20312, 18907, 18764, 17705, 17620, 18419, 17847, 17155, 16853, 16148, 16003, 15873, 14787, 14882, 15558, 13925, 13455, 12737, 12738, 12701, 12541, 12542, 12430, 11236, 11748, 10892, 9800, 9832, 9529, 9455, 9361, 9157, 8729, 8644, 8408, 7816, 7368, 7189, 7215, 6941, 6977, 6834, 6919, 7066, 6649, 6312, 6009, 6405, 6151, 6503, 5917, 5611, 5376, 5544, 5830, 5231, 5787, 5169, 5082, 5133, 5677, 5645, 4915, 4721, 4451, 4623, 4651, 4558, 4294, 4248, 4174, 4096, 4066, 4004, 3534, 3389, 1208, 1092, 1093, 1087, 1002, 0968","repeated_count":"119","date":"01/30/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
