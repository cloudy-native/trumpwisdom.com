His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!”","analysis":"Trump and Cohen each say the other is lying, and it's not clear who's telling the truth. But it's inaccurate to say Cohen's lawyers \"totally contradicted him\" on the issue of whether Cohen sought a pardon from Trump. Here's the statement from Cohen attorney Lanny Davis: \"Prior to Michael Cohen's decision to leave the 'Joint Defense Group' and tell the truth on July 2, 2018 Michael was open to the ongoing 'dangling' of a possible pardon by Trump representatives privately and in the media. During that time period, he directed his attorney to explore possibilities of a pardon at one point with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani as well as other lawyers advising President Trump. But after July 2, 2018, Mr. Cohen authorized me as a new lawyer to say publicly Mr. Cohen would never accept a pardon from President Trump even if offered. That continues to be the case. And his statement at the Oversight Hearing was true — and consistent with his post joint defense agreement commitment to tell the truth.\"","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"9222, 9205, 8144, 7753, 7626, 7595, 7596, 7597, 7599, 7600, 7603, 7618, 7619, 7592, 7265, 7296","repeated_count":"16","date":"03/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
