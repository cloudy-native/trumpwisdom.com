Sanctuary cities. Every day, sanctuary cities are unleashing vicious predators and bloodthirsty killers, like MS-13, into our communities. They go out and they hide out in sanctuary cities.”","analysis":"This dystopian vision of a violent gang overrunning cities and towns across the U.S. is divorced from reality. MS-13 operates in a few areas such as Los Angeles, Long Island and the D.C. region. The sanctuary policies Democrats tend to support limit the kinds of cooperation state and local law enforcement agencies and jails can provide to federal immigration officials. These policies do not relax any criminal laws, penalties or processes. Sanctuary policies mostly shield undocumented immigrants who are detained for minor offenses such as traffic stops from being referred to ICE for deportation. Those who commit serious crimes such as murder do not benefit from sanctuary policies.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
