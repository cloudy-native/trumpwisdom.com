You know, I could've been a much bigger fundraiser than him, but I didn't want to call every head of a Wall Street firm, every head of the oil companies that we've made rich anyway....The failed establishment that started the disasters far and worse, they support Sleepy Joe Biden, 'cause they get anything they want. And he took in $300 million last month. You think he made any deals? No, I don't think so. The career politicians that offshored your industries, and decimated your factories, they support Sleepy Joe.”","analysis":"Without evidence, Trump suggests Biden is guilty of corruption because he is raising so much more money than the president. But Biden gathered a lot of donations from small donors too. \"Biden ultimately beat out Trump with both large donors and smaller contributors giving $200 or less,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/11/biden-wins/\">OpenSecrets.org reported</a>. \"He also brought in an unprecedented amount of donations from women donors. Nearly 1.9 million women donated to Biden’s campaign — compared to roughly 505,000 for Trump — accounting for 47 percent of his total fundraising.\" Sometimes, Trump spins a tale about he could easily raise millions of dollars with a single phone call to a corporate executive -- transactions that would violate campaign finance limits.
