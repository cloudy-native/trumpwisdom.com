Never even discussed...No, that was never even contemplated, nor would it be contemplated.”","analysis":"In this book \"Fear,\" Bob Woodward reported Trump had considered assassinating Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Trump flatly denied the story and held it up as evidence that the book shouldn't have been published. “It should not have been written about in the book,” Trump said. “It’s just more fiction. The book is total fiction. Okay?” But then in 2020, after Woodward published a second book on Trump, \"Rage,\" the president confirmed that he had indeed requested Assad's assassination. He told Fox and Friends that Defense Secretary James Mattis had effectively stood in the way of his efforts to assassinate Assad. “I would've rather taken him out,” Trump said. “I had him all set. Mattis didn't want to do it. Mattis was a highly overrated general.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
