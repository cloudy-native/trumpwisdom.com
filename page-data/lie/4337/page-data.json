Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony & discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC. Do you believe Nelly worked for Fusion and her husband STILL WORKS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF “JUSTICE.” I have never seen anything so Rigged in my life. Our A.G. is scared stiff and Missing in Action. It is all starting to be revealed - not pretty. IG Report soon?  Witch Hunt!”","analysis":"Trump attacks a career Justice Department official, who had contacts with British agent Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, which was hired by the Democrats to investigate Trump's ties in Russia. He suggests that this makes the process \"rigged\" when in fact Ohr was not involved in the Russian investigation and it's unclear what role he might have played. Ohr's wife did assist in assembling the dossier.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"9581, 9040, 5556, 5049, 4509, 4609, 4482, 4483, 4382, 4470, 4471, 4343, 4337","repeated_count":"13","date":"08/11/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
