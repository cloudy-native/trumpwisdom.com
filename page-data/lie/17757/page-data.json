But a manufacturing problem caused the CDC to distribute flawed tests to state and local health departments. On top of that, having the CDC take the lead, rather than the private sector, was inappropriate for the task of testing potentially hundreds of thousands of people. Two former Trump administration officials had warned on Jan. 28, in a Wall Street Journal article, that the CDC was not up to task and the private sector needed to be engaged. But the Trump administration waited another month before it fast-tracked the development of tests by private companies.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"21260, 18996, 19564, 18737, 19551, 19516, 19480, 19461, 19207, 18599, 19051, 18139, 17757, 17731, 18558, 18518","repeated_count":"16","date":"04/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
