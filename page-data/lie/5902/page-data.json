He came in, and then he took chain migration, and he brought his mother, and his father, and his brother, and his sister, and his aunt, and his grandfather. None of them working. It ended up being approximately 22 people who came in. It's called a chain.”","analysis":"Trump says terror suspect Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov brought 22 relatives into the United States through \"chain migration\" or the diversity visa lottery. But no agency has confirmed this figure and experts say it is implausible because Saipov only had a green card, meaning he could only bring in his wife (already in the U.S.) or his minor children (already U.S. citizens).
