Obama had a ceiling of admitting 130,000 refugees a year, Trump slashed that to 18,000, and Biden would seek to increase it to 125,000. The Biden immigration page says he would reverse Trump’s additional restrictions on asylum seekers traveling through Mexico or Guatemala, would not prosecute asylum seekers for “misdemeanor illegal entry,” and would undo attempts “to prevent victims of gang and domestic violence from receiving asylum,” among other changes. There is little evidence that increasing the number of refugees would \"open the floodgates for radical Islamic terrorism,\" as Trump often claims.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"29839, 29926, 30214, 30299, 30530, 29310, 29381, 29440, 29610, 29534, 29706, 29953, 30121, 28707, 29038, 29129, 29160, 28686, 28760, 28077, 28168, 28337, 27843, 27730, 26837, 27186, 27338, 27501, 26397, 26224, 26127, 25705, 25580, 25472, 25526, 25419, 26557, 25925, 25127, 25061, 24944, 24696, 24511, 24457, 24017, 23809, 23701, 23508, 23183, 23078, 22457, 22938, 22206, 22845, 21243, 21510, 21421, 21463, 22609","repeated_count":"59","date":"10/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
