And Saudi Arabia has really done a good job in that respect. They pumped out a lot more oil than was going to be pumped out, when I called them about four weeks ago. And if you look at oil four weeks ago, it was at 82, 83, and was going up to a 100 a barrel. That would have doubled your prices and even tripled your prices at the car, for gasoline. And instead, you have very low gas prices all over the country. That's because of what I did, and Saudi Arabia helped us.”","analysis":"As a general matter, the president has little power to move prices at the gas pump in any direction because they depend on market forces beyond his control. Trump is also wrong to claim that Saudi Arabia alone can move these prices. As FactCheck.org <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2018/11/is-trump-responsible-for-falling-gasoline-prices/\">explained</a>, a variety of factors in the market contributed to the falling price of gasoline.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
