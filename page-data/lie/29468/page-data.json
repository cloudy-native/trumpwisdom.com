Biden says he would allow existing fracking operations to continue but would not grant new permits on federal lands. (That’s a big difference, given that about 90 percent of 982,000 wells in the United States are on private lands, subject to state and local regulation, according to the Bureau of Land Management.) Biden also would not abolish fossil fuels. His plan on energy and the environment calls for “net-zero [carbon] emissions no later than 2050.” That’s 30 years from now. In the interim, Biden’s plan says, “we must look at all low- and zero-carbon technologies,” leaving the door open to carbon capture and other fossil-fuel-based sources. The “net-zero” language is a term of art, meaning that some fossil fuels would continue to be used so long as their emissions are offset by other means. Trump frequently suggests Biden changed his tune on fracking after he won the nomination but that's incorrect, though the Trump campaign tried to seize on verbal stumbles.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30925, 31432, 30346, 29772, 29872, 30148, 30184, 30186, 30201, 30210, 30219, 30249, 30489, 29215, 29275, 29323, 29405, 29468, 29475, 29563, 29731, 29978, 29988, 29998, 30000, 30004, 30105, 28712, 28887, 28900, 29061, 29085, 29171, 28609, 28413, 28485, 28594, 28738, 28820, 28853, 28009, 28100, 28261, 28270, 28350, 27960, 28007, 27573, 27799, 27616, 27776, 26958, 26767, 26626, 26690, 27087, 27410, 26921, 27233, 27298, 26440, 26494, 26182, 26265, 25768, 26098, 26104, 26158, 25645, 25653, 25717, 25557, 25483, 25405, 25338, 25153, 25174, 25609, 25604, 25593, 26603, 25803, 25816, 25108, 25046, 24890, 24896, 24783, 24855, 24682, 24712, 24727, 24628, 24567, 24369, 24382, 24401, 24427, 24477, 24034, 24059, 24086, 24087, 23947, 23948, 23991, 23348, 23528, 23614, 23672, 23394, 23463, 23535, 23215, 23251, 23185, 22098, 22069, 21947, 22361, 20942, 20966, 21008, 21202, 21550, 22412, 22492, 23023, 20866, 21323, 21362, 21764, 21212, 21736, 22692, 22638, 21513, 21425, 21466, 21192, 21165","repeated_count":"141","date":"11/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
