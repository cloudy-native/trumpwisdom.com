Isn’t it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? The $40,000,000 Commissioner must now make a stand. First time kneeling, out for game. Second time kneeling, out for season/no pay!”","analysis":"The NFL policy actually says players must stand if they’re on the field while the anthem plays or stay in their locker rooms for the anthem. Some teams have announced they will not fine players or coaches for kneeling on the sidelines during the anthem despite the NFL’s new policy.\n\nRoger Goodell, the NFL commissioner, signed a contract extension in late 2017 worth $200 million over five years if — and this is a big if — all incentives are met and bonuses are granted. Goodell’s base salary reportedly is less than $10 million annually. Plus, over several previous seasons, the commissioner’s salary was cut repeatedly.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
