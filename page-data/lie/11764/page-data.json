They are both a disgrace to our Country, the Enemy of the People, but I just can't seem to figure out which is worse? The good … news is that at the end of 6 years, after America has been made GREAT again and I leave the beautiful White House (do you think the people would demand that I stay longer? KEEP AMERICA GREAT), both of these horrible papers will quickly go out of business & be forever gone!”","analysis":"When Trump doesn't like what's being reported, he calls it fake news. But in almost every case, the reports are proven to be accurate and the substance of Trump's complaint is that the facts reflect poorly on him. Reputable news organizations follow ethical rules and correct mistakes promptly, something Trump knows since he often celebrates these corrections on Twitter. These overheated comments are not based in facts.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
