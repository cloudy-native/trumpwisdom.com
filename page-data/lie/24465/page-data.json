Medicare Advantage average national premiums have gone down under Trump's administration, and they went up under Obama — by less than 50 cents. (Also, there isn't one Medicare premium; what people pay depends on their plan choices. In fact, 60% of Medicare Advantage enrollees pay no premium for their plan. But among those who do pay a premium, the amounts are noticeably higher than the nationwide average for all plans.)  Moreover, the larger expense that affects most enrollees is the Part B premium, which has gone up under both administrations. In fact, Part B premiums have gone up faster in Trump’s first three years than they did in Obama’s first three years.\n\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"27669, 26821, 26648, 26501, 25466, 24465","repeated_count":"6","date":"09/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
