In the latest survey, released in June, medium and large manufacturers’ confidence had increased to 20-year highs but small manufacturers’ confidence had decreased. This survey, however, is not representative of all manufacturers. NAM members make up 6 percent of manufacturing firms. This is a very low level of coverage for a survey of this kind. The trade group declined to say whether its members are surveyed randomly.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"11214, 5634, 4573, 3737, 3726, 3760, 3883, 4158, 3827, 3832, 4068, 4006, 4037, 3542, 3546","repeated_count":"15","date":"06/27/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
