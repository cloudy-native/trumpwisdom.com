They've been off by 5 percent, 10 percent, 15 percent; I think I read one at 40 percent -- 40 percent. And these are small, easy-to-control elections.”","analysis":"In elections held primarily by mail, it's not unusual that 5 percent of ballots or more might be rejected. (Trump exaggerates by claiming anywhere from 10 to 40 percent of ballots are affected.) These rejections are almost all because of mismatched signatures, failure to sign an affidavit, or another deficiency in the ballot -- not because of fraud.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/16/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
