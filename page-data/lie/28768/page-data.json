Think of that, 42%.”","analysis":"Trump can cherry-pick whatever numbers he wants, but the United States ranks poorly compared to its peers on most measures of the coronavirus. At the time when Trump made these comments, claiming Europe had an 50% greater excess mortality rate, the CDC’s <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm#dashboard\">latest estimate</a>, which covers deaths between Feb. 1 and Sept. 12, had a middle estimate of 241,222 excess deaths. That’s versus 211,025 excess deaths through week 38, or Sept. 20, for 24 European countries or parts of countries, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.euromomo.eu/graphs-and-maps\">according to EuroMOMO</a>. When adjusted for population, the U.S. had 730 excess deaths per million people, which was 6 percent higher than the EuroMOMO region’s 686 excess deaths per million. After the second wave of the pandemic struck Europe with force, by mid-December the excess deaths in Europe per million people had moved slightly higher than in the United States. But that was long after Trump made these statements.
