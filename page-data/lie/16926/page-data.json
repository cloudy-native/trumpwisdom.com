But I went and I made speeches, and we had rallies, and we did a great job and we won. We took two seats. Nobody writes about that. If we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year.”","analysis":"Trump is wrong to claim these two seats were not supposed to go the Republicans. The 3rd Congressional District heavily favored the GOP, and Republican Greg Murphy won easily. The 9th Congressional District hasn't elected a Democrat since 1963. But the race between Republican Dan Bishop (R) and Dan McCready (D) was considered a toss-up, and Bishop won.\n ","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/06/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
