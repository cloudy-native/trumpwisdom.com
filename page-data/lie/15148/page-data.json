But the facts say otherwise. Congress approved the aid in September 2018. A top Defense Department official certified to congressional committees on May 23 that Ukraine had made sufficient progress on anti-corruption efforts to merit the security funds. The Pentagon announced a $250 million aid package June 18. That’s how it typically works. But, on Trump’s orders, the White House informed the Pentagon that Ukraine’s aid was being frozen, and didn’t release the funds until Sept. 11, weeks before the deadline. Trump didn't raise corruption concerns in his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, according to the rough transcript released by the White House. Moreover, there’s simply nothing that shows the White House conducted a review of corruption in Ukraine while it withheld the $250 million in aid through the Defense Department or $141 million in aid through the State Department. ","pinocchios":"4","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"16176, 16590, 15238, 14759, 14798, 13926, 14839, 14845, 15273, 15261, 15493, 15164, 15148","repeated_count":"13","date":"10/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
