We’ll be up to, by the end of this year, 115 miles. ... And that doesn't include large amounts of wall that we’ll be starting before the end of the year. So we'll be up to hundreds of miles of wall between new wall and renovation wall in a fairly short period of time. It’s the one thing. So I’m building the wall now, as we speak. And I'll continue to build the wall, and we'll get the wall finished.”","analysis":"The definition of a wall is a continuous structure with a common base, while a fence is something that has posts and can be seen through. There are roughly 100 miles of fencing that was funded through 2017 and 2018 appropriations that will replace smaller, less-effective structures, such as barriers made of Vietnam War-era helicopter landing mats. That’s what is happening in Calexico, near the California-Mexico border, where there were about two miles of landing-mat fencing. Officials said one problem with the landing-mat fencing is that agents could not see through to the other side. Trump here is redefining fencing as \"wall.\"\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
