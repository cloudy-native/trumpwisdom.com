They're killing each other for many, many years. For decades and decades, they're killing each other. Two countries, they're killing each other. I said, 'So we're doing a deal with them, deal with them. Wh -- what are we doing? I'm not doing any deals unless they get together. They gotta get together. What do we want to have people kill each other for?' We made a deal like in about 15 minutes. And they were in the Oval Office, hugging and kissing and saying how much they love each other. And it's gonna last, believe it or not. I really believe that will last.”","analysis":"Trump falsely-- and bizarrely -- takes credit for ending a war between Serbia and Kosovo that ended more than two decades ago. Despite continued tensions, the two sides have not directly fought each other since 1999. Trump helped negotiate an economic normalization deal between Kosovo and Serbia, but that agreement mostly involved economic and transportation links, and it did not solve tougher geopolitical issues like Serbia’s refusal to recognize Kosovo ever since the country declared its independence in 2008.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30386, 30272, 29720, 30033, 28579, 28391, 27963, 28257","repeated_count":"8","date":"10/28/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
