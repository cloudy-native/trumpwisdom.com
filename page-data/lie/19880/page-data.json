And they would come -- now I'm here more than three years. They would come every year trying to get money. And after two, three years, I said, why do you guys have to come back every year? And they said, well, nobody's ever given -- we always have to come back. And one of them said, we feel like beggars coming into the White House begging for money. And I said, we shouldn't have to do that. You shouldn't have to do that. And I got them long-term financing for the historically black colleges and universities. And they're great people. I got to know them very well.”","analysis":"Trump regularly touts his support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), often with a lengthy, anecdotal story that appears to be invented and has little basis in reality. He's referring to bipartisan legislation, dubbed the FUTURE Act, that the Congress passed in December, 2019. The legislation extended $255 million in annual STEM funding for minority-serving colleges, including roughly $85 million specifically allocated to HBCUs. Obama had put in place <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-signs-executive-order-promoting-excellence-innovation-and-sustainab\">a ten-year programming stream</a> but Trump had let it lapse. (Trump often makes it sound as if Obama refused to do this and Trump had to come to the rescue.) Moreover, the funding for HBCUs is a congressional initiative. “Congress does all this work and presents it to him in the budget, and he can choose to sign it. This year [2019], he held off on signing some significant STEM funding, making HBCUs beg for it,” said Marybeth Gasman, a Rutgers professor and one of the leading authorities on HBCUs. “Most HBCU support is the result of Congress. Trump has promised all kinds of things to HBCUs and has followed through on little. Under Trump, the White House Initiative for HBCUs was moved to the White House and is quite quiet compared to the work under President Obama’s administration.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Education","repeated_ids":"30380, 29833, 29919, 30295, 30322, 30528, 29304, 29379, 28282, 27002, 26734, 26768, 27277, 27548, 26386, 26322, 25413, 25318, 25371, 25215, 25079, 24958, 23480, 23267, 23118, 22116, 22078, 21937, 21914, 22466, 21890, 22137, 21349, 21276, 20667, 20110, 20060, 19983, 20218, 20190, 20197, 19877, 20315, 19879, 19880, 19878","repeated_count":"46","date":"03/04/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
