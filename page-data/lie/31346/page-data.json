The Democrats had argued that minorities ended up having a larger proportion of their ballots rejected, so the settlement laid out steps to notify voters if there was a potential problem with a signature match. Under the settlement, voters must be contacted the next business day — by phone or email — if their absentee ballot is rejected because of a signature issue. “The State of Georgia entered a consent decree that essentially did one thing and one thing only … instead of giving three days to inform a voter there was an issue with their ballot, [it] is down to 24 hours when you're within 11 days of the election,” said Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/georgia-press-conference-on-election-count-updates-transcript-november-17\">at a Nov. 17 news conference</a>. “That is the one and only thing that that consent order addressed in any real way.” Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GASecretaryofState/posts/3561858110596406\">a Facebook post</a> in November, noted that the rejection rate from 2018 to 2020 was the “exact same. … So, the idea that some settlement agreement that we entered into changed how counties were doing this is basically nonsense.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31346, 31159, 31212, 31269, 31258, 31070, 30669, 30626","repeated_count":"8","date":"01/06/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
