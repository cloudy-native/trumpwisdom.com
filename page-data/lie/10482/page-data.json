There’s a highway in a state not so far away -- took 20 years to get it approved. And they had an opening, fairly recently -- not a big road -- it's, sort of, not even a highway. It’s less than a highway. But by the time it ended up, it was 20 years late....We're trying to get it down. It takes 17, 18 years to get a highway approved. We're trying to get it down to one. We have it down to two. We think we can get it down to one.”","analysis":"This is a wide exaggeration. According to our friends at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/does-it-take-10-years-get-permit-build-road-donald/\">Politifact</a>, recent government studies say the permit approval time ranges from 4.6 to 6.6 years. The only study that claims a 10-year approval is common comes from a pro-deregulation group, which raises questions about its reliability. This still falls short of Trump's 21 year claim.
