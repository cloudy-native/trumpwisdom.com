I was going to lose by at least 12 to 14 points and then we sent a letter of complaint and the next week they changed the poll. That was the day of the election. They changed the poll and it was like even, I said, ‘How do we go from 12 to 14 points?’ We sent a legal letter to them and we're even and then we won the election.”","analysis":"This is grossly misleading. The ABC tracking poll did find that Trump was down 12 points in its initial wave, released on Oct. 23, 2016. The Washington Post co-sponsored later waves of the survey with ABC, Hillary Clinton's advantage shrank as the vote drew nearer, and the difference remained very close up till Election Day, with Clinton up 47 percent to 43 percent at last count. (She won the popular vote by 2.1 percentage points.) The Post did not receive legal correspondence from the Trump campaign about this poll.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
