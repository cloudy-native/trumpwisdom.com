Maybe I did a better job because I’m good with the Twitter and I’m good at social media, but the truth is they were all on Hillary Clinton’s side, and if you look at what was going on with Facebook and with Google and all of it, they were very much on her side.”","analysis":"Trump alludes to the \"true interference,\" but at this point, the Russian interference in the 2016 is well documented with the special counsel indicting Russian operatives. Plus,  U.S. intelligence agencies found unanimously that Putin ordered a cyber espionage and propaganda campaign to help Trump's chances. There's no evidence to support the idea that the social networks were favoring HIllary Clinton during the 2016 election.
