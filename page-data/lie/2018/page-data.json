It’s under negotiation as we speak.  But think of it:  When Mexico is making all of that money, when Canada is making all of that money, it’s not the easiest negotiation.  But we’re going to make it fair for you people again.”","analysis":"Trump frequently suggests the United States is “losing money” --or the other country is \"making money -- when there is a trade deficit, but that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price.  If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Mexican goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce the purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would “gain” money that had been lost.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/08/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
