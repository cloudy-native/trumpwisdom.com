They own him, they control him, and they know he will always do their bidding. And you know, when he raises 300 million like last month, I could raise much more than him. I'm President. I could call all these Wall Street guys, most of whom I know. I could call the oil guys, I could call them all. I would be -- I would blow his numbers apart. Give me two hours. As they send me ten million -- No, we don't need it. How many commercials can you buy? You know, we raised -- we raised a lot of money. We raised enough money. ...But I would be the greatest fundraiser of all time. 'This is the President of the United States calling for the head of Goldman Sachs. Hello. How are you, Bill? Is everything -- Is everything good? Uh, listen, I'd like $25 million within the next five minutes. Send it to the White House, please.' What, do you think he's gonna say no? Ev -- I would be the greatest. But you know what, I chose not to do that, okay? I chose not to go there, and when you see he raised $300 million, his people are making deals all over the place.”","analysis":"Without evidence, Trump suggests Biden is guilty of corruption because he is raising so much more money than the president. But Biden gathered a lot of donations from small donors too. \"Biden ultimately beat out Trump with both large donors and smaller contributors giving $200 or less,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/11/biden-wins/\">OpenSecrets.org reported</a>. \"He also brought in an unprecedented amount of donations from women donors. Nearly 1.9 million women donated to Biden’s campaign — compared to roughly 505,000 for Trump — accounting for 47 percent of his total fundraising.\" Sometimes, Trump spins a tale about he could easily raise millions of dollars with a single phone call to a corporate executive -- transactions that would violate campaign finance limits.
