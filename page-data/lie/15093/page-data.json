Right? Were you there? And they've been trying to get this thing approved for years and years and years and they couldn't. And then President Trump came along and I got those permits so fast for them. These big energy executives were sitting back and they couldn't get it approved. Nothing they could do, wouldn't get it approved. Your governor was lousy, they were all lousy. Nobody could help. That thing was so dead and I came along and I got it approved and then the consultants probably called up these big energy executive, ‘Sir, we were able to get it approved for you.’ I never even saw these people, but I know it was a good thing. … So I got that plant approved and I came down two months ago, right? Two and a half months ago, cut a ribbon. I'd never seen anything so big and now they're going to double it up, I understand. And they're building an even bigger one in another location of Louisiana.”","analysis":"Sempra Energy announced its plan to create an LNG export terminal in 2012 in a partnership with Japanese companies.
