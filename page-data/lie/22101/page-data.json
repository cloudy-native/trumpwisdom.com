But it is a signature Trump lie to suggest he was opposed to it. We searched high and low — as did other reporters — and there is no evidence Trump was an opponent of the March 2003 invasion of Iraq, let alone a vocal one. In fact, he offered lukewarm support. When Howard Stern asked if he supported invading Iraq, Trump replied, “Yeah, I guess so. You know, I wish the first time it was done correctly.” In another interview on Fox News, two months before the invasion, he said Bush had to make a decision: “Either you attack or you don't attack.” Shortly after the invasion, he again told Fox News: “It looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.” Not until August 2004, in an interview with Esquire, did Trump publicly express opposition to the war. By then — 17 months after the invasion — many Americans had turned against the war, making Trump’s position not particularly unique. Biden's evolution was similar.\n","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"31341, 28843, 27929, 26833, 24769, 22101, 20999, 21209, 21266, 20011, 19925, 18773, 18054, 17610, 14705, 14104, 14231, 13912, 12778, 13586, 13323, 12628, 11331, 7714, 7246, 3770, 0060","repeated_count":"27","date":"08/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
