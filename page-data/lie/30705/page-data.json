Remember that name. Most Favored Nation rule. Nobody has ever done this.....Medicare will now look at the price that other developed nations pay for their drugs. And instead of paying the highest price on that list -- and we are substantially higher than any other country in the world -- we will pay the lowest price. In other words, we take the lowest price, and we match whatever the lowest price is, leading to colossal savings for all Americans. And we're talking about savings of 50, 60, 70 percent, 80 percent -- different drugs, different prices.”","analysis":"As noted above, a federal judge almost immediately blocked this policy from taking effect because of the rushed way the \"most favored nation\" rule was crafted. If implemented, such an order would require drugmakers to accept the lowest price from the government for medicines paid by comparably wealthy countries in Europe and elsewhere — an aggressive move the pharmaceutical industry is fighting vociferously. Trump had signed an executive order in July, but he didn't need to issue executive orders for his administration to start experimenting with new Medicare payments; he clearly wanted to be able to claim he was doing something on drug prices ahead of Nov. 3.
