In fact, Flynn pleaded guilty before two different judges to lying to the FBI in 2017, though he and the Justice Department are now seeking to throw out the case. Special counsel Robert Mueller got convictions for several Trump campaign officials and Russians -- showing he uncovered significant criminality. The special counsel's report on Russia concluded that the Trump campaign was aware of and welcomed Russia's help in the 2016 election, though there was not enough evidence for conspiracy charges. The Mueller report concludes that Trump potentially obstructed justice at various points in the Russia probe and pointedly says the president was not exonerated despite the lack of charges","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
