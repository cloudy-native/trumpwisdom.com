If we didn't test, you wouldn't be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.”","analysis":"This is a nonsensical statement. The number of coronavirus cases is rising because the disease has been spreading for months, abetted in part by a lax and inconsistent response from U.S. political leaders. As of mid-2020, the total number of new weekly cases had been rising, and the rate of positive test results also was increasing. Without testing, the scope of the pandemic would be unclear and hospitals and doctors would not be able to prepare. Ending testing would not end the spread of the disease. \"When the virus is under control, testing doesn’t uncover more cases. It’s a tool for keeping the epidemic at bay,” said former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"31566, 30195, 28954, 29133, 28773, 28267, 28351, 27933, 27565, 27877, 27919, 27921, 27666, 26966, 27022, 26763, 26777, 26886, 25989, 24339, 24209, 24114, 23962, 23563, 21538, 22967, 21053, 21068, 22113, 22880, 21843, 22791, 21259, 21381, 21371, 22751, 22756, 20924, 21604, 22593, 21087, 21147, 20876, 20687, 20705, 20721, 20663, 20673, 20634, 20628, 20659, 20496, 20552, 20380, 20439, 20453, 20456, 20079, 20090, 20067, 19890, 19990, 19842","repeated_count":"63","date":"07/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
