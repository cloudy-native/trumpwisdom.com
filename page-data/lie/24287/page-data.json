But here's what he did: He released classified information, highly classified information and confidential information, all different categories.”","analysis":"Trump accused his former national security adviser, John Bolton, of including classified information in his book, \"The Room Where It Happened,\" which paints Trump as an incompetent commander-in-chief. Bolton, a careful operator with decades of Washington experience, has denied the accusation and his lawyers say that career officials cleared the book for publication after reviewing the manuscript for classified information, but that political appointees at the White House later overruled the career officials to claim that the book did contain state secrets. A federal judge ruled that the Justice Department's lawsuit against Bolton for allegedly releasing classified information could proceed, but the court did not rule on the merits of the claim.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/16/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
