The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act provides confidentiality to whistleblowers. Trump is also wrong on the facts. Virtually all of the claims in the whistleblower's Aug. 12 complaint have been corroborated by other sources, including by Trump himself. Finally, the right to confront accusers applies only in the court system. Impeachment in Congress works differently and confrontation rights are not part of the package, though Trump would be able to challenge the evidence against him in a potential Senate trial.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/29/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
