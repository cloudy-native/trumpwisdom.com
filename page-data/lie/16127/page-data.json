This was -- Benghazi was a disaster. They showed up a long time after it took place. They saw burning embers from days before. I said, 'Get out today, immediately.' They were saying, 'We think we can have them tomorrow.' I said, 'Nope.They got to go right now.'

The Benghazi facility was not a consulate or even an official site; the U.S. ambassador just happened to be there. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad cost $750 million and is heavily secured. While Trump often says it took days for additional forces to arrive in Benghazi, they came just hours after attack that killed the ambassador and in the midst of the attack on the CIA annex.
