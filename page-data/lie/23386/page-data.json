The candidate and his allies say they trust vaccines. StatNews reported, “Only once apolitical government scientists and outside experts endorse a Covid-19 vaccine will the [Biden] campaign encourage Americans to follow federal vaccination guidance.” In other words, statements from political appointees wouldn't be enough to convince them of the effectiveness or safety of a vaccine. That’s not the same as saying they are against it, would delay it or will refuse a vaccine as Trump often claims.
