You’d be great,” Navy Admiral Ronny Jackson. And a report just came out, and I should have brought it because I would have read it, but it’s long but beautiful for Ronny Jackson. Secret Service are all over the place. And they wrote a report that what he said was so false and so untrue.”","analysis":"Tester, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Veteran Affairs Committee, made public several allegations against Jackson. The White House conducted a review that found evidence of minor incidents but not the most serious allegations Tester had described, and the Secret Service released a statement denying several allegations. The Defense Department inspector general is investigating Jackson but has not released a report. Republicans believed Jackson to be unqualified, and Tester’s actions had the support of Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.).","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"11756, 6800, 5478, 4849, 4874, 4925, 4112, 2958, 2960","repeated_count":"9","date":"07/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
