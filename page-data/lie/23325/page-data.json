These shutdowns are ridiculous, and only being done to hurt the economy prior to the most important election, perhaps, in our history! #MAGA”","analysis":"Trump often chastises Democratic governors — particularly of swing states — for not opening their economies or for implementing lockdowns. However, every state in the union — including North Carolina and Michigan — had begun reopening by mid-June at the latest, months before Trump started his critiques. In other words, no state is under a highly restrictive stay-at-home order — and most of those have been lifted for months. Trump also falsely says the Democrats were only keeping their states closed to enhance their election chances.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"30924, 29786, 30230, 30282, 30445, 29514, 29566, 29695, 29944, 30067, 28946, 28434, 28534, 28732, 28815, 27978, 27567, 27867, 27724, 27770, 26970, 27047, 26619, 26905, 26861, 27353, 26419, 26484, 26230, 26279, 26573, 26054, 25993, 25858, 24897, 24704, 24718, 24587, 24588, 24453, 24291, 24306, 24083, 23872, 23412, 23323, 23325, 23591, 23598, 23599, 23471, 23530, 23235, 22786","repeated_count":"54","date":"09/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
