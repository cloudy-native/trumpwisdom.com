Thank you America, we are doing Great Things.”","analysis":"Rasmussen poll is a right-leaning poll, so it consistently rates Trump higher than most other polls. Obama had a rating of 49 percent on April 13, 2010, so it's unclear why Trump would say he was \"much higher\" when his number was 50 percent on April 13. A single poll is not always the most reliable. Trump had an approval rating of 40.8 percent in the 538 average of polls, compared to Obama's average of 47.9 percent for April 13, 2010.
