They'll give me a Pinocchio.”","analysis":"Trump is right, he does earn a Pinocchio on this. As our colleague Andrew van Dam has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/05/24/real-surprisingly-comforting-reason-rural-america-is-doomed-decline/\">documented</a>, comparing rural and urban areas is distorted by the fact that successful rural counties are often reclassified over time as urban. At our request, van Dam ran the numbers on a variety of measures for job growth and found virtually no difference between the Obama years and the Trump years. But, he noted, \"it’s easy to imagine a scenario where Trump’s claim is technically true, even if it’s massively misleading. Rural growth numbers are very small, so tiny differences can lead to huge multiples. For example, if the rural economy grew at an annual 0.0133 percent during Obama’s second term, and it grew at 0.4 percent during Trump’s first term, then Trump could claim a 30x growth advantage, even though both (made up) numbers technically round to 0 and the difference could be considered rounding error.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
