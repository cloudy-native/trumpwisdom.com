So the 180 million people on private plans through employers would not necessarily go without coverage. Furthermore, Democrats do not want to replace the Affordable Care Act. Although there are many cases of premiums and other costs rising sharply, key provisions of the law have allowed millions of people to access health insurance coverage.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
