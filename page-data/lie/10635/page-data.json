Nearly two decades ago, the same politicians who gave us NAFTA also voted to admit China into the World Trade Organization, a disastrous, really decision. I mean, that was a disastrous decision. Since then, we've lost 60,000, not jobs, listen to this, 60,000 factories. Here's the good news, we're building them all back, they're coming back.”","analysis":"Millions of manufacturing jobs and thousands of U.S. manufacturing establishments have disappeared since NAFTA took effect in 1994 and China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it's difficult to isolate how much of that was because of NAFTA and China's accession to the WTO, and not other factors such as automation. The studies we reviewed indicate NAFTA had a modest effect on the U.S. economy. Auto industry representatives and independent analysts seem to agree the NAFTA dynamics have helped rather than hindered automakers with U.S. operations.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
