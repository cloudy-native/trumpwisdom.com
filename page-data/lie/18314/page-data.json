You know, I think, I'm a totally brilliant human being. I think I'm the smartest person. So, I came up with a plan. I'll never forget. I was in New Hampshire. I came up with this idea because everybody kept coming up to me and say, sir, it's really terrible what's happening with healthcare. We're waiting in line for two weeks, for four weeks, for seven weeks. Honestly, people were waiting in line, they weren't very sick. They were terminally ill, truthfully, before they saw a doctor, by the time they got to the doctor. So, I came up with this incredible plan. Only I could think of this, and I said here's what you do, here's what you do, if somebody can't get a doctor quickly because we have great doctors at the VA, they don't get enough credit. If you can't get to a doctor quickly, you go outside. You go locally. You get a doctor, we pay the bill, you get yourself well better, right? So, I went back. I went back and I told my people, do you have any idea how smart I am? Listen to this plan I have. They said, actually, sir, we've known about that plan for 52 years. We just couldn't get it approved. So, I said it's too bad. I thought it was brilliant, but what I am good at is getting things approved, and I got it approved and people are using it.”","analysis":"Trump constantly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/23/trump-obama-veterans-choice-act/?arc404=true\">pretends he passed the VA Choice bill</a>, in what The Washington Post called a \"false sense of accomplishment.\" Trump actually signed the MISSION Act, which was only a modest update of the VA Choice law passed by Obama in 2014. So it's ridiculous for him to often claim that it took 40 years to pass the law -- and for him to suggest Obama failed to act to help veterans. (Sometimes Trump says 44, 45 or even 48 years.) Despite Trump’s claims, it's not clear that veterans are facing shorter wait times. The MISSION Act only took effect in 2019, but before its implementation Trump often acted as if it already had achieved results.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"31616, 31597, 29842, 29930, 30306, 30536, 29248, 29384, 29445, 29638, 29544, 29714, 29960, 29993, 29044, 28673, 28460, 28576, 28803, 28080, 28173, 28340, 27999, 27903, 27735, 28211, 26840, 26675, 27148, 27482, 27189, 26389, 26467, 26512, 26217, 26122, 25700, 25573, 25470, 25524, 25440, 25143, 25258, 25015, 25055, 24940, 24815, 24688, 24646, 24563, 24438, 24196, 24099, 24010, 23684, 23485, 23557, 23581, 23152, 23171, 23065, 22106, 22075, 22357, 21000, 22403, 22181, 21877, 21317, 22829, 21283, 21229, 22656, 22668, 20829, 21488, 21403, 21450, 22599, 20739, 20587, 20519, 20418, 20018, 19984, 19912, 20203, 20311, 18719, 18648, 18842, 19582, 18765, 17704, 17619, 17824, 17788, 17424, 17848, 18331, 17154, 18314, 18324, 16852, 16597, 16149, 16052, 16275, 15999, 15874, 15923, 15422, 14881, 15557, 15457, 15530, 14684, 13924, 13872, 13120, 13471, 12954, 13427, 13400, 13680, 13731, 12990, 12700, 12531, 12536, 12363, 12443, 12329, 11607, 12159, 12072, 12114, 12235, 11902, 11235, 11831, 11854, 11807, 11749, 11130, 10650, 10769, 10995, 10891, 10381, 10130, 10161, 9800, 10086, 10031, 9528, 9456, 9362, 9173, 9156, 8728, 8528, 8408, 7815, 7850, 7367, 7534, 7191, 6706, 6864, 6879, 6940, 6976, 7128, 7161, 6833, 6918, 6623, 7065, 6648, 6311, 6008, 6404, 6150, 6502, 5916, 5432, 6072, 5610, 5349, 5375, 5322, 5543, 5829, 5230, 5786, 5170, 5678, 4914, 4494, 4692, 4720, 4453, 4624, 4559, 4205, 4243, 3901, 3693, 3671, 4175, 4097, 4067, 4005, 3012, 1207, 1003","repeated_count":"217","date":"01/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
