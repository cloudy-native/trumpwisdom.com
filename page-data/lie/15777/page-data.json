If you look at a chart, it was like a rollercoaster down, nothing up. And that was going on for a long time. You wouldn't have had a NATO if you kept going that way. And now we've really increased it incredibly well, and I'm happy to have helped.”","analysis":"Spending by European NATO and Canada declined 14 percent in constant 2015 dollars from 1989 to 2016, largely because of the end of the Cold War, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2019_11/20191129_pr-2019-123-en.pdf\">according to NATO figures</a>. But the effort to push NATO members to spend more on defense began well before Trump took office. At the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, the Obama administration secured an agreement by member nations to aim to increase their spending on defense to 2 percent of each nation’s gross domestic product within 10 years. In any case, the money would not be going to the United States or even necessarily to NATO; this is money that countries would spend to bolster their own military, which in turn supports all of NATO. In constant dollars, European NATO and Canadian spending on defense in 2019 is roughly equal to the level in 1989.
