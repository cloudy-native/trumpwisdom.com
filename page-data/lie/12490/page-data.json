Over the past many decades, the U.S. has been paid very little by South Korea, but last year, at the request of President Trump, South Korea paid $990,000,000.Talks have begun to further increase payments to the United States. South Korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defense provided by the United States of America. The relationship between the two countries is a very good one!”","analysis":"This is totally false. The U.S. neither spends $5 billion a year on defending South Korea nor did the Koreans agree to pay $500 million more. They agreed to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/world/asia/trump-south-korea.html\">a $70 million increase</a>, going to $925 million. Under a long-standing agreement, South Korea paid nearly $830 million a year to host U.S. forces -- representing half the cost. The Wall Street Journal <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/military-spending-spat-stirs-worry-over-u-s-forces-in-korea-11549195200\">reported</a> that Trump administration officials asked South Korea for a 50 percent increase. Trump may think he got it, but he didn't. As a percentage of its GDP, South Korea spends more on defense than the United States. And the U.S. keeps nearly 28,500 troops in South Korea not just to defend that country but to further its own interests in the region.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"16656, 15802, 12490, 12604, 11319, 10556, 10869, 10249, 8787, 8717, 8475, 6020, 5371, 5772","repeated_count":"14","date":"08/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
