You know, this is -- this was final night prior to a very, very big victory. That was it. Remember?

The Michigan venue where Trump rallied in the early morning hours of Election Day 2016, DeVos Place in downtown Grand Rapids, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/11/08/donald-trump-holds-late-night-rally-grand-rapids/93447114/\">has a capacity of 4,200</a>, far less than the 32,000 claimed by Trump. (Perhaps that many were waiting outside, for a total of 8,000, local media estimated.) Hillary Clinton held a rally the same day at nearby Grand Valley State University; it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://anchor.hope.edu/world/clinton-visits-grand-valley-state-university/\">described</a> as a “capacity crowd” at a venue that holds 4,100 people.
