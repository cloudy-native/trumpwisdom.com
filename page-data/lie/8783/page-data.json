Think of that. And these are arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of approximately 100,000 assaults, 40,000 larcenies, 30,000 sex crimes, 25,000 burglaries, 12,000 vehicle thefts -- and these are new numbers, brand-new numbers -- 11,000 robberies, 4,000 kidnappings, and 4,000 murders.”","analysis":"These figures involve a mix of serious and nonviolent offenses such as immigration violations. Notice how Trump switches quickly from the total for arrests over two years (266,000) to the total for charges and convictions: “100,000 assaults ...  30,000 sex crimes ... and 4,000 murders.” These numbers for arrests and charges are apples and oranges. By switching from one to the other, Trump confuses the issue and exaggerates the criminality. In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, and not all charges result in convictions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26673, 9553, 9265, 9134, 8783, 8738, 8625, 8490, 7809, 7764","repeated_count":"10","date":"02/13/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
