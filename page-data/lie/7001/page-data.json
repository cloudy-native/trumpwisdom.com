This is a California problem, and if you notice, almost every race — I was watching today — out of like 11 races that are in question, they're going to win all of them. The Republicans don't win, and that’s because of potentially illegal votes, which is what I've been saying for a long time.”","analysis":"Trump, without evidence, suggests that the slow process of counting California’s mail-in ballots means that undocumented immigrants are casting votes. He has never given an explanation as to why the late votes that are counted would be from undocumented immigrants. There is no evidence that undocumented immigrants are voting in California in vast numbers, let alone enough to swing an election. Voter fraud is extremely rare, though obviously errors can be made. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles acknowledged in October that 1,500 people may have been incorrectly registered because of a processing error — including at least one noncitizen (a legal resident, not an undocumented immigrant). The incorrect registrations were canceled before the election.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/14/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
