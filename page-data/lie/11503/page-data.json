President Obama wanted to meet, and Chairman Kim would not meet him. The Obama administration was begging for a meeting.”","analysis":"No public records or news articles show that Obama ever tried to meet with Kim. Former U.S. intelligence officials and experts on North Korea said they knew of no evidence for Trump’s claim. Many of Obama’s top advisers on North Korea said Trump’s claim was false. Obama’s strategy after 2012 was to escalate sanctions and avoid entreaties to North Korea. He very clearly told the world he was not interested in a meeting.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/30/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
