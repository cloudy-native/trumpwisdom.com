They pulled in front of the bus and slowed down to try to stop the bus in the middle of the highway.\" Staff on the bus called the police, which assisted the bus in reaching its destination, the campaign said. The campaign canceled its events that day. The FBI’s San Antonio office said that it is \"aware of the incident and investigating.\" One Trump supporter <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/truthserum4all/status/1322229225714311170?s=20\">tweeted</a> video of the incident, saying \"trolling is fun.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
