It's so ridiculous. No planes, let's not fly anymore. It is crazy. But personally, they should go for it. I love it. It's one of the greatest plans I've ever seen, as long as they're the ones that have to sell it, not me.”","analysis":"In reality, the Green New Deal resolution has no teeth and wouldn’t become law if it passed. So these claims are based on a retracted FAQ about a nonbinding resolution. In these documents, proponents of the Green New Deal mused about ending air travel. Problematic as those lines were, none made it into the resolution. High-speed rail would become an airplane alternative for some travelers under the terms of the Green New Deal, but it wouldn’t end commercial air travel. Travelers who prefer flights over high-speed rail would still have a choice.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30947, 29481, 29087, 28444, 27661, 28858, 28016, 28106, 28265, 27801, 27628, 26956, 26628, 27085, 27336, 26371, 26396, 26095, 26159, 25530, 25163, 26539, 26002, 24409, 24184, 24091, 23465, 23117, 22449, 22292, 22908, 20867, 21903, 22691, 21514, 20053, 20282, 18570, 16839, 16210, 16441, 15705, 14141, 13650, 12759, 11047, 11792, 10486, 10513, 10887, 10264, 10171, 9883, 9712, 9531, 9588, 9075, 9128, 9043, 8730, 8670","repeated_count":"61","date":"02/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
