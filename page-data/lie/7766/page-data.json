These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.”","analysis":"No government statistic tracks children smuggled in by bad actors, “coyotes” or drug gangs. What Trump is referring to is CBP’s number for family unit apprehensions and unaccompanied minors. The family unit by definition must include at least one parent or legal guardian and one minor. (There’s a separate figure for unaccompanied alien children.)\n\nDHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman said the December total for apprehensions of unaccompanied children and those with family members was 19,313. But it’s wrong to describe it as a statistic that represents children being smuggled into the country.\n\nTrump describes this as children being smuggled in by coyotes or gangs, but border officials screen for false claims of parentage. To imply as Trump does that a child’s mother, father or legal guardian is or hired a smuggler, coyote or gang member in all of these cases is wrong.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8275, 8113, 7806, 7766, 8214, 7875","repeated_count":"6","date":"01/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
