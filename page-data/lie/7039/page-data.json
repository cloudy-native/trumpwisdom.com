I put it on social media, because I'm being nice. And they said, 'Well, what do you want?' 'Well, I want a pardon, I want a pardon.' … 'What did you do?' 'Murder.' Murder! Homicide, something. What did you do? Murder. And she -- this is one of the people in the caravan, by the way. What did you do? Murder.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/gmiC7e4lvug?t=1170\">an interview</a> on Fox News's \"Ingraham Angle\" on Oct. 30, 2018. A Honduran man traveling with a migrant caravan said through a translator that he wanted to enter the United States and seek a pardon for third-degree attempted murder. That's serious, but not as serious as just saying \"murder,\" which was Trump's characterization. A murder means someone died. An attempted murder does not involve a victim's death.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/01/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
