But there is a difference between cities that clearly limit information-sharing on immigration and citizenship with the federal government (the specific part of federal law that the White House uses) and cities that do not comply with immigration detainers (which doesn't apply to the law the White House uses). The White House lumps both types of cities into one statement, obfuscating the facts and twisting the law out of context.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
