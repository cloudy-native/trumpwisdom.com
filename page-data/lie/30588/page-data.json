The day after the election, the Democrat was ahead by 130,000 votes — not 200,000 — with 750,000 ballots to be counted. On the night of Nov. 12, Biden was projected by Edison Research to win the state, with a lead of a little over 11,000 votes with about 11,000 ballots left to be counted.\n\n“It does appear that Joe Biden will win Arizona,” the Republican attorney general of Arizona, Mark Brnovich, said on Fox Business on Nov. 11. “There is no evidence, there are no facts that would lead anyone to believe that the election results would change.”\n\nHe said that “less than 200 votes that are in question and doubt,” which obviously would not be enough to change the results.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
