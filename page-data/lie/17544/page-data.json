Think of it: 15 people. Out of billions of people, 15 people...The 15 -- of the 15, most of them are doing very well. One is quite sick, frankly. Most of them are doing really well. And the 15 will soon be down to 3 or 4 because we take them off the list as they get better and they're recuperate. Like, if you had the flu, you recuperate. You get better. And they're recuperating....We have 15 people instead of thousands of people. Okay? It could have been thousands of people. But we have 15 people who are almost all better now.”","analysis":"In late February, Trump played down the number of coronavirus cases in the United States, frequently saying there were only 15 and they would soon be better. He often claimed the low figure was the result of travel restrictions he placed on non-U.S. citizens traveling from China. At the time the virus was spreading rapidly through the United States, largely undetected because the Trump administration failed to quickly set up effective testing. In early March, the case load started to explode. By March 4, there were more than 100 confirmed U.S. cases and six people had died. One week later, there were 800 cases and 27 deaths. By March 30, there were more than 165,000 cases and 3,000 deaths.
