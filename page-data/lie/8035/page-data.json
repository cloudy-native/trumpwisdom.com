People in the news business have a different definition of fake news -- things that did not happen. Reporters do make mistakes, but responsible news organizations correct them. Reputable news organizations do not make up stories; it is a fireable offense.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
