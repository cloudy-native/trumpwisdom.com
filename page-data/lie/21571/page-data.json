Anthony. That was a great thing. That was very popular too. That was a very good one.”","analysis":"The National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House said the pardon was wrong. \"Objection! Mr. President, Susan B. Anthony must decline your offer of a pardon today,\" the museum's president and chief executive, Deborah L. Hughes, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://susanb.org/on-news-of-a-presidential-pardon-for-susan-b-anthony-on-august-18-2020/\">said in a statement</a>. Hughes explained that pardoning her goes against what Anthony fought for when she was put on trial in June 1873, for voting illegally. Anthony was forbidden from speaking as a witness in her own trial, and the judge denied her a jury. She was found guilty and issued a $100 fine, which she refused to pay. \"To pay would have been to validate the proceedings. To pardon Susan B. Anthony does the same,\" Hughes wrote.
