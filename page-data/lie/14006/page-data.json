It became a much smaller country because of Afghanistan.”","analysis":"Russia was one of 15 Soviet Republics in the former USSR. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979 to prop up a Communist government that had seized power before it was toppled by political unrest. The United States secretly funded Afghan insurgents who helped make the war a quagmire for the Soviets — what the State Department says became “the longest and largest [covert action] in U.S. history to that point.” The Afghan war might have been a contributing factor to the Soviet Union’s collapse but it was certainly not the only factor. The biggest factor likely was a collapse in oil prices after Saudi Arabia altered its oil policy in 1985, which led to massive borrowing by the government and then an effective bankruptcy of the country.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
