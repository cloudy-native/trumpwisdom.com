And I think there's great danger to it, and I think a lot of fraud and misuse could take place...we don't want to have Pennsylvania, where you have a political governor -- a very partisan guy -- and we don't want to have other states -- like Nevada, where you have the head of the Democratic clubhouse as your governor. We don't want to be in a position where he's allowed to, every day, watch ballots come in. 'Gee, if we could only find 10,000 more ballots.'”","analysis":"Trump is referring to court rulings attempting to accommodate the vast number of mail-in ballots.
