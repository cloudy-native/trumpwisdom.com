Nearly 1 million additional African Americans have found new jobs. As a -- really, and I think this -- we can really attribute it to regulatory cuts or as a result of our tax cuts.”","analysis":"Scholars increasingly believe that the official poverty estimate is somewhat misleading and not especially informative. This is in large part because transfer payments — such as the earned-income tax credit or food stamps — are not recorded as income, so their impact isn’t incorporated into the official figure. To assuage these concerns, the Census Bureau introduced a second poverty measure in 2011 — the Supplemental Poverty Measure. For African Americans, the SPM's lowest point was in 2016 with a slight uptick in 2017. BLS data show that African American employment has increased by 828,000 from Trump's first full month in office through January 2019, which is nearly 1 million. But Trump attributes this increase to his moves on cutting regulations and taxes, which is a stretch. Moreover, the tax cut passed in December 2017, nearly a year into his term. Year over year, in January 2019, black employment had increased by roughly 500,000.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"17149, 15341, 14403, 14080, 12210, 11363, 11510, 10606, 8904, 7284, 7378, 7384, 6591, 5907, 5416, 5601, 5527","repeated_count":"17","date":"02/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
