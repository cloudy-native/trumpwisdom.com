It worked out well, it was a good success, and, you know, it's like, uh, when something works out well, you like it? That was, I was very young, a job in Cincinnati, Swifton Village. Did anybody hear of Swifton? Swifton. Anyway, and we bought it, and we sold it, and it worked out nice.”","analysis":"Trump did spend time in Cincinnati at Swifton Village. By all accounts, at best, he did menial labor around the property and we found no evidence that he ever lived there or \"worked there\" with any regularity. There were charges of discrimination and a lawsuit during the Trumps ownership tenure. Without knowing the cost of repairs or legal expenses and the rental income, it's impossible to know if they profited on the project, but all signs suggest any profit they made was not a windfall or a great success by Trumpian standards.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"27802, 19283, 17270, 11591, 5403, 5433, 4413","repeated_count":"7","date":"10/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
