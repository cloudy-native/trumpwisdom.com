I've done things that nobody else -- and I've said this, and I say it openly, and not a lot of people dispute it: I've done more for black Americans than anybody, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln. Nobody has even been close.”","analysis":"Sometimes, Trump says he has done more than any president since Lincoln -- but often he even leaves out Lincoln. Trump appears to base this assertion on pre-coronavirus employment figures and some relatively minor actions taken during his administration. Historians say this claim is ridiculous. Trump has taken few actions specifically on behalf of African-Americans. By contrast, Lincoln freed the slaves in the Confederacy and pressed for passage of constitutional amendments to give them equal status under the law. Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which also had lasting impact on the lives of African Americans. These legislative victories were not easy, requiring Johnson to build coalitions with Republicans and liberal Democrats to defeat the powerful segregationists in his own party who dominated the South. Trump is never one to be modest, but this kind of bragging is simply ridiculous.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"30363, 29834, 29920, 30296, 30323, 30529, 29305, 26945, 26753, 26875, 27274, 27546, 26287, 25414, 25317, 25213, 25094, 24981, 24957, 23120, 23057, 22086, 22079, 21956, 22374, 22467, 21893, 21348, 22809, 21277, 22703, 20912, 20075, 20111, 20189, 20292, 20369, 19803, 17811, 17540, 17114, 16938, 12209","repeated_count":"43","date":"07/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
