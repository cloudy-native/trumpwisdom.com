And people had that scheduled for anywhere from five to ten years and you all know the story. We took an existing building. We played around with it. We renovated it. We fixed it up. We use Jerusalem stone, one of the finest stones actually in the world, Jerusalem stone. So, instead of spending 1 billion and the papers were right in front of me – sir, would you please approve this? What is it? This is for the embassy in Israel, American, sir. I said, \"How much?\" \"$1 billion, Sir. 1 billion!\" I immediately called our great ambassador to Israel, David Friedman — very successful man, great lawyer, one of the most successful lawyers in the country before he decided to do what he's doing. I said, \"David, they want us to pay a billion dollars for the embassy. I don't want to pay a billion dollars.\" I said, \"Study it – do you have any buildings that we own?\" We own so much we don't even know what the hell we own. \"Find some building in a great location. Call me back.\" Called me back two days later. He said, \"Mr. President, Sir, we own the best site in Jerusalem. It's big. It's beautiful and it's got a building on it. I can take that building and renovate it. I can do it for $140,000...And I said, \"David, do me a favor, don't make it $140,000. Sounds too cheap. Make it like 400,000. That's okay too, David.\" So we saved almost a billion dollars ... And we started working – and for $400,000, we actually have a very beautiful American Embassy in Jerusalem — really beautiful.”","analysis":"The new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem. Costs for the permanent embassy could well surpass $400,000 when all is said and done.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"07/31/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
