That is the biggest increase — not adjusted for inflation — since the year that ended in December 2008.\r\n\r\nBut adjusted for inflation, wages for all workers grew 1.3 percent from December 2017 to December 2018, making the increase only the largest since August 2016, according to the Labor Department. It’s worth noting that although real wage gains were higher in 2015 and 2016, that was a period of almost no inflation. So Trump can claim some credit for decent real wage growth now with inflation back at about 2 percent.\r\n\r\nThe Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, says nominal wage growth has been below a 3.5 percent target during the recovery. But the White House argues that traditional economic measures do not fully capture increases in compensation, such as bonuses, and so real wages have actually increased even more than shown in the economic data.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"20224, 17960, 16687, 15416, 15669, 15343, 14406, 14133, 13138, 13204, 13506, 13208, 11692, 11197, 11222, 11054, 10469, 10505, 10524, 10863, 10239, 9994, 9868, 9558, 9374, 9211, 8609, 7964, 7965, 7855, 7746, 7099, 6674, 6838, 6742, 5299, 5302, 5496, 5819, 5192, 5153, 5680, 5635, 4778, 4782, 4788, 4811, 4845, 4695, 3699, 3758, 4154, 3831, 4065, 3995, 3473, 3538, 3962, 3252, 2965, 2713, 2736, 2624, 2563, 2648, 2388, 2241, 2279, 2220, 2284, 2188, 1770, 1848, 1548, 1356, 1141, 1127, 1066, 0977","repeated_count":"79","date":"02/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
