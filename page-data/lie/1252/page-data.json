So a married couple, up to $24,000, can spend their money on their family, on their children, on what they have to do — so much better.”","analysis":"It’s debatable that this would be much better for a middle-class couple with children — and it could be worse. The tax plan would nearly double the standard deduction, $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, but also eliminate personal and dependent exemptions (currently $4,050 per family member). So a couple with two children already “don’t pay a dime” on their first $28,800. That’s because they get $12,600 in a standard deduction and $16,200 in dependent and personal exemptions. It’s possible Trump’s expanded child tax credit might help make up some of the difference, but maybe not.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"2675, 2519, 2246, 2225, 1264, 1252","repeated_count":"6","date":"09/27/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
