So we're talking about now more than three years is the lowest for any U.S. President in recorded history.”","analysis":"This was ingenious spin, but it's worth fact checking because the average over three years is hardly comparable to a four-year or eight-year average for other presidents. For example, the unemployment rate average was lower in Lyndon Johnson's second term than it had been under Trump. But when Johnson's first term is factored in, Trump gained the edge. Anyway, once unemployment soared because of the coronavirus pandemic, Trump's talking point quickly became out of date -- showing the folly of making such claims before a presidential term is complete. By the time his term ended, Trump was the first president since World War II to leave office with a net reduction in jobs during his presidency.
