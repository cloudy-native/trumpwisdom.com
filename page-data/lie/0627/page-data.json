After years and years of stagnation, they said that's never going to happen; we've got to start it. It's going to happen, and it's about 48,000 jobs.”","analysis":"In contrast to Obama, who always played down the number of jobs that would be created by the Keystone XL Pipeline, Trump inflates the numbers. The project would create part-year work in four states for 10,400 workers, the State Department determined. That added up to 3,900 annual construction jobs. About 12,000 other annual jobs would stem from direct spending on the project. So that adds up to 16,000, most of which are not construction jobs.
