We have a 22,000-seat arena, but I think we're going to also take the convention hall next door, and that's going to hold 40,000. So we'll have 22,000 plus 40,000, which would mean they would have over 900,000 people that won't be able to go.”","analysis":"Only 6,200 people showed up for the rally, according to the Tulsa fire marshall. An event for the \"40,000\" overflow crowd was canceled as the arena could not be filled. Campaign officials later admitted they knew hundreds of thousands of people who registered were fake.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
