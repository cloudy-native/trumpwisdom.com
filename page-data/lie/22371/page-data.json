Well, you can't be a great President when much of what he's done we've undone. And you can't be a great President when you leave 142 empty judgeships.

You understand it better than anybody, the people in this room. Left us 142. First day in office, I said, 'How many judges do I have to appoint?' 'Sir, you have 142.' I said, 'You have to be kidding.'  One hundred and forty -- so I had a big head start.”","analysis":"There were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2018/06/04/senate-obstructionism-handed-judicial-vacancies-to-trump/\">88 district and 17 court of appeals vacancies</a> when Trump took office, so a total of 105 -- not through Obama's lack of effort.
