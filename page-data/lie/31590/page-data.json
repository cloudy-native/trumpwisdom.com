It depends on whether one counts Barack Obama’s intervention in Syria as a “new war” or an extension of the conflict in Iraq started under George W. Bush. (The Islamic State terror group emerged in the aftermath of that war.) Obama did not not deploy any troops to Libya when NATO began a campaign in Libya aimed at saving civilians in Benghazi threatened by Libyan government forces. Meanwhile, Trump ramped up commitments in Iraq and Syria initially to fight ISIS (while also launching airstrikes on Syria for chemical weapons), added troops in Afghanistan, and escalated hostilities with Iran, including the killing of Iranian General Qasem Solemani. Trump said that strike was carried out in accordance with the Authorization for Use of Military Force resolution of 2001.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/19/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
