The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the Iran nuclear deal is formally known, actually bars Iran from ever seeking, developing or acquiring nuclear weapons. Trump is alluding to the argument that some restrictions in the deal sunset over time and that Iran could pursue a nuclear weapons program in secret once those restrictions are gone. But it's a huge stretch into falsehood to say the deal gives Iran the right to nuclear weapons when it says the opposite.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"28085, 28343, 24941, 24738, 24328, 22381, 20996, 18091, 17762, 16102, 16122, 16167, 16399, 13215, 13369, 13629, 13121, 12144, 12126, 11406, 11991, 11444, 11886, 11906, 11245, 11879, 11880, 11740, 10825, 10669, 10683, 7945","repeated_count":"32","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
