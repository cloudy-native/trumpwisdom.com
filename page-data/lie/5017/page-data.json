In 2011, five years before the 2016 election, soybeans peaked at $13.40 per bushel. In May 2018, soybeans cost $9.84 per bushel. That’s a 27 percent drop. Measuring since 2011, the lowest price was $8.56 in March 2016. Tariffs and trade barriers are not pushing these prices down; record soybean plantings and record yields are the cause.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"10216, 6441, 5335, 5291, 5703, 4980, 4995, 5017, 4436","repeated_count":"9","date":"09/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
