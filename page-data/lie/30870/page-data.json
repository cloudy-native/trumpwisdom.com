Doug Ducey, a Republican, responded to Trump in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/dougducey/status/1333603735855976450\">Twitter thread</a>: \"I've been pretty outspoken about Arizona’s election system, and bragged about it quite a bit, including in the Oval Office. And for good reason. We've been doing early voting since 1992. Arizona didn’t explore or experiment this year. We didn’t cancel election day voting as some pushed for — we weren't going to disenfranchise any voter. In Arizona, we have some of the strongest election laws in the country, laws that prioritize accountability and clearly lay out procedures for conducting, canvassing, and even contesting the results of an election. We've got ID at the polls. We review EVERY signature (every single one) on early ballots — by hand — unlike other states that use computers. Prohibitions on ballot harvesting. Bipartisan poll observers. Clear deadlines, including no ballots allowed after Election Day. The problems that exist in other states simply don't apply here. I've also said all along, I'm going to follow the law.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
