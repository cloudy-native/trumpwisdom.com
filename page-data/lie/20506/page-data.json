Papadopoulos tried futilely for months to arrange a meeting between top campaign aides and Russian officials. In asking the court for leniency, Papadopoulos said he made “a terrible mistake, for which I have paid a terrible price, and am deeply ashamed,” and that he was motivated to lie to the FBI try to “create distance between the issue, myself, and the president.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
