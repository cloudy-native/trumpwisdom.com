He refuses to look at a mountain of corruption & dishonesty. We win!”","analysis":"Trump has focused his ire at alleged election corruption in Philadelphia, even though he gained ground in the city, compared with 2016, while losing ground to Biden elsewhere in Pennsylvania. Trump is behind by more than 60,000 votes as of Nov. 12. So the logic of his attacks on the city’s election process is faulty.\n\nAs for Schmidt, he is the Republican member of the board overseeing Philadelphia elections. “We just had the most transparent and secure election in the history of Philadelphia. I have seen the most fantastical things on social media, making completely ridiculous allegations that have no basis in fact at all,” Schmidt said, adding: “I realize a lot of people are happy about this election and a lot of people are not happy about this election. One thing I can't comprehend is how hungry people are to consume lies.”The Trump campaign has touted the testimony of “a whistleblower” who said that a supervisor in Erie, Pa., tampered with ballots. But then the postal worker recanted the claim in an interview with postal inspectors.\n\nThe Trump campaign has also advanced an argument that people who sent mail-in ballots were treated differently in Democratic-leaning areas than Republican areas, with voters in Democratic areas given more of a chance to fix possible problems, such as failing to include a security envelope or failing to sign an outer envelope. That case is still pending.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/11/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
