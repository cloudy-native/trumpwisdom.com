If you go to San Diego where we just built a beautiful new long stretch of wall. If we didn't have that wall, California would be infected like nobody's ever seen before because the stretch just to the left of San Diego right next to the wall is heavily infected in Mexico.”","analysis":"Trump claims the border fence he's building helped contain the coronavirus outbreak, but public health experts said it made no difference because travelers from China and Europe brought the virus to the United States and it spread over following months due to lax and inconsistent public health measures inside the country. The specific claim about Tijuana, Mexico, is false. San Diego, Calif., which is across the border from Tijuana, and a range of U.S. cities including Washington, D.C., where Trump resides, all had higher covid-19 infection rates than Tijuana when Trump made these remarks.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"20543, 20399, 20426, 20759, 20328","repeated_count":"5","date":"06/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
