And they had 23 murders. It's a lot of murders. But it's not close to 2,000 murders, right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico.”","analysis":"Even though Juarez and El Paso sit roughly a 20-minute drive from each other across the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, the two cities have vastly different homicide rates. El Paso had 23 slayings in 2018, according to the El Paso Police Department. Juarez did not have “nearly 2,000” slayings in 2018 but 1,032, according to the Mexican government.\n\nThe president regularly claims this difference can be attributed to the physical barrier between the cities. But El Paso had the third-lowest violent-crime rate among 35 U.S. cities with a population over 500,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 — before construction of a 57-mile-long fence started in mid-2008.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
