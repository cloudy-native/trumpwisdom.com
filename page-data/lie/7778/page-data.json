Can you believe that, 235,000? ...Including those charged or convicted of more than 100,000 assaults and nearly 4,000 murders.”","analysis":"Trump warns about dangerous criminals, but the numbers he’s citing involve a mix of serious and nonviolent offenses such as immigration violations. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reports yearly arrest totals without breaking down the type of offense, which could be anything from homicide to a DUI to illegal entry. In fiscal 2018, ICE conducted 158,581 administrative arrests for civil immigration violations. The agency’s year-end report says 105,140 of those (66 percent) involved people with criminal convictions and 32,977 with pending criminal charges. Of the 143,470 administrative arrests in 2017, 74 percent involved people with criminal records and 15.5 percent who had pending charges. But these totals cover all types of offenses, including illegal entry or reentry. Looking at charges and convictions does not give a total for “criminals,” because one individual may be facing multiple charges, as ICE notes in its yearly reports.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"7777, 7778","repeated_count":"2","date":"11/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
