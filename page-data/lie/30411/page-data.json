These really phony polls, I have to call them phony polls. Fake polls were designed to keep our voters at home, create the illusion of momentum for Mr. Biden and diminish Republicans’ ability to raise funds.”","analysis":"This is just a conspiracy theory. Pollsters underestimated the turnout for Trump, but they are not operating at the behest of Democrats. Trump attacked a number of polls by name, including one by The Washington Post, but polls all have a margin of error, and at least one out of every 20 polls comes up with a result that is beyond the margin of error.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
