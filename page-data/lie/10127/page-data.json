Lee, a great general. Whether you like it or not, he was one of the great generals. I have spoken to many generals here, right at the White House, and many people thought -- of the generals, they think that he was maybe their favorite general. People were there protesting the taking down of the monument of Robert E. Lee. Everybody knows that.”","analysis":"Trump is trying to excuse his controversial statement that there were “very fine people on both sides” during the deadly confrontation in Charlottesville. The “Unite the Right” rally was partly organized by a well-known white nationalist, Richard Spencer, and included both neo-Nazis and white supremacist groups. Former Ku Klux Klan head David Duke was a scheduled speaker. The cause they were protesting — the removal of Lee’s statue — is one supported by many nonwhite supremacists and nonwhite nationalists, but this rally was clearly not one for your average supporter of Confederate monuments. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/08/very-fine-people-charlottesville-who-were-they-2/\">Fact Checker investigation</a> found there were white supremacists, there were counter protesters -- and there were heavily armed anti-government militias who showed up on Saturday. The militia groups were not spurred on by the Confederate statue controversy. They arrived in Charlottesville heavily armed and, by their own account, were prepared to use deadly force — because of a desire to insert themselves in a dangerous situation that, in effect, pitted them against the foes of white supremacists.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"26291, 25764, 22472, 10127, 10214, 18702","repeated_count":"6","date":"04/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
