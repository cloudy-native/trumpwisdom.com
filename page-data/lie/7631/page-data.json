Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!”","analysis":"Trump had long promised that Mexico would be forced to pay for the wall, but as president he has mostly sought money from Congress. Administration officials have refused to explain Trump's logic for making this claim. The updating of the North American Free Trade Agreement negotiated by the Trump administration makes some changes at the margins. But if that results in a smaller trade deficit because Mexico is buying more goods from the United States, it does not necessarily translate into greater revenue for the U.S. government. Congress would still have to appropriate funds that it has refused to do. Trump cannot order the military to build the wall without authority from Congress.
