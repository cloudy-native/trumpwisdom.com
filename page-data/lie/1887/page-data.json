The media refuses to mention this. I said Gillespie and Moore would lose (for very different reasons), and they did. I also predicted  “I” would win. Republicans will do well in 2018, very well! @foxandfriends”","analysis":"Trump endorsed both Ed Gillespie in his race for Virginia governor and Roy Moore in his race for Alabama senator, and yet both lost. There have been six special elections since Trump took office, but the president is overstating his record. Republicans have won five of these elections, all of which took place in districts where the seat was previously held by a Republican, but the margins were much narrower. The sixth election was in California's heavily Democratic 34th district, where Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) appointed California attorney general. He was succeeded by fellow Democrat state Assemblyman Jimmy Gomez.
