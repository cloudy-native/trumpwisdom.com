I think it's a very big threat. And I think I did a great thing when I terminated the ridiculous Iran nuclear deal. It was a horrible, one-sided deal that was $150 billion, plus $1.8 billion in cash, and lots of other bad things.”","analysis":"Trump always uses too high an estimate, $150 billion, and makes it sound like the United States cut a check to Iran. But this was always Iran’s money. Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe because of international sanctions over its nuclear program. The Treasury Department estimated that once Iran fulfilled other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. The Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion. As for the \"$1.8 billion in cash,\" this is  related to the settlement of a decades-old claim between Iran and the United States. An initial payment of $400 million was handed over on Jan. 17, 2016, the same day Iran’s government agreed to release four American detainees, including The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian. The timing — which U.S. officials insisted was a coincidence — suggested the cash could be viewed as a ransom payment. But the initial cash payment was Iran’s money. In the 1970s, the then-pro-Western Iranian government under the shah paid $400 million for U.S. military equipment. But the equipment was never delivered because the two countries broke off relations after the seizure of American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran. Two other payments totaling $1.3 billion — a negotiated agreement on the interest owed on the $400 million — came some weeks later. Perhaps that’s a matter of opinion, but experts said that Iran was generally in compliance with the agreement when Trump decided to terminate it.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29452, 29687, 29967, 28670, 28214, 28806, 28998, 28084, 28175, 28341, 28002, 27686, 28238, 26842, 27150, 27328, 27517, 26383, 26471, 26220, 26125, 25703, 25576, 25329, 25393, 26578, 25919, 25124, 25058, 24936, 24755, 24862, 24737, 24641, 24390, 24327, 24198, 25018, 23908, 23798, 23855, 23668, 23486, 23273, 23067, 22006, 22382, 21677, 22478, 22987, 22992, 22126, 21500, 21424, 20534, 20100, 20044, 18093, 17761, 16527, 16640, 16166, 16350, 14160, 14446, 12543, 12705, 13122, 12547, 11620, 12202, 11405, 11416, 11973, 11312, 11907, 11447, 12260, 12250, 11296, 11211, 11742, 11124, 10827, 10684, 10272, 10120, 9901, 9723, 8583, 7944, 7688, 6837, 6124, 5434, 6324, 5382, 5325, 5532, 5833, 5775, 5777, 5719, 5728, 4880, 4975, 4430, 4246, 3734, 4127, 3580, 3983, 4031, 3520, 3923, 3347, 3071, 3079, 3108, 3095, 3016, 2983, 2924, 2908, 2315, 2089, 1872, 1382, 1471, 1394, 1015","repeated_count":"131","date":"01/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
