He has a different view. By the way, everybody has a different view. Different views on everything. It doesn't mean they're wrong or they're bad people, but people have different views.”","analysis":"Atlas is a highly controversial figure; he is a radiologist, not a specialist in public health or infectious diseases. Many experts in those fields said he spread misinformation on the coronavirus. A resolution, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.stanford.edu/2020/11/20/faculty-senate-condemns-actions-hoover-fellow-scott-atlas/\">introduced by members of the Faculty Senate Steering Committee at Stanford University</a> -- Atlas is a senior fellow at Stanford's Hoover Institution -- and approved by 85 percent of the senate membership, specified six actions that Atlas has taken that “promote a view of COVID-19 that contradicts medical science.” Among the actions cited are: discouraging the use of masks and other protective measures, misrepresenting knowledge and opinion regarding the management of pandemics, endangering citizens and public officials, showing disdain for established medical knowledge and damaging Stanford’s reputation and academic standing. The resolution states that Atlas’ behavior is “anathema to our community, our values and our belief that we should use knowledge for good.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"26721, 24228, 23952, 22969","repeated_count":"4","date":"10/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
