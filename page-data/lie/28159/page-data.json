You don't do that. You don't do that with these countries. We could do, it would be so easy. It's like they raise all this money. $300 million. And they're saying, Oh, Trump is being out-raised. I would be the greatest fundraiser. All I have to do is call all the Wall Street guys, call all the guys, call on everybody. I would get five, 10, 15, 20, 25 million every time I made a phone call. But you know what? I could never basically deal with those companies properly again. So I don't do it. And we don't need the money. We got a lot of money for this stuff. We got another eight days to go. They had like $200 million. A lot of it's small money, you know, $61 average, small money. That's never happened to a Republican before, but this way you don't have to sell your soul. When somebody gives you a lot of money, it's, you know, it's not to say quid pro quo. I'm sure Joe would never do a thing like that, you know. But the fact is he's making deals. He's making deals. I could do it much easier, 'cause I'm much better at it if I wanted to be. And think of it, I'm the president of the United States calling the head of Goldman Sachs, 'Goldman Sachs! Listen,' oh, I know, I know 'em all. 'I want you to give me $25 million, I'm running the campaign, please give me 25 million.' They never report this stuff. And they would say, 'Where do we send the check? And we can have it there in one hour, sir.' But I don't wanna do that because I'm compromised. Once you do that, you're compromise. They're compromise. They're compromise.”","analysis":"Without evidence, Trump suggests Biden is guilty of corruption because he is raising so much more money than the president. But Biden gathered a lot of donations from small donors too. \"Biden ultimately beat out Trump with both large donors and smaller contributors giving $200 or less,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/11/biden-wins/\">OpenSecrets.org reported</a>. \"He also brought in an unprecedented amount of donations from women donors. Nearly 1.9 million women donated to Biden’s campaign — compared to roughly 505,000 for Trump — accounting for 47 percent of his total fundraising.\" Sometimes, Trump spins a tale about he could easily raise millions of dollars with a single phone call to a corporate executive -- transactions that would violate campaign finance limits.
