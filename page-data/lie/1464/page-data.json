We have the highest tax rate anywhere in the world. How foolish is this? Our business tax rate is 60 percent higher than our average economic competitor.”","analysis":"Trump exaggerates about corporate taxes. The U.S.  certainly has one of the highest statutory corporate tax rates in the world, currently pegged as high as 39.1 percent when including state taxes. (The federal rate is 35 percent.) But also matters is the actual tax a company pays, after deductions and tax benefits. That is known as the effective tax rate, and the U.S. effective tax rate is 27.1 percent. For China, the statutory corporate tax rate is around 25 percent and effective tax rate is around 10 percent, according to Congressional Budget Office.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"26315, 10987, 10024, 9672, 2699, 2226, 2021, 1766, 1883, 1800, 1753, 1714, 1674, 1609, 1614, 1533, 1485, 1489, 1520, 1386, 1435, 1357, 1464, 1295, 1266, 1250, 1172, 1213, 1151, 1142, 1132, 1107","repeated_count":"32","date":"10/11/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
