The investigation, based on actual death certificates, compared the number of deaths with typical death rates, adjusting for many variables, including the mass exodus from the island in the aftermath of the storm. Puerto Rico has accepted this as the official death toll. Other studies that examined a shorter time period, found between 1,000-1,200 people died as a result of the storm.
