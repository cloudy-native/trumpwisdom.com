And that's fine. And we'll get along with China.”","analysis":"Tariffs have been collected on Chinese goods since the early days of the Republic. President George Washington signed the Tariff Act of 1789, when trade between China and the United States was already established. Tariffs on China have generated at least $8 billion every year since 2009. As we have often noted, China largely does not pay the tariffs. Importers pay the tariffs and they pass on the cost to consumers, so in effect they are a tax on Americans.
