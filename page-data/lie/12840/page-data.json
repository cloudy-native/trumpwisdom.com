First time that's ever happened.”","analysis":"Trump misquoted <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/for-the-first-time-ever-most-new-working-age-hires-in-the-us-are-people-of-color/2019/09/09/8edc48a2-bd10-11e9-b873-63ace636af08_story.html\">a Washington Post article</a>. The Post found that according to data collected by the government since the 1970s, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) were minorities, and minority women were predominantly driving the trend. That isn't the same as saying minorities and women (of all races and ethnicities) account for most of the new hires of prime working age. One big reason for this trend has nothing to do with Trump; it's because United States is becoming less white and prime-age Americans of color, in particular women, are a growing share of the prime-age overall and nonemployed populations.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"20268, 17254, 15342, 12378, 12840, 13171","repeated_count":"6","date":"09/22/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
