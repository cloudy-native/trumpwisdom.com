The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the World, refuses to help with illegal immigration & drugs!”","analysis":"It's unreasonable to say the southern border is unprotected. As of 2016, the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol employed more than 60,000 people and had a budget of more than 13 billion dollars. Plus, the organization has grown over the last decade. The U.S. has some of the most restrictive immigration laws. The Mexican government has taken a number of steps to trim down the size of the caravans, including offering work permits and helping to assess asylum claims. As for Mexico having “the strongest immigration laws in the world,” U.S. law treats unauthorized entry as a criminal offense, while it’s only a civil violation in Mexico. Prior to 2011, Mexico had an immigration law that made illegal entry into the country a crime, but that law was supplanted by a 2011 law that makes it a civil infraction and tries to balance tough enforcement with the respect for the rights of migrants within Mexico. Thus U.S. law, which now does deem illegal entry a crime, is a lot tougher than the current Mexican law. Laura González-Murphy, who advised officials in Mexico’s National Congress while the 2011 law was being drafted and wrote a book about the process, called it an “extremely humanitarian” policy. “It made the rights of migrants a priority,” she said.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"11428, 11919, 11829, 11127, 9808, 9818, 9643, 9704, 9623, 9483, 9597, 9603, 9439, 3817, 3549, 3487, 3014, 2682, 2815, 2830, 2690","repeated_count":"21","date":"03/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
