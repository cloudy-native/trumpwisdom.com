And they were named as a reconciliation to bring our country together. And then, all of a sudden, they cancel them out. Now, I'm not defending or judging any of the names because most of the names — you know Fort Bragg, but nobody knows who General Bragg is....To me, this was Fort Bragg named after somebody as a reconciliation matter. I mean he was a general, he was a tough general, he’s very tough, but this was done for reconciliation. These bases were named to bring the South because it was tremendous animosity from the many years to bring the South.”","analysis":"The bases were not named as a way to bring the North and South together. \"The bases, all in former Confederate states, were named with input from locals in the Jim Crow era. The Army courted their buy-in because it needed large swaths of land to build sprawling bases in the early 20th century up through World War II,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/06/10/trump-confederate-bases/\">The Washington Post reported.</a> \"Three of the biggest bases in the United States are named after Confederate leaders, including some who were famously inept. Fort Bragg in North Carolina, the headquarters of the Special Forces, bears the name of Gen. Braxton Bragg, a commander often assailed as one of the most bumbling commanders in the war. Bragg was relieved of command after losing the battle for Chattanooga in 1863, then served as a military adviser to Confederate President Jefferson Davis.\" To some extent, the bases were named to placate southerners upset at increasing integration in the military.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
