It's  [The Chinese government putting billions of dollars into Biden's family business] a disgrace.”","analysis":"Once again, we have Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, big sums of money and a foreign country. Except this time it’s China, not Ukraine. What happened here? In December 2013, Hunter Biden and one of his daughters flew from Japan to China with Joe Biden on Air Force Two. The vice president had diplomacy on his agenda. Days after the trip, Hunter Biden and a business partner had a new investment fund with backing from the Chinese government-owned Bank of China. What started as a $1 billion deal later grew to $1.5 billion, according to Peter Schweizer, a conservative author. Looking at the facts publicly available, it seems more like smoke than fire to us. It’s similar to how Ivanka Trump was granted Chinese trademarks days before and after President Trump vowed to save jobs at ZTE, a major Chinese telecom, in 2018. Or how Ivanka Trump was granted Chinese trademarks in 2017, on the same day she sat next to Chinese President Xi Jinping at a dinner.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"31315, 28202, 26979, 27285, 27496, 26335, 26239, 26262, 26077, 25719, 25559, 25341, 25149, 26546, 26015, 25973, 25845, 24776, 24594, 24392, 23407, 22368, 20964, 22135, 21338, 21171, 20483, 17613, 16804, 16450, 15985, 14846, 14550, 15583, 14996, 15487, 15497, 15499, 14189, 14624, 13908, 13601, 13065, 13461, 13031, 13229, 13185, 13198, 13372, 13378, 12828, 12851, 12874, 12928, 12815, 13345, 13097, 10693, 10694","repeated_count":"59","date":"05/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
