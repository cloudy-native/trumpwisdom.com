The White House Council of Economic Advisers <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/The%20Underestimated%20Cost%20of%20the%20Opioid%20Crisis.pdf\">estimated</a> in a 2017 report that “the economic cost of the opioid crisis was $504.0 billion, or 2.8 percent of GDP” in 2015. But that's not all due to drugs coming across the border. It also “includes individuals who abuse prescription painkillers such as OxyContin and Vicodin and individuals who abuse heroin or other illicit opioids,” the report said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/prescribing.html\">has said</a> that prescription drugs were involved in more than 35 percent of all opioid overdose deaths in 2017.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
