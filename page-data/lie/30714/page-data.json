They're all over. They were treated horribly all over this. … The poll watchers weren't allowed to watch. They were, in many cases, whisked out of the room, not only in pens that were 20, 30, 40, 60, 100 feet away where you couldn't even see.”","analysis":"Trump's repeated claims that GOP poll watchers were barred in key states are false. Affidavits can be offered as evidence but they are not established as fact until a judge or jury decides they are facts. In virtually all cases, the affidavits submitted by the Trump campaign and its allies have been dismissed by judges as failing to demonstrate serious fraud. Many simply <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/michigan--poll-watcher-affidavits/2020/11/11/4d073d7a-2447-11eb-a688-5298ad5d580a_story.html\">reported complaints</a> about rude behavior or unpleasant looks from poll workers or Democratic poll watchers. In other words, Trump keeps repeating claims that have already been rejected in court. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, for instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/19/trump-campaign-was-not-denied-access-philadelphias-ballot-count/\">ruled against Trump in a 5-2 decision Nov. 17</a>, finding that local election officials legally exercised their power in setting up a waist-high barrier and buffer zone of 15 to 18 feet between the campaign observers and the election workers inside the Philadelphia convention center. The state Supreme Court opinion stated that these conditions “allowed candidate representatives to observe the Board conducting its activities as prescribed under the Election Code.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31519, 31034, 31067, 30905, 30816, 30838, 30794, 30753, 31438, 30714, 30607, 31461, 30677, 30679, 30736, 30633, 30634, 30600, 30584, 30574, 30558, 30549, 30552, 30542","repeated_count":"24","date":"11/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
