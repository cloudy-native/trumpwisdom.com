It's total obstruction. It's a record of the history of our country there has never been -- Some people left the job a year and a half ago, two years ago, to become an ambassador or to work at one of our many great agencies and we can't get Schumer and his friends to approve them.”","analysis":"Republicans control the Senate and could confirm any pending nominee with a simple majority. In other words, Trump's pending nominees could be confirmed without Democratic votes. Democrats have tools to delay the process, but they cannot block it, and Trump has been slow to name people to many posts. It's also doubtful that 360 people are awaiting confirmation.
