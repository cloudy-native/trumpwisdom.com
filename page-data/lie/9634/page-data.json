But that’s wrong.\n\nMexico deported 436,125 individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras between January 2015 and September 2018, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/mundo/mexico-rebasa-eu-en-expulsion-de-migrantes?fbclid=IwAR3T5awda9nmftioLOi-kNA4XL6nlup4wpVeEHahHKVK4413aBLxjTnpG2A\">according to the Mexican newspaper El Universal</a>. From fiscal years 2015 to 2018, the United States deported 321,468 individuals from those same three countries, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement statistics.\n\nMexican authorities have announced plans to deploy security forces to a “containment” belt north of the Guatemalan border. Mexico in 2018 also agreed to host migrants who are applying for asylum in the United States while their cases are pending in U.S. courts, as The Washington Post reported.\n\nEl Salvador, meanwhile, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/us-officials-said-aid-to-el-salvador-helped-slow-migration-now-trump-is-canceling-it/2019/04/01/5a8ca570-540a-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html?utm_term=.ad632eb47af0\">has been praised</a> by top U.S. immigration officials for effective use of aid money.
