I wasn't able to go out -- other than Andy Barr and a couple of people, I wasn't able to go out and work for the House members because I had to win the Senate. And we picked up two seats and nobody talks -- we picked up two Senate seats; we got up to 53. And nobody ever talks about that.”","analysis":"Republicans lost the House to Democrats in 2018. Trump is revising history with these remarks. He barnstormed the country with dozens of rallies for House candidates in tight races, only to see many of them lose as voters rebuked the president and his allies at the ballot box. Republicans already controlled the Senate and lost a seat in 2017 before picking up two in 2018. The result was expected and widely reported at the time.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
