You can now speak your mind and speak it freely...They took away your voice politically and these are the people I want to listen to politically but you weren't allowed to speak. They would lose their tax-exempt status. That's not happening anymore so we got rid of the Johnson Amendment. That's a big thing.”","analysis":"The president sometimes implies that he got rid of the amendment with an executive order, but that isn't the case. Religious leaders are still prohibited from supporting or endorsing political candidates in their official capacities, and continue to be barred from doing so as a condition of their tax-exempt status.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"25021, 20322, 17236, 15932, 15376, 13938, 11490, 10373, 6545, 6659, 4671, 4516, 10420, 1967, 10422, 0831, 10972, 10976","repeated_count":"18","date":"05/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
