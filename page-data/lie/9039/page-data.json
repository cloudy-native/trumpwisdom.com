You look at Strzok and his lover, Lisa Page, and you look at what went on with that whole deal with the insurance policy. The insurance policy just in case she loses. I will tell you, it's a very dishonest group of people.”","analysis":"Trump makes reference to a so-called \"insurance policy\" at the FBI targeting him in case he won. But former FBI agent Peter Strzok has insisted that the reference to an insurance policy in his texts did not mean he or fellow agents were targeting Trump. The IG report mentioned by Trump also found that no improper biases or considerations went into the FBI's decision making in 2016.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25824, 25052, 24910, 24710, 21570, 22332, 22129, 21780, 19708, 19630, 17578, 16933, 16797, 16583, 16045, 16299, 15976, 15946, 15395, 15024, 14831, 15732, 14355, 14387, 14414, 14185, 13909, 15077, 13790, 13612, 12037, 11471, 11480, 11181, 11107, 10744, 10672, 10722, 10330, 10183, 9659, 9481, 9471, 9565, 9231, 9039, 8917, 8806, 8052, 7629, 7239, 5045, 4362, 4531, 2775, 2082","repeated_count":"56","date":"02/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
