He said, 'It's the most incredible thing that we've ever seen. We haven't expanded in 30 years. We haven't done anything remotely like expansion. And we're now expanding and renovating areas of plants that haven't been used in forever.'”","analysis":"Trump has given various versions of this alleged call. Nine days earlier, he has said it had taken place in recent days; now he says it was just two days ago. He sometimes says U.S. Steel would open six or seven facilities. U.S. Steel has not announced the opening of six facilities, nor is there evidence that Trump had a phone call with the head of U.S. Steel. The company has only announced the reopening of two blast furnaces at a plant in Illinois.
