But experts say and satellite imagery indicates North Korea continues to pursue a nuclear program. The Washington Post reported that U.S. spy agencies are seeing signs that North Korea is constructing new missiles at a factory that produced the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.\r\n\r\nIn a Worldwide Threat Assessment issued Jan. 29, the intelligence community concluded: “North Korea retains its WMD capabilities, and the IC continues to assess that it is unlikely to give up all of its WMD stockpiles, delivery systems, and production capabilities. North Korean leaders view nuclear arms as critical to regime survival. . . . We continue to observe activity inconsistent with full denuclearization.”","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"28752, 27898, 27739, 28239, 27155, 26504, 26215, 25331, 25192, 25966, 25899, 25113, 24550, 24551, 24359, 24388, 24459, 24254, 23938, 23787, 23858, 23554, 20954, 22995, 22341, 21520, 21865, 22780, 20676, 20251, 19543, 19491, 18047, 15798, 15799, 14164, 12213, 11680, 11401, 11977, 11006, 11021, 11915, 11443, 11759, 11133, 10051, 9217, 8891, 8861, 8709, 8638, 8474, 8521, 8584, 8395, 8082, 7906","repeated_count":"58","date":"02/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
