He’s heading this whole big thing; he’s not Senate confirmed.”","analysis":"Trump is responding to assertions that he violated the Constitution by appointing the Justice Department’s chief of staff, Matthew G. Whitaker, as acting attorney general. The chief of staff post is not subject to Senate confirmation, unlike the deputy attorney general, who ordinarily would fill the vacancy. But there is no expectation that a special counsel would be subject to Senate confirmation, as he is an “inferior officer” who reports to someone who has been confirmed. (The former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, had recused himself, so Mueller previously had reported to the deputy attorney general.)\r\n\r\nIn other words, Trump’s point is nonsensical.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/14/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
