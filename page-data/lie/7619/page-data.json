Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook.”","analysis":"Trump can keep arguing that the campaign charges are not criminal but the hush-money payments were violations of the law because campaign spending is regulated. You can only accept money under certain conditions, you can only spend that money under specific conditions, and that spending needs to be reported. Trump ignores the fact that American Media Inc. publisher of the National Enquirer, is also involved because it made payments to payments to Karen McDougal. Both Trump Attorney Michael Cohen and AMI have stated under penalty of perjury that the payments were meant to influence the election. AMI told the government that in August 2015 — a year before the McDougal payment — its chief executive, David Pecker, had met with Cohen and an unnamed campaign official (said to be Trump) to offer to help cover up any negative stories that might emerge. It then did so, paying McDougal $150,000 “to suppress the model’s story so as to prevent it from influencing the election,” as the agreement with the government reads. That, by itself, is illegal, but AMI won't be charged under its agreement with the government.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"9222, 9205, 8144, 7753, 7626, 7595, 7596, 7597, 7599, 7600, 7603, 7618, 7619, 7592, 7265, 7296","repeated_count":"16","date":"12/13/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
