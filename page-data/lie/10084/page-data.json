The reason is that the 18 Angry Democrats knew they would all say ‘NO COLLUSION’ and only very good things!”","analysis":"This is a strange claim for Trump to make, since he often notes that he directed many White House aides and advisers to testify freely in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. Mueller interviewed dozens of people who are or have been close to Trump, including friends such as Chris Ruddy and Chris Christie, inner-circle aides such as Hope Hicks, and son-in-law Jared Kushner. Trump often criticizes Mueller's team as 13 (or now, 18) angry Democrats. It's not clear to whom he's referring and what evidence he has, if any. Eleven members of Mueller's team previously had made financial contributions to Democrats' campaigns, including those of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Mueller, a Republican, could not legally take political party affiliation into account in hiring decisions.
