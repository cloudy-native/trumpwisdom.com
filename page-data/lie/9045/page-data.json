Become a very well used word. And a lot of people don't know what it means, but to me it's pretty obvious: We have to get rid of the nukes.”","analysis":"The document signed in June by Trump and Kim Jong Un was remarkably vague, leaving it open to interpretation and debate, compared to previous documents signed by North Korea. The statement said North Korea committed to “work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The phrase is not defined and “toward” is rather weak. In the past, North Korea viewed “denuclearization” to mean the United States removing the nuclear umbrella it provides to Japan and South Korea; there is no indication its definition has changed. Trump’s statement that it means “get rid of the nukes” leaves out facilities, research labs and consistent monitoring and verification. \n","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
