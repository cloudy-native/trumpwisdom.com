You heard about that, right? The old light bulb, which is better. ... The new light, they're terrible. You look terrible. They cost you many, many times more, like four or five times more. And you know, they're considered hazardous waste.”","analysis":"The Trump administration is blocking a rule meant to phase out older light bulbs, saying consumers should have the choice to keep using them. Some newer light bulbs, compact fluorescent, or CFL, bulbs, contain mercury and tend to have harsher color quality. But Trump’s complaint is out of date. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association says that in 2019 CFLs accounted for less than 5 percent of all sales of the classic pear-shaped bulbs. Light-emitting diode, or LED, bulbs are the dominant environmentally friendly technology. They don't have safety risks and often provide comparable light at a cheaper lifetime cost than incandescents. LEDs currently made up more than 70 percent of sales.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"21307, 21182, 16330, 13543, 13733, 12758, 12708","repeated_count":"7","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
