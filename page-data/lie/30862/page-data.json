Right? You're shaking your head. It's amazing what we did, right? Insulin -- you couldn't buy it. It was destroying families. People were going without it. Now it's $35, right? You can't believe it.”","analysis":"In fact, insulin prices remain relatively high for patients despite Trump’s frequent claims that he’s lowering drug prices, at about $300 a vial. As Stat News explained, most patients require multiple vials a month. “His idea to require drug makers include their drug prices in TV ads was struck down in court, and his administration has repeatedly flip-flopped on his idea to eliminate the discounts negotiated between drug prices and middlemen,” Stat News said. “Trump has, however, cut insulin costs for a small subset of seniors. In March, his administration announced a plan to cap what seniors pay at the pharmacy counter at $35 a month. That perk is only available to a fraction of seniors enrolled in certain pricey private insurance plans.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"30862, 30704, 27094, 26437, 26509, 25468, 26005, 25011, 22632, 22624, 22627","repeated_count":"11","date":"12/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
