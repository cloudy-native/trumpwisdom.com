Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!”","analysis":"The audio tape is not entirely clear but in context, it makes more sense for Trump to have said \"I have a good relationship,\" as he made the statement while mentioning good, current relationships with the leaders of China and Japan. Moreover, when the reporters followed and asked if he had communicated with Kim, Trump declined to comment.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/14/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
