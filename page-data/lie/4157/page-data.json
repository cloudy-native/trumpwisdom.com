Apple computer is spending $350 billion on new campuses, on new facilities. They’re bringing back $350 billion. They’re going to actually have — probably, subject to the tax code, about $230 billion come back.”","analysis":"Apple announced a five-year investment plan in January that adds up to $350 billion, but some of this investment would have happened with or without Trump’s tax cut. The tech giant appears to be repatriating $252 billion, not $350 billion or $230 billion, in offshore profit under a provision of Trump’s tax legislation.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"17212, 11152, 9674, 7996, 5993, 6195, 5125, 4575, 4325, 3875, 3869, 4157, 3578, 3857, 4034, 2696, 2672, 2847, 2446, 2376, 2248, 2227, 2346, 2292, 2349, 2210, 2323, 2189, 2149, 2157","repeated_count":"30","date":"07/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
