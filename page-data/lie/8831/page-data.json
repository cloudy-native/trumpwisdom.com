Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called how about a fine? And when I asked President Xi, I said do you have a drug problem? No, no, no, I said you have 1.4 billion people, what do you mean you have no drug problem? No we don't have a drug problem. I said why? Death penalty. We give death penalty to people that sell drugs, end of problem.”","analysis":"A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A-Peoples-War-final.pdf\">2016 Brookings Institution report</a> lays out that “people who smuggle, sell, transport, or manufacture heroin or methamphetamine in an amount greater than 50 grams can be sentenced to 15 years in prison, life imprisonment, or death” in China.\n\nDrug trafficking is one of the few criminal offenses that qualifies for the death penalty, but the idea that China has “no drug problem” because of the tough penalties is wrong. The number of drug addicts officially registered with the Chinese government rose to about 2.5 million in 2013 from just under a million in 2001. First-time offenders are generally sent to drug treatment centers, while repeat offenders are often sent to “education through labor” camps.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"8988, 8878, 8831, 2850","repeated_count":"4","date":"02/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
