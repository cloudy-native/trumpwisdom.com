It’s going to be, I think, 81 percent this quarter, which is a record.  In other administrations, if they stopped it just a little bit, like one, or two, or three percent, they considered that a great thing.  We’re up to almost 80 percent.  We’ll soon be over 80 percent.”","analysis":"Trump's figure reflects the biggest possible decline even though it measures figures from before he became president, and does not use the most up-to-date data. While monthly and annual figures are susceptible to cherry-picking, the decline under his presidency is as low as 8 percent, and the decline in June 2017 compared with June 2016 is 52.6 percent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"1740, 1506, 1759, 1100, 1079, 1010, 0878, 0879, 0898, 0927","repeated_count":"10","date":"08/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
