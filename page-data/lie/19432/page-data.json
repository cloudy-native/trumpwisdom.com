And, as you know, they made a statement on June -- on January 14th, I guess it was, that there was no human-to-human transmission. Well, there was. They probably made that statement in the second or third week of December, in addition, but they made it very powerfully on January 14th.”","analysis":"The WHO did not make this statement on any date. But the agency, in a Jan. 14 tweet, said China was reporting that it had \"found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in #Wuhan.” As FactCheck.org <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/factchecking-trumps-attack-on-the-who/\">put it</a>, \"Lack of evidence, especially of 'preliminary' results, does not mean the WHO was saying the novel coronavirus could not be spread between people. The same day as the tweet, the WHO cautioned that there might be some human-to-human transmission of the virus among family members in China.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
