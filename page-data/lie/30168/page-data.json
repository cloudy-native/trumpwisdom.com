You know that they own him, they control him and they know he will always do their bidding. And when he raises three hundred million dollars for this campaign in a short period of time, ask him what deals did you have to make? Because I would be the greatest fundraiser of all time. I can call the Wall Street guys. I know them all. I could say send me 25 million dollars immediately, please. Yes, sir, Mr. President, I will. But, you know, once you do that, you're totally compromised. You can't do anything properly once you do that. And I say, I don't want to do that. And we we did very well with the fundraising stuff, but a lot of it came in small donations.”","analysis":"Without evidence, Trump suggests Biden is guilty of corruption because he is raising so much more money than the president. But Biden gathered a lot of donations from small donors too. \"Biden ultimately beat out Trump with both large donors and smaller contributors giving $200 or less,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2020/11/biden-wins/\">OpenSecrets.org reported</a>. \"He also brought in an unprecedented amount of donations from women donors. Nearly 1.9 million women donated to Biden’s campaign — compared to roughly 505,000 for Trump — accounting for 47 percent of his total fundraising.\" Sometimes, Trump spins a tale about he could easily raise millions of dollars with a single phone call to a corporate executive -- transactions that would violate campaign finance limits.
