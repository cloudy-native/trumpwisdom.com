The CPI for prescription drugs in 2018 fell for the first time in 46 years. But that’s only when measuring January-to-December years, which is somewhat arbitrary. The president’s record shrinks to five-and-a-half years when looking at the most recent 12-month decline, for the 12-month period that ended July 2013. Experts say the CPI for prescription drugs fails to account for rebates, which can be substantial, and may be giving a skewed picture because of recent market shifts toward generics and electronic payments by third parties. A range of studies we found shows that drug prices have not declined, especially when it comes to branded drugs. On the other hand, the 2 percent decline for the year ended June 30 is the largest on record for any 12-month period in the CPI data, which goes back to 1970.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"27650, 27750, 27527, 23514, 21054, 22922, 21847, 22821, 21043, 21774, 22750, 21038, 21034, 21719, 22622, 18065, 17917, 17334, 17272, 16474, 16318, 16007, 14825, 15679, 14679, 15110, 13016, 13639, 13723, 12923, 13098, 12439, 11613, 12136, 12115, 11997, 11806, 11736","repeated_count":"38","date":"08/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
