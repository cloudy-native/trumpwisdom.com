For example, Fiat Chrysler's plan to invest $1 billion for a factory in Michigan had been in the works for more than a year and had nothing to do with Trump. As for Foxconn, the company considered investing in U.S.-based facilities since 2014, though its initial plans to invest in Pennsylvania didn't pan out. Trump keeps celebrating the company's decision, but the Wisconsin Legislature had not yet approved the $3 billion incentives package amid concerns from taxpayers.
