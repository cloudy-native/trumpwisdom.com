As part of its coronavirus response, New Jersey held all-mail elections for the first time that day. The state attorney general later announced that a sitting councilman, a former councilman and two others (all Democrats) had been charged with voter fraud after postal inspectors found hundreds of ballots stuffed in a Paterson mailbox. The Passaic County Board of Elections rejected 3,190 ballots, about 19 percent of the mail-in ballots cast in Paterson’s race. The question is how many were connected to the fraud allegations. Trump says all of them were corrupted, but a county elections official told the Paterson Press that 2,300 ballots were rejected as “part of the normal process,” meaning they were disqualified for common reasons such as signature mismatches or arriving after the deadline. Doing the math, that means fewer than 5 percent of the 16,747 ballots cast in that election can be linked to the fraud allegations. What would that look like in context? In an analysis of 31 local elections held the same day, New Jersey Spotlight found that 9.6 percent of ballots were rejected. “Most commonly, officials did not count ballots because the signature on the ballot did not match the one on file, the ballot arrived too late or the required certificate was not enclosed,” New Jersey Spotlight reported.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"26360, 26039, 25120, 24722, 24497, 24050, 23431, 23229, 23281, 23138, 22021, 22044, 22393, 20969, 21017, 22487, 23012, 23031, 23033, 22273, 22302, 22958, 21724, 22759, 22766, 22863, 21750, 22641, 21518, 22563, 21132","repeated_count":"31","date":"07/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
