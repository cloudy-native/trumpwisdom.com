And I told you, the President of South Korea, President Moon, called me to congratulate me on testing. And we did more tests than any other country anywhere in the world. And I think they told me yesterday a number -- if you add up the rest of the world, we've done more testing.”","analysis":"Trump’s bravado is ridiculously wrong. The rest of the world combined had conducted about five times more tests. As we have repeatedly noted, what matters is the number of tests per million people. The per-million testing rate in April and May for the United States was the lowest of the top six countries that had the most tests.
