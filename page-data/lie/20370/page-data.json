I asked for his letter of resignation, & felt great about it. His nickname was ‘Chaos’, which I didn't like, & changed to ‘Mad Dog’... His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom ‘brought home the bacon’. I didn't like his ‘leadership’ style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!”","analysis":"Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned, bluntly telling Trump in a letter that he disagreed on several foreign policy issues and that he should have a defense secretary better aligned with his views. Mattis's resignation came after Trump abruptly announced a decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a plan he has since walked back after Mattis's departure. Trump did not coin Mattis's nickname, \"Mad Dog.\" Mattis said at his confirmation hearing in the Senate that the press gave him that nickname, which he considered inaccurate, for some remarks he made.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30608, 24193, 24252, 19850, 20370, 8464, 8537, 7938","repeated_count":"8","date":"06/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
