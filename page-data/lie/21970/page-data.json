The FDA has issued an emergency use authorization -- and that's such a powerful term: emergency use authorization -- for a treatment known as convalescent plasma. This is a powerful therapy that transfuses very, very strong antibodies from the blood of recovered patients to help treat patients battling a current infection. It's had an incredible rate of success....Through this study, over 100,000 Americans have already enrolled to receive this treatment, and it has proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent. It's a tremendous number..”","analysis":"Trump hyped the treatment of convalescent plasma, claiming it had been proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent,  even though the therapy has not yet been shown to be effective for covid-19. The 35 percent figure was from a subset of patients, comparing those who received plasma with a high concentration of antibodies to those who received a low concentration.   The study that produced the figure had not yet been peer-reviewed and was not a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment to a placebo. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn later apologized for mischaracterizing the results, but Trump did not and kept touting the figure.
