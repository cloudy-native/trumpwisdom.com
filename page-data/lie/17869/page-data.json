Remember, it was a big thing -- in front of 25,000 people. 'Russia if you're ...' It was all said in a joke. They cut it off right at the end so that you don't then see the laughter, the joke. And they said, 'He asked. He asked for help.' Right? 'Russia, if you're listening ...' A very famous -- they cut that thing so quick at the end because they didn't want to hear the laughter in the place and me laughing. It was just 'boom.'”","analysis":"Many things are wrong in this retelling. Trump made his 2016 \"Russia, if you're listening\" request -- for help obtaining deleted Hillary Clinton emails -- at a news conference, not an event with \"25,000 people.\" He did not laugh when he said, he appeared serious and one cannot detect any laughter in the room. News organizations displayed the video correctly without deceptively editing.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
