Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trumps-super-fast-and-super-duper-missile-confusion-2020-5\">told Business Insider</a> that Trump's mention of speeds that were faster could have been in reference to the estimated speeds of the HGVs, which range from at least Mach 5 to around Mach 20. But Trump's suggestion that HGVs are faster than existing missiles is false and reflects a misunderstanding of their capabilities, Reif said. \"The reported speed of these weapons (and hypersonic cruise missiles, which are slower than HGVs) are indeed faster than existing conventionally armed US air- and sea-delivered missiles such as the [Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile] and Tomahawk cruise missiles, which fly at subsonic speeds,\" Reif said. \"But they are not faster than US nuclear-armed intercontinental-range ballistic missiles. These missiles reach hypersonic speeds in excess of Mach 20.\" He added: \"Trump is well known for serving up nonsensical word salads, and this was no exception.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30941, 30303, 30534, 29541, 29712, 29000, 27998, 27689, 27850, 27911, 27733, 28246, 27480, 27341, 27513, 24762","repeated_count":"16","date":"10/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
