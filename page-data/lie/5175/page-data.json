You went from 16 to 64.\" We did a great job. \"And then you went from 64 to 3000? How did that happen.\" And they couldn't explain it. And if you read that report, it's not explainable.”","analysis":"In August, George Washington University released its report, estimating excess deaths at between 2,658 and 3,290, with a midpoint of 2,975, in the six months after the storm made landfall. The investigation, based on actual death certificates, compared the number of deaths with typical death rates, adjusting for many variables, including the mass exodus from the island in the aftermath of the storm. Puerto Rico has accepted this as the official death toll. Other studies that examined a shorter time period, found between 1,000-1,200 people died as a result of the storm.
