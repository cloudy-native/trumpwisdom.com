The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!”","analysis":"Trump repeatedly played down the threat of the novel coronavirus in the early days of the pandemic.Early on in the coronavirus crisis, he kept bragging the United States had few cases but the virus was already spreading through the United States when Trump, following the lead of other countries, banned non-U.S. citizens from entering the United States from China. But the testing criteria set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were extremely narrow: Only those with recent travel to China or those who had come into contact with a confirmed infection would be tested. Before Trump acted, Italy took even stronger action -- banning all flights to and from China. Trump's action included 11 exemptions and allowed flights to to keep going. The New York Times estimated nearly 40,000 people traveled from China to the United States in the two months after Trump imposed restrictions on such travel -- and at least 430,000 people have arrived in the United States on direct flights from China before the restrictions. While Trump often suggests the United States imposed the first ban, dozens of countries acted before the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
