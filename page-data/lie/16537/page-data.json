It’s a hazardous waste. When that bulb ends, you're supposed to take it to a certain dump and gingerly put it in because it’s loaded up with gasses.”","analysis":"Some newer light bulbs, compact fluorescent, or CFL, bulbs, contain mercury and tend to have harsher color quality. But Trump’s complaint is out of date. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association says that in 2019 CFLs accounted for less than 5 percent of all sales of the classic pear-shaped bulbs. Light-emitting diode, or LED, bulbs are the dominant environmentally friendly technology. They don't have safety risks and often provide comparable light at a cheaper lifetime cost than incandescents. LEDs currently made up more than 70 percent of sales. Stores such as Lowe's and Home Depot take these discarded light bulbs, obviating the need to dispose of them at a dump.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
