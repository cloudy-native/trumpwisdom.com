Have they illegally destroyed ballots in Fulton County?”","analysis":"State election officials have rejected these claims as bogus. Georgia elections official Gabriel Sterling said Trump was wrong to claim that thousands of people voted without being registered. “You can't do it. There cannot be a ballot issued to you, there’s no way to tie it back to you, there’s nowhere for them to have a name to correspond back to unless they’re registered voters. So that number is zero.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
