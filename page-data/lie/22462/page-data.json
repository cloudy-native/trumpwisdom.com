I mean this is a city. This is a real city and they took over a large portion of that city and they knew we were going in the following day. They knew it. So they sent their police in and it was like nobody ever gave up so easily as those characters. But they're radical left anarchists.”","analysis":"Trump exaggerates about Seattle's Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ). Mayor Jenny Durkan described as \"four blocks in Seattle that is more like a block party atmosphere. It's not an armed takeover. It's not a military junta. We will make sure that we will restore this but we have block parties and the like in this part of Seattle all the time ... there is no threat right now to the public.\" CHAZ was established on June 8 and cleared of occupants by police on July 1 after some violence occurred. But that was not the case at the time of these remarks. No evidence of Antifa involvement emerged.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
