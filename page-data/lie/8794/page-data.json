It comes through -- the big loads come through the border, where you don't have wall, where they can drive a truck, a big truck, loaded up with drugs or loaded up with this thing called a ‘human cargo.’ Human cargo. These are traffickers. These are the worst people on Earth. And they don't come through the ports of entry with people in the back of a car tied up.”","analysis":"This is far from reality. Trump often talks about people being bound and gagged as they are smuggled into the United States, but experts say they have no idea what he's talking about and that most cases of human trafficking at the border happen at legal ports of entry. As for drug smuggling, the numbers don't lie: The arm of the DHS that works at ports of entry seized 4,813 pounds of heroin in the first 11 months of fiscal 2018, compared with the 532 pounds seized by Border Patrol. Seven times as much cocaine was seized at ports of entry then between them, as well. Marijuana is the only drug that is seized more often between ports of entry.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31475, 21854, 21391, 21437, 19398, 19152, 18027, 16849, 12684, 11032, 10489, 10262, 10098, 9897, 9778, 9811, 9611, 9240, 8971, 8983, 8937, 8820, 8845, 8794, 8747, 8448, 8531, 8482, 8491, 8506, 8386, 8023, 7789, 7795, 8234, 8242, 8248, 8039, 8093, 7769, 8071, 7755, 7975, 7954, 7858, 7712, 7697, 7702, 7681, 7684, 7653, 7656, 7480, 7575, 7264, 7119, 7156, 6811, 6906, 6601, 6766, 7082, 5472, 4581, 3451, 3490, 3845, 3175, 2834, 2748, 2641, 2630, 2922, 2598, 2652, 2411, 2335, 2099, 2121, 2056, 2066, 2052, 2094, 2103, 1998, 2000, 2004, 1994, 1952, 1775, 1572, 1407, 1414, 1458, 1449, 1478, 1395, 1194, 1138, 1137, 1034, 1136","repeated_count":"102","date":"02/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
