He has the circles. You know the little circles? Which I love. The guy that does the circles, is very good, very neat. I'm a perfectionist. Nice, big, beautiful, yellow. They're very far apart, because he can't get any people. There's only five of 'em, and they have a hard time filling 'em up.”","analysis":"Biden campaign rallies are purposely smaller because he and his surrogates are following federal guidelines designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus; Trump consistently ignores the guidelines and puts his supporters at risk. Trump also wildly overestimates the size of his crowds.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31147, 30336, 30360, 29757, 29860, 29301, 29416, 29599, 29489, 29560, 29938, 30126, 28889, 28660, 28524, 28403, 28989, 29018, 28093, 28118, 28266, 27932, 27697, 27863, 27915, 27926, 27746, 26816, 26725, 27101, 27176, 25767, 25712, 25533, 25632, 25634, 25020","repeated_count":"37","date":"10/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
