The stock market on a daily basis is hitting an all-time high.”","analysis":"Trump appears to referring to the fact that the unemployment rate was 4.4 percent in June, which is a 16-year low. (This was a slight increase from 4.3 percent in May.) The unemployment rate was 4.8 percent in January, when Trump took office — and when he campaigned for president he routinely said the unemployment numbers were phony and were actually as high as 42 percent. (The actual jobs report was nothing special, with fewer jobs created than in June 2016.) As we noted, during the campaign Trump often said the stock market was in “a big, fat, ugly bubble.” Now he celebrates its continued rise.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"9212, 7967, 2356, 2342, 2128, 2138, 2140, 2045, 2003, 2001, 1980, 2002, 1986, 1971, 1844, 1941, 1926, 1906, 1911, 1813, 1828, 1764, 1829, 1831, 1836, 1843, 1802, 1751, 1722, 1724, 1725, 1687, 1690, 1733, 1735, 1741, 1742, 1653, 1658, 1660, 1648, 1628, 1593, 1552, 1594, 1602, 1607, 1538, 1616, 1431, 1408, 1512, 1444, 1475, 1362, 1322, 1323, 1352, 1354, 1359, 1326, 1302, 1340, 1344, 1288, 1263, 1256, 1180, 1205, 1147, 1123, 1114, 1091, 1051, 0999, 0994, 0987, 0973, 1025, 0997, 0970, 0940, 0951, 0934, 0965, 0885, 0887, 0827, 0820, 0821, 0851, 0753, 0823, 0192, 0168, 0125, 0088, 0109","repeated_count":"98","date":"07/24/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
