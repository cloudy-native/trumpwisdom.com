Different names-over 100 M...ut should be much higher than that if Twitter wasn’t playing their political games.”","analysis":"Twitter denies that Trump, as a Republican, is treated any differently than other users. There is no evidence -- but lots of conspiracy theories -- that Twitter is slanted against conservative voices. Twitter long has explained that follower figures fluctuate as the company takes action to remove fraudulent spam accounts.
