We can't get them through Chuck Schumer and the group -- we have 360 people that want to join the administration -- ambassadors and lawyers and lots of other people. We cannot get them approved because -- I guess you could call it obstruction. If you think about it, it's pure obstruction. … We need lawyers. We need ambassadors. We need all these 360 people that the Democrats won't approve.”","analysis":"Republicans control the Senate and could confirm any pending nominee with a simple majority. In other words, Trump's pending nominees could be confirmed without Democratic votes. Democrats have tools to delay the process, but they cannot block it, and Trump has been slow to name people to many posts. It's also doubtful that 360 people are awaiting confirmation.
