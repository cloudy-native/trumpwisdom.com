We're defending the world, we're defending wealthy countries that can well afford to pay us.

More than 70 percent of the total is spent in Japan, Germany and South Korea, where most U.S. troops abroad are permanently stationed. The U.S. receives various forms of compensation from the host countries, from rent-free real estate where the bases are located to actual cash payments meant to offset U.S. costs. Japan, for instance, pays about $2 billion a year. While not all of the money is fully reimbursed, U.S. security is enhanced by the forward deployment of U.S. forces.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
