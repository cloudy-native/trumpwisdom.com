The judge found that, through an elaborate fraud, hundreds of residents were encouraged to vote by absentee ballot even though they had no legal reason to. But this was an exceedingly rare case of absentee-ballot fraud and the judge's remedy -- tossing out all absentee ballots -- was considered unusual at the time. Trump was never able to prove to any court that the same thing had happened to him more than a quarter century after this incident.
