Members of Congress also did not get \"bailouts\" when they were moved onto the Obamacare exchanges. The president either doesn’t understand the process or is being purposely misleading.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/29/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
