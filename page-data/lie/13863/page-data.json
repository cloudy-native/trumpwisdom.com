Under Obama, all Iraqi cities (with exception of western half of Mosul) held by ISIS—such as eastern Mosul, Fallujah, Ramadi, Tikrit—were retaken by end of his term, as was much of northeastern strip of Syria along Turkish border. The basic plan of attack in 2017 was also developed under Obama, though Trump sped up the tempo by changing the rules of engagement. Plus, the loss of physical territory does not mean the group is defeated. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/s_2018_770.pdf\">Reports</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/islamic-state-and-persistent-threat-extremism-iraq\">estimate</a> that 20,000 to 30,000 ISIS militants may remain in Iraq and Syria, opposed to 700 when the U.S. last withdrew. U.S. Central Command warns “absent sustained [counterterrorism] pressure, ISIS could likely resurge in Syria within six to twelve months and regain limited territory.” Thus while the caliphate has been eliminated, ISIS remains a threat.

The reduction of U.S. forces has decreased the support available for Syrian partner forces at a time when their forces need more training and equipping to respond to the ISIS resurgence.” Yet Trump often says he's gotten rid of ISIS.
