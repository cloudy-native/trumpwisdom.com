That’s not correct. Mueller was appointed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2001-title28-vol2/pdf/CFR-2001-title28-vol2-part600.pdf\">under federal regulations</a> that say the special counsel could only be fired by the attorney general. Because Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, had recused himself from the investigation, the responsibility fell to Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. The regulations further state the special counsel could be removed only “for misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of Departmental policies.” In other words, Trump could have gotten rid of Mueller only if he ordered Rosenstein to fire Mueller — and if Rosenstein complied. (It’s possible Trump meant that he did not need to go through the White House counsel to contact Rosenstein.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
