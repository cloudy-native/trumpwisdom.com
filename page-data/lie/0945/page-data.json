You go back a thousand years where you think of human trafficking, you go back 500 years, 200 years, 100 years. Human trafficking they say -- think of it, but they do -- human trafficking is worse now maybe than it’s ever been in the history of this world.”","analysis":"Though human trafficking is a major issue in some regions of the world, experts and available evidence indicate trafficking for sexual exploitation is not a serious problem in the United States. A recent study funded by the Justice Department concluded the total number of juveniles in the sex trade in the United States was about 9,000 to 10,000. There is no evidence that the situation is the worst it has ever been in world history.
