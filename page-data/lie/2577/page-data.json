How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!”","analysis":"The question of McCabe’s wife’s political activities emerged during the campaign, and Trump constantly has gotten the details incorrect. The timeline shows any connection to Hillary Clinton is pretty thin, although McCabe claims that Trump brought up his wife in almost every conversation. On March 12, 2015, Jill McCabe, a hospital physician, announced her candidacy for the Virginia Senate. The political action committee of then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D), a close Clinton ally, gave $452,500 to McCabe, and the state Democratic Party gave her campaign $207,788. That was about one-third of the $1.8 million budget for her campaign.Meanwhile, on March 2, 2015, the New York Times first reported on Clinton’s email server setup while she was secretary of state. At the time, Andrew McCabe was running the FBI’s field office in Washington.In July 2015, the FBI opened a criminal investigation of Clinton’s server. The D.C. field office provided resources and personnel to the email inquiry. In September, Andrew McCabe moved to the FBI’s headquarters, taking the No. 3 position. In November 2015, Jill McCabe lost her race. Three months later, in February, Andrew McCabe became the FBI’s deputy director and part of an executive team overseeing the Clinton email investigation. In any case, it’s hard to see how McAuliffe would know that the husband of someone he was supporting in a Virginia legislative race was going to be promoted months later.\r\n\r","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"25374, 24024, 23775, 12038, 9580, 8894, 8807, 6076, 4334, 3129, 2987, 2942, 2728, 2577, 2321, 1940, 1944, 1678, 0929, 0866, 0830","repeated_count":"21","date":"03/17/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
