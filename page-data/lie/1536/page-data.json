We have, in my estimation, $4 trillion that will come pouring back into our country, that will be put to work and it will be spent by our companies that could never get the money back for many years.”","analysis":"There are no official, current numbers on the profits held overseas by U.S. companies, just estimates. The White House would not respond to a query on where Trump is getting these numbers, but his high-end figure appears to be an exaggeration. The Internal Revenue Service in 2012 said the figure was $2.3 trillion, and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it had risen to $2.6 trillion in 2015. There are other estimates as well, but none top $2.8 trillion.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"4324, 4241, 3683, 3870, 2313, 2229, 2332, 2030, 2044, 1818, 1767, 1884, 1719, 1673, 1669, 1561, 1610, 1623, 1536, 1430, 1415, 1454, 1410, 1523, 1358, 1310, 1215, 1133, 1144, 1109, 1110","repeated_count":"31","date":"11/01/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
