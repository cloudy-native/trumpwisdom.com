So Trump's number is inflated. More broadly, while the issue is sharply debated, it unclear the extent to which the governor’s policy -- directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having covid-19 -- was responsible for nursing home COVID-19 deaths.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28301, 26708, 27403, 26234, 24985, 23341, 23285, 23300, 23123, 21534","repeated_count":"10","date":"09/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
