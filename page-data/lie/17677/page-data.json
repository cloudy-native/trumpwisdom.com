It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.”","analysis":"Trump was looking for scapegoats to excuse his administration’s slow efforts to expand testing. But he cannot blame Obama. There was no Obama rule, simply “guidance” documents concerning laboratory-developed tests from 2014 that never took effect and were withdrawn before Trump took office. The administration suggested, without evidence, that labs were confused because of previous regulatory actions by the Obama administration. But Trump had been president for three years and his administration already had been working with Congress on legislation concerning lab tests. If there was confusion by labs, the administration could have easily taken the action on allowing emergency authorization to create coronavirus tests sooner than it did.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"20837, 17906, 17931, 17724, 17956, 17706, 17702, 17980, 17668, 17677, 17057, 17660, 17987, 17637","repeated_count":"14","date":"03/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
