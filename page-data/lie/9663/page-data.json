The president appears to be getting the 38 percent figure from the high the index achieved in June 2016, but it fell sharply before Trump became president or any of his tariffs were implemented. U.S. stocks had been rising for years before Trump became president and there is little evidence his tariffs have fueled a continued rise. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 30 percent from the time Trump took office to the time he made these remarks. The S&P 500 was up roughly 20 percent and the Nasdaq composite index was up around 30 percent. Measuring from the 2016 election does not get him to 50 percent, either.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"14261, 11023, 10682, 10406, 9663, 9387, 8832, 8137, 8080, 6693","repeated_count":"10","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
