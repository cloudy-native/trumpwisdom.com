They come over and they serve you, and they have a mask. And I saw it the other day where they were serving me, and they're playing with the mask -- I'm not blaming them -- I'm just saying what happens. They're playing with the mask, so the mask is over, and they're touching it, and then they're touching the plate.”","analysis":"This makes no sense. The coronavirus is known for its airborne transmission. Why would any waiter increase their chances of exposure and their patrons' by refusing a mask? Even in the unusual scenario Trump describes, a mask would be better than no mask.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
