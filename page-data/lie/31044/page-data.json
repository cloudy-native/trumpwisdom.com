For example, among the more than 5,000 pages in this bill, which nobody in Congress has read because of its length and complexity, it's called the COVID Relief Bill but it has almost nothing to do with COVID. This bill contains $85.5 million for assistance to Cambodia, $134 million to Burma, $1.3 billion for Egypt and the Egyptian military, which will go out and buy almost exclusively Russian military equipment. $25 million for democracy and gender programs in Pakistan, $505 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. $40 million for the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., which is not even open for business, $1 billion for the Smithsonian, and an additional $154 million for the National Gallery of Art. Likewise, these facilities are essentially not open. $7 million for reef fish management, $25 million to combat asian carp, $2.5 million to count the number of amberjack fish in the Gulf of Mexico, a provision to promote the breeding of fish in Federal hatcheries. $3 million in poultry production technology, $2 million to research the impact of downed trees, $566 million for construction projects at the FBI.‚Äù","analysis":"This is a disingenuous complaint and suggests that Trump has barely bothered to understand the bill. The covid relief package  was combined with remaining annual spending bills. Many of these line items cited by Trump were exactly what he requested in his own budget. For instance, the annual payment to Egypt that had been every federal budget since 1987, at this exact amount, as a result of the Camp David accords. (And Egypt will spend it on U.S. military equipment.)
