It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the 'best job market in 50 years, and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers. Big wage gains.'”","analysis":"Trump purports to quote an economist who is a fan of his policies. But 2018 did not have a lowest unemployment rate for all workers, and Moore in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/dec/30/2018-the-year-of-the-worker/\">his Washington Times article</a> is careful to note that the unemployment rate for blacks and Hispanics is the lowest in almost five decades, which is how long such statistics have been produced. The unemployment rate is the lowest since 1969. Wages grew at an annual rate of 3.1% in November, a nine-year high. Wages began a steady increase in 2014 but for many workers were stagnant in 2017, Trump’s first year in office.
