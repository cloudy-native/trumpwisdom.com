And there were thousands of people outside just like there are right now. We had 69,000 people sign up to come in. What does this place hold? Like 10,000 or 12,000 or whatever. Whatever it holds. We set the record.”","analysis":"The record attendance at Green Bay's Resch Center was 10,414 when Elton John was there in 2003, according to the Green Bay Press Gazette. The Resch Center has an official capacity of 9,877 but it can grow according to layout.  The Secret Service said only the first 10,000 people would be allowed inside for Trump's rally, however, so it's unlikely he broke Elton John's record.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30333, 30165, 30318, 29414, 28355, 28722, 29019, 27930, 27696, 27032, 26742, 26792, 26724, 27263, 26902, 27177, 25959, 25981, 25783, 25085, 23634, 21885, 21762, 19473, 18482, 18066, 18116, 18388, 17422, 17471, 18337, 17282, 17356, 16500, 16455, 16270, 16277, 16321, 14959, 14323, 14653, 15059, 15092, 13783, 13238, 12469, 12449, 12381, 11602, 11671, 12091, 12108, 12020, 12021, 11930, 11873, 11874, 11165, 11768, 11157, 10588, 10628, 10696, 10544, 10854, 10225, 9499, 9091, 9093, 9094, 9153, 8286, 8170, 7012, 7013, 7434, 7460, 6704, 6705, 6708, 6868, 6944, 7095, 6662, 6524, 6758, 6217, 6247, 6328, 6336, 6346, 6408, 6169, 5488, 5871, 5889, 5446, 5559, 6064, 5076, 5560, 5575, 5502, 5507, 5189, 5235, 5236, 5237, 5179, 5180","repeated_count":"110","date":"04/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
