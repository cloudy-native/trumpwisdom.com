Trump is referring to a February <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/286277/high-confidence-government-handle-coronavirus.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> that found 77 percent of Americans are very or somewhat confident in the government’s ability to handle a Coronavirus outbreak. It did not ask about Trump specifically. Moreover, the poll was released when the country had few known cases and no known deaths from cover-19. A  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3657\">Quinnipiac Poll</a> taken around the time of this comment found only 43 percent of Americans approved of how the president was handling the response. That's lower than any of the metrics for previous epidemics listed in the original Gallup poll.
