For fiscal 2020, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ice.gov/remove/statistics\">reported</a> 103,603 administrative arrests, down 28 percent from 2019. That’s far from half a million. ICE added that 90 percent of the administrative arrests involved people with a prior conviction, and the agency said it contributed to 4,360 criminal arrests in 2020. Trump often suggests, as in these remarks, that everyone arrested by ICE has committed a violent crime, “like murder,” but many have only immigration or nonviolent offenses on their records.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/12/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
