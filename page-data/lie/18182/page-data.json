The United States is now, by far, the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far. It's not even close. While many European countries struggle with crippling energy costs, the American energy revolution is saving American families $2,500 every year in lowering electric bills and numbers that people said couldn't happen, and also, very importantly, prices at the pump. We've been so successful that the United States no longer needs to import energy from hostile nations.”","analysis":"The United States is not energy-independent; it continues to import millions of barrels of oil per day, including from Persian Gulf countries and Russia. Trump often takes credit for an energy boom that began under the Obama administration. We couldn't verify or find experts who would corroborate his estimate of $2,500 in savings from lower electric bills.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/21/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
