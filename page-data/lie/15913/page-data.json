Trump is citing a Bureau of Labor Statistics database set known as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cew/\">Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages</a>. The data shows that United States gained almost 10,000 additional \"manufacturing establishments\" between the first quarter of 2017 through the first quarter of 2019; the number increased to above 12,000 in the second quarter of 2019. (There was a gain of 10,000 also in Obama's second term.) But more than 80 percent of these \"manufacturing establishments\" employ five or fewer people. The BLS <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag31-33.htm\">considers any establishment</a> \"engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products,\" so that also means establishments \"that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"25688, 22931, 22838, 22561, 21076, 20239, 16892, 16842, 16181, 15855, 15881, 15913, 15924, 15918, 15951","repeated_count":"15","date":"11/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
