For example, in New Jersey, former governor Chris Christie, a Republican allied with Trump, led a coalition to abolish cash bail and replace it with a point-based system that assesses risk based on the nature of the charges, the defendant’s prior record and the risk to the public.\n\nThe unity task force for Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) simply says, “Poverty is not a crime, and it should not be treated as one. Democrats support eliminating the use of cash bail and believe no one should be imprisoned merely for failing to pay fines or fees.” That’s the same argument Christie would make.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"30128, 28940, 28824, 27597, 27115, 27236, 24404, 23985, 22096, 22396, 20948, 22997, 22919, 22937, 22171, 22205, 22236, 22817, 22844, 21242, 21511, 21195, 21114","repeated_count":"23","date":"08/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
