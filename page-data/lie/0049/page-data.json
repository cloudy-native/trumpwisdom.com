They can't borrow money. They just can't get any money because the banks just won't let them borrow it because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.”","analysis":"If Trump were just talking about all business loans, his statement would be wrong. Commercial lending is at record highs. The picture is murkier if he were referring only to small businesses, as the White House claims. Trump specifically mentioned the “rules and regulations” of Dodd-Frank. The law was not intended to target community banks, and it carved out many exemptions. But regulatory oversight appears to have become tougher, so a case could be made that the post-Dodd-Frank regulatory environment made it harder for community banks to make small-business loans.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"2030","repeated_count":"1","date":"02/03/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
