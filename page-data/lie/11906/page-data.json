It was not doing what it was supposed to do. Many bad things were taking place. And, most importantly, it was so short-term that, within a very short number of years, they would be able to make nuclear weapons.”","analysis":"The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the Iran nuclear deal is formally known, actually bars Iran from ever seeking, developing or acquiring nuclear weapons; that element of the deal does not expire.
