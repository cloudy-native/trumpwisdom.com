We've been working on this for a long time. I've been talking about it with Kayleigh for a long time, right? So now a governor like Ron DeSantis of Florida -- who is doing a great job -- or our great governor of Ohio or a great governor of any state can call up and buy the drugs directly from Canada at sometimes 50 percent less. So we'll be buying from Canada.”","analysis":"As part of re-election campaign, Trump issued a rule in July that pushed to allow such importation and the Department of Health and Human Services issued in a final rule in late September establishing a path for states and certain other entities to set up drug importation programs.

Canadian health minister Patty Hajdu in late November <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/30/politics/canada-trump-prescription-drug-imports/index.html\">announced</a> new measures to protect the country's drug supply from bulk importations that could worsen drug shortages.
