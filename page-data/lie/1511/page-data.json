And I’ll say, how are you doing? ‘Oh, don’t know, don’t know, not well, Mr. President, not well.’ I said, well, what’s the problem? ‘Oh, GDP 9 percent, not well.’ And I’m saying to myself, here we are at like 1 percent, dying, and they’re at 9 percent and they’re unhappy. So, you know, and these are like countries, you know, fairly large, like 300 million people.”","analysis":"Trump is making a major economic error in comparing the GDP of a developed country to a developing one. By a process of elimination, it is possible the prime minister of India is the world leader who is unhappy with 7 percent growth rate. (He’s probably even unhappier now that growth appears to be slowing.) Certainly, Trump has expressed interest in rivaling India’s growth. That’s one world leader. But the world leader who Trump claims is unhappy with 8 percent growth appears to be a phantom. Of the 58 heads of state he’s met or spoke with since taking office, not one can claim 9 percent GDP growth.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"1507, 1510","repeated_count":"2","date":"07/25/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
