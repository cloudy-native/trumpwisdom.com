It's built about 20 years ahead of budget and schedule. I would say we're probably about 20 years -- you know that story, I'm not going to tell it -- but we built it real fast. We have the best location. They're all looking for a location. And a friend of mine, the ambassador to Israel, said, oh, but we already have the best piece of land in all of Israel. Best piece of land in Jerusalem. And we have a building on it. Let's renovate it. So instead of spending $1.2 billion, we spent $400,000. That was a sale.”","analysis":"The U.S. spent about $400,000 to upgrade a consular facility and to relabel it an embassy. But it also signed a contract more than $20 million on security upgrades for the facility, so the initial cost is 100 times more than Trump’s claim. Moreover, this is only a temporary facility; a major embassy generally costs between $500 million and $1 billion.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"09/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
