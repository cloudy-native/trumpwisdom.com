Remember that: Before I got here, it was heading south. A lot of people say, 'Oh, gee, how are we doing?' It was going bad. If you go back 15 years, soybeans were more expensive 15 years ago than when I got into office. They were less. Now they're up nearly $14 billion.”","analysis":"Trump crams a lot of agriculture statistics into a few sentences to spin a misleading tale. From FY 2014 to FY 2016, U.S. agricultural exports <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/220767/total-value-of-us-agricultural-exports-since-2000/\">declined $22.7 billion<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2531/soybean-prices-historical-chart-data\">. The U.S. Department of Agriculture attributed the 2015 dip to a confluence of factors including “lower commodity prices, erosion of U.S. competitiveness due to the strong dollar, diminishing foreign demand due to slower economic growth, especially in China, and trade restrictions.” As for soybean prices, when Trump took office at the end of January 2017, soybean prices <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/k35694332/7h149s08f/qz20sv884/CropValuSu-02-23-2018.pdf\">were</a> between $10.20 and $10.70 per bushel. In January 2002, 15 years before Trump took office, soybean prices were between $4.20 and $4.30 per bushel. So they were not more expensive. Plus, a 2018 USDA {summary of crop values</a> showed soybean values increased $300 million during Trump’s first year in office —not $14 billion as he claimed. Regardless, commodity prices change daily and are influenced by a wide variety of factors ranging from weather to demand.
