What's the big deal?' So I got a transcript. I reviewed it. I actually went out and reviewed a clip of an answer that I gave, and I realized that there is need for some clarification. It should have been obvious -- I thought it would be obvious -- but I would like to clarify, just in case it wasn't. In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn't.’ The sentence should have been: I don't see any reason why I wouldn't -- or why it wouldn't be Russia. So just to repeat it, I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn't.’ … the sentence should have been: I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be Russia. Sort of a double negative. So you can put that in, and I think that probably clarifies things pretty good by itself.”","analysis":"After meeting with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16, Trump publicly discredited the U.S. intelligence community's findings that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. A day later, he attempted to correct one line from his remarks: \"I don't see any reason why it would be [Russia].\" But this bit of revisionism doesn't pass the smell test. Trump repeatedly cast doubt on the U.S. intelligence community's findings in Helsinki. At one point, he credited Putin's \"strong\" denials and said he had \"confidence in both parties.\" It wasn't just an issue of \"would\" or \"wouldn't.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/17/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
