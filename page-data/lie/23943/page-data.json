He never called one wrong. I don't know, 346. I don't know what the hell -- it's like, it's called 340. What's his number? What's his deal? Yeah. It's Silver, Silver, Nate Silver. They pay him a fortune. He said I think he gave us a 2% chance or 3%. Donald Trump is the 3% chance today of winning. The damn thing was over by 10 o'clock. He was given -- we were given a very tiny chance. What chance did he give us like 9%, something like that you know? They gave him millions of dollars shortly before 'cause he never called one wrong. He called that one wrong. He called that one wrong.”","analysis":"Actually, Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com kept warning people that Trump had a reasonable chance at winning. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/\">final 2016 forecast</a> at 538 gave Trump a 29 percent chance of winning the Electoral College. By comparison, other models <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html?_r=0#other-forecasts\">tracked by the New York Times</a> put Trump’s odds at: 15 percent, 8 percent, 2 percent and less than 1 percent. In addition, Trump seems to be confusing Nate Silver, of 538, with Nate Cohn, the Times pollster who modeled election outcomes in 2016.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
