We had a 3.2 [percent] GDP first quarter. It’s always 1 percent, less than 1 percent, it’s always the worst quarter -- we’re at 3.2, a point and a half above schedule. And you know why? Because so much money’s coming in from China. We've never took in any money from China.”","analysis":"Virtually every economist says that Trump's trade wars have helped slow economic growth, not enhance it. The money raised from tariffs is just a drop in the fiscal bucket. Meanwhile, tariffs have been collected on Chinese goods since the early days of the Republic. President George Washington signed the Tariff Act of 1789, when trade between China and the United States was already established. Tariffs on China have generated at least $8 billion every year since 2009. But it’s not China that pays the tariffs; it’s American importers who generally pass on the costs to Americans in the form of higher prices.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"30015, 30040, 29346, 29752, 28746, 28979, 26730, 25520, 25202, 24806, 24677, 24734, 24621, 24378, 23845, 23645, 23398, 23477, 23247, 21980, 22050, 22943, 22977, 22897, 22781, 21480, 21398, 22585, 21063, 20429, 20104, 19924, 19973, 19913, 19190, 18776, 19297, 18723, 18712, 18640, 19464, 19066, 17939, 17459, 17388, 18268, 16254, 15450, 14885, 14457, 15631, 15602, 14976, 15509, 13557, 13348, 13361, 13701, 13137, 13298, 12622, 13269, 13082, 11538, 12231, 11992, 11454, 11478, 11484, 11117, 10918, 10841, 10705, 10407, 10856, 10352, 8803","repeated_count":"77","date":"06/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
