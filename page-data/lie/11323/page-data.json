Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!”","analysis":"All four of the Congresswomen in question are American citizens. Only Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was not born in the U.S. She came as a refugee and then later became a citizen.
