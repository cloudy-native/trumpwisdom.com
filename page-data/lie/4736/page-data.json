Special counsel Robert Mueller's team continues to investigate Russia's interference in the 2016 election and has not announced whether or not Russia cooperated with Trump's campaign. There's no evidence that the Kremlin-connected lawyer who met with Trump Jr. during the campaign, Natalia Veselnitskaya, has any ties to the Clintons.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/01/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
