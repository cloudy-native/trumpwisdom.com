They got caught in the act.”","analysis":"Trump was not illegally impeached. Oddly, in this instance, he is referring back to the Russia investigation. He was not impeached for that probe, but for his efforts to force Ukraine to launch an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
