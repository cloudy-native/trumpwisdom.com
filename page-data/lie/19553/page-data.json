They're losing anywhere from two dollars to three or four dollars a package every time they deliver. So, it's not fair. And it's not fair to the people that work at the Postal Service.”","analysis":"False. The USPS constantly says package delivery is a bright spot in its revenue picture, increasing every year. “As a percentage of operating revenue, Shipping and Packages generated approximately 32%, 30% and 28% for the years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively,” USPS said in a 2019 regulatory filing.  In 2017, Amazon noted that the Postal Regulatory Commission “has consistently found that Amazon’s contracts with the USPS are profitable.” (Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, separately owns The Washington Post as a personal investment via Nash Holdings, LLC.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
