But it’s incredibly misleading.\n\nTrump is citing a possible death figure that was a worst-case scenario <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/how-one-model-simulated-22-million-us-deaths-covid-19\">produced by Imperial College London</a>, which assumed that 81 percent of the population became infected ­— 268 million people — and that 0.9 percent of them would die. It did so by also assuming people took no actions against the coronavirus — nobody avoided crowded elevators, wore masks, washed their hands more often, or bought gloves or hand sanitizer — which the study acknowledged was unrealistic: “It is highly likely that there would be significant spontaneous change in population behavior even in the absence of government‐mandated interventions.”  Moreover, even the 1918 flu pandemic is believed to have infected no more than 28 percent of the population, making the 81 percent figure suspect. Trump routinely mentions this figure to suggest he saved that many people from death, even as the actual death toll rises far above many of his earlier predictions. On March 29, he even said that a “very good job” would be if the death toll was between 100,000 and 200,000 dead. That assessment appears no longer operative.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"31106, 30329, 30357, 29785, 30250, 30455, 29183, 29376, 29588, 29072, 28633, 28437, 28519, 28384, 28499, 28754, 28848, 28061, 28095, 28291, 27952, 28215, 26936, 27021, 26773, 26822, 26649, 26704, 26722, 27063, 27146, 27393, 26909, 27251, 27368, 27540, 26344, 26413, 26480, 26176, 26250, 26282, 26305, 26148, 25655, 25743, 25747, 25553, 25456, 25481, 25507, 25428, 25208, 26572, 26018, 25828, 25856, 25106, 25000, 25026, 24974, 24871, 24881, 24888, 24950, 24747, 24833, 24692, 24617, 24363, 24273, 24274, 24303, 24221, 24073, 23886, 23957, 23312, 23733, 23729, 23559, 23208, 23188, 22037, 21957, 22399, 21020, 21026, 21530, 21544, 22485, 22534, 22902, 21298, 22795, 21757, 21253, 21218, 22660, 20925, 20822, 21628, 21083, 21145, 20883, 20706, 20666, 20653, 20599, 20073, 20087, 20009, 20059, 19945, 19905, 20287, 20338, 18733, 19337, 18878, 18883, 19413, 18794, 19306, 18744, 19284, 18714, 19214, 19223, 19194, 19126, 19174","repeated_count":"132","date":"10/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
