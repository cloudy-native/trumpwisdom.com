And you'll add on, and you'll make it more and more beautiful with time, but you have the best site and you have a great facility already. And we did it in four months instead of 25 years. So that wasn't so bad.”","analysis":"The U.S. spent about $400,000 to upgrade a consular facility and to relabel it an embassy. But it also signed a contract more than $20 million on security upgrades for the facility, so the initial cost is 100 times more than Trump’s claim. Moreover, this is only a temporary facility; a major embassy generally costs between $500 million and $1 billion.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"09/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
