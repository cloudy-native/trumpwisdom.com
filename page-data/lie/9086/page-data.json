I had a nasty business transaction with Robert Mueller a number of years ago. I said why isn't that mentioned? He wanted the job as FBI director. … Lying James Comey is his best friend. And those are a few of the conflicts. Other than that, it’s wonderful.”","analysis":"Without offering any evidence, Trump has claimed Mueller resigned his membership at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia in 2011 because of the disagreement over fees and believes he still holds a grudge against him over the matter. Mueller, who was FBI director at the time of the alleged dispute, denied the incident and any potential hard feelings. “Mr. Mueller left the club in October 2011 without dispute,” a spokesman for Mueller said. The special counsel's final report quotes from Mueller's letter to the club saying he was leaving because he did not use it much. The report also quotes former Trump aide Stephen Bannon as saying that Mueller was not interviewed for the FBI director position; he met with Trump \"to offer a perspective on the institution of the FBI.\" Both Mueller and former FBI director Comey have denied they are \"best friends\" or even have a close personal relationship. They have described themselves as former colleagues in the Department of Justice with long overlapping careers at which they intersected at the highest levels.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25098, 22333, 19759, 17186, 12985, 13610, 13114, 11345, 12137, 11864, 11188, 10741, 9086, 11034","repeated_count":"14","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
