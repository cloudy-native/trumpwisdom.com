But the dataset has limitations, and Trump's use of it twists it way out of context in a way that does not support his claim. The dataset included convictions of people who committed or planned terrorists attacks abroad, not in the U.S. homeland. It included people who were extradited for prosecution in the United States. And it excluded people who committed domestic terrorism.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Terrorism","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
