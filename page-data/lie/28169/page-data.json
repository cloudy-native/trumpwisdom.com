I was criticized for the ban. I said, 'No, if a country hates us, and if their people hate us, and if they wanna do bad things to us, we're gonna have a ban.' Everybody criticized me, but I won and the United States [Crosstalk] -- And now we don't let them in -- If it's okay by the great people of Pennsylvania, we don't let them into our country. We want people that will love us and work with us, and be a great help to us. That's what we want, so we have a ban. It was very controversial when I put it in, but it's not so controversial. All you have to do is look what happened the other day in Paris and you'll see that it's not so controversial anymore. People are very happy that we have it and we keep a lot of very bad people out of our country. And nobody else would do that. Nobody else would do that, Chris, I guarantee you that. Nobody else would do it. They pledged to terminate all national security travel bans. They wanna end the ban, opening the floodgates to radical, Islamic terrorism.”","analysis":"Trump has offered no evidence to back up his claim but his statement is problematic in the wake of the deadly shooting rampage at a Navy flight school in Pensacola, Fla., by a Saudi military student, Ahmed Mohammed al-Shamrani, in December of 2019. Trump’s travel ban covers these countries: Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen. (Chad was originally on the list but was removed in 2018 after the White House said the country improved security measures; Iraq and Sudan had been on earlier versions but not the one that passed muster with the Supreme Court.) So that means Saudi Arabia would not be covered. The travel ban essentially halted the issuance of immigrant visas to the affected countries and restricted certain types of nonimmigrant visas, such as for tourism and business, though it varied from country to country.
