They're testing missiles. And what is that all about? You look at the ballistic missiles that they're going and testing, what kind of a deal is it where you're allowed to test missiles all over the place? ...So what kind of a deal is this where it wasn't even discussed?”","analysis":"Trump is wrong to say missile testing was not discussed as part of the nuclear negotiations. The agreement itself does not deal with non-nuclear issues like ballistic missiles, but United Nations Resolution 2231, which replaced the previous Security Council resolutions on Iran, does, though language \"calls on\" Iran to refrain from ballistic missile testing, rather than prohibit such tests.
