In an opinion column Feb. 4 for the Deseret News, Ballard wrote that “the State Department reports that around 10,000 children are smuggled into the U.S. annually and forced into the commercial sex trade.” Ballard did not respond to a request for his source. The State Department has no records that would validate this claim.\n\nThe Justice Department, however, said that in fiscal 2017, “the FBI identified nearly 450 victims of domestic minor sex trafficking and adult domestic and foreign national victims of sex and labor trafficking.” It’s unclear how many were from Central America, but clearly it’s less than “thousands.”\n\nThe State Department’s 2018 report on human trafficking also reports that grantees funded by DOJ between July 2016 and June 2017 reported 4,349 new clients for victims of child sex trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation. But the report said only 34 percent were foreign nationals and one quarter were victims of labor trafficking. So again, it falls well short of “thousands” and certainly 10,000 being smuggled in for the sex trade.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"21506, 21460, 21122, 19399, 19155, 18608, 16871, 18307, 15193, 11544, 12104, 12052, 11498, 10102, 9771, 9187, 8782, 8701, 8650, 8431, 8489, 7804, 8172, 8099, 8101, 8105, 8074, 7973, 7881, 7655, 7107, 6810, 7053, 7083, 6166, 3513, 3944, 3013, 2645, 2750, 2692, 8605, 0945, 0532, 0456, 0445, 0448","repeated_count":"47","date":"02/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
