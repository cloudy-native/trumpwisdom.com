It's ridiculous.”","analysis":"Biden has proposed a significant tax increase, with about three-quarters of the increase paid by the top one percent of households. The Tax Policy Center originally pegged the increase at $4 trillion over ten years but a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/updated-analysis-former-vice-president-bidens-tax-proposals\">a later estimate</a> reduced it to $2.1 trillion. But Trump is wrong to claim this would be the biggest tax increase in history. When comparing revenue bills over many decades, percentage of the gross domestic product is the correct measure, not nominal dollars.  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-former-vice-president-bidens-tax-proposals\">Calculations by the Treasury Department</a> show that tax increases in 1941 and 1942 were a larger share of the economy. Tax increases in 1951 and 1968 were also larger, but were designed to be temporary so are harder to compare to Biden's proposed tax hike. \"In the first year, Biden’s tax plan would increase federal revenue by 0.68 percent of GDP [gross domestic product], making it the tenth largest tax increase since the 1940s,\" according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/joe-biden-tax-increases-historical-context/\">an analysis</a> by the Tax Foundation. \"In the second year of Biden’s plan, when the temporary expansion of the Child Tax Credit expires, the plan would increase federal revenue by 1.52 percent of GDP, tying for the fourth largest tax increase as a share of GDP since the 1940s.\" The biggest tax increase, the Revenue Act of 1942, boosted revenues 5.04 percent of GDP.
