In fact, the deal allowed Iran to continue enriching uranium and, over time, reach the brink of a nuclear breakout.”","analysis":"The JCPOA prohibits Iran from building nuclear weapons indefinitely; other international agreements to which Iran has committed itself also prohibit the development of such weapons. However, critics of the JCPOA have voiced concerns that — despite these strictures — Iran could keep working toward nuclear weapons capability under the guise of pursuing peaceful goals, such as a nuclear energy program. Trump is alluding to the fact that some restrictions in the JCPOA on centrifuge capacity, uranium enrichment and international monitoring sunset over time.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/08/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
