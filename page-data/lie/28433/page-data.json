Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's husband, Marc Mallory, did not get to use his boat and did not ignore coronavirus rules. Witmer said her husband \"made a failed attempt at humor last week when checking in with the small business that helps with our boat and dock up north.\" There was no restriction on boating at the time and he did not receive special treatment. \"Knowing it wouldn't make a difference, he jokingly asked if being married to me might move him up in the queue,\" she said. \"Obviously, with the motorized boating prohibition in our early days of Covid-19, he thought it might get a laugh. It didn't. And to be honest, I wasn't laughing either when it was relayed to me, because I knew how it would be perceived.\" She added: \"He regrets it, I wish it wouldn't have happened and that's really all we have to say about it.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"30281, 30446, 29350, 29612, 29515, 29099, 28433, 28510, 28733, 28136, 27977, 27568, 27725, 27769, 26971, 27046, 26781, 26712, 27060, 26912, 27294, 27452, 26352, 26483, 26254, 26290","repeated_count":"26","date":"10/28/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
