The 35 percent figure was from a subset of patients, comparing those who received plasma with a high concentration of antibodies to those who received a low concentration.   The study that produced the figure had not yet been peer-reviewed and was not a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment to a placebo. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn later apologized for mischaracterizing the results, but Trump did not and kept touting the figure.
