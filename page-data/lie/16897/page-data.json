Since 2006, each NATO member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending. Defense expenditures for NATO countries other than the United States have been going up — in a consistent slope — since 2014. That’s when NATO decided to boost spending in response to Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region. NATO estimates that its European members and Canada will add $130 billion in cumulative defense spending through 2020, in 2015 dollars, as an increase over 2016 spending. NATO also estimates the cumulative figure will rise to $400 billion through 2024.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"31587, 29679, 27787, 25395, 24756, 24637, 23788, 23404, 23079, 22087, 22307, 21125, 20811, 20120, 18781, 17719, 17335, 16897, 16644, 16172, 16071, 15010, 14587, 14599, 14670, 15778, 15781, 15787, 15810, 14000, 13618, 13510, 11564, 11411, 11459, 11247, 12249, 10911, 10553, 10557, 10896, 10251, 8359, 8028, 7920, 7928, 7313, 7218, 7488, 7207, 7205, 6226, 6179, 6191, 6406, 6118, 5962, 6098, 6317, 6318, 5361, 5368, 4803, 4821, 4881, 4755, 4767, 4594, 4370, 4586, 4588, 4747, 4748, 4296, 3896, 3733, 3884, 3761, 4188, 4199, 3793, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3626, 3638, 3639, 3779, 4210, 4214, 4215, 3641, 3748, 3751, 3419, 3591, 3646, 3649, 3738, 3740, 3319, 4117, 4118, 4122, 4123, 3600, 3574, 3990, 3402, 3348, 2951, 2785, 2812, 2825, 2839, 2659, 1903, 1873, 1645, 0759, 0761, 0638, 0616, 0598, 0600, 0591, 0592, 0593, 0594, 0524, 0474, 0486, 0422, 0300, 0267, 0256, 0188","repeated_count":"137","date":"02/04/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
