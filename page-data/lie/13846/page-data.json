Here are Omar remarks: “Here’s the truth. For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties. So you can't just say that today someone is looking at me strange and that I am trying to make myself look pleasant. You have to say that this person is looking at me strange, I am not comfortable with it, and I am going to talk to them and ask them why. Because that is the right you have.” She was using “some people” to refer to the terrorists, just as former president George W. Bush did immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks and at no point did she suggest that the attacks were not a \"big deal.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
