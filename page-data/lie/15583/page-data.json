You don't fire the guy, you get nothing.’ And it's on tape, and the press refuses to print it. You talk quid pro quo. ‘You fire that guy, you got to -- you don't fire, you get nothing.’ Think of that one, okay? That's called quid pro quo, not here. That was said by Joe Biden to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine, who is looking at his son, who just got thrown out of the Navy, who was paid millions and millions of dollars, even though he had absolutely no energy experience.”","analysis":"Trump perhaps could be excused for getting this wrong, since former vice president Joe Biden gave a speech in 2018 that flubbed the timeline of his campaign to oust Ukraine's top prosecutor. As we <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/02/correcting-media-error-bidens-ukraine-showdown-was-december/\">reported</a>, Biden traveled to Ukraine in late 2015 and was not physically present in the country for the final push, months later, when Ukraine removed the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"31315, 28202, 26979, 27285, 27496, 26335, 26239, 26262, 26077, 25719, 25559, 25341, 25149, 26546, 26015, 25973, 25845, 24776, 24594, 24392, 23407, 22368, 20964, 22135, 21338, 21171, 20483, 17613, 16804, 16450, 15985, 14846, 14550, 15583, 14996, 15487, 15497, 15499, 14189, 14624, 13908, 13601, 13065, 13461, 13031, 13229, 13185, 13198, 13372, 13378, 12828, 12851, 12874, 12928, 12815, 13345, 13097, 10693, 10694","repeated_count":"59","date":"11/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
