They're being used by the coyotes. They're being sold left and right. People are grabbing them to get in because our laws are really lousy. And if you have a child with you, it's easier to get in. These people know it better than anybody -- far better than the people in Washington. And I think the biggest victims are children and women”","analysis":"Coyotes and smugglers do operate along the border. But Trump's claim that children are being sold \"left and right\" is greatly exaggerated. It is well established that thousands of Central American families are trying to immigrate and that thousands of unaccompanied children are also apprehended at the southern border each month. Border officials screen for false claims of parentage.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
