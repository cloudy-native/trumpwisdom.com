But his five-year ban on lobbying is less than advertised. Trump has originally promised to extend the ban to congressional officials, but he did not. Moreover, the five-year ban applies only to lobbying one’s former agency — not becoming a lobbyist. Moreover, Trump actually weakened some of the language from similar bans under Obama and George W. Bush, and reduced the level of transparency.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
