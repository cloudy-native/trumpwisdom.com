Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!”","analysis":"Sessions is recused and can't take any action regarding the Russia investigation. There's no evidence that the special counsel investigation is a witch hunt or a hoax. In fact, the special counsel has revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The investigation into potential collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign and obstruction of justice continues, and no conclusions have been announced. Eleven out of 16 attorneys on Mueller's team made public so far have contributed to Democrats, including Clinton and Obama. The other five have no record of political contributions, though the Daily Caller says 13 are registered Democrats. One attorney who donated the maximum amount represented the Clinton Foundation in a 2015 lawsuit. Another attorney without a record of political donations represented a Clinton aide at one point. Both attorneys worked for WilmerHale, a firm that also represents Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, as well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Moreover, under federal law, Mueller is not allowed to consider the political leanings of his staff when hiring them.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"29797, 30459, 28072, 25594, 24537, 23434, 20513, 17112, 17187, 16091, 16463, 16006, 15481, 14358, 14415, 13759, 13842, 13611, 12957, 13677, 12149, 12039, 12029, 11944, 11863, 11169, 11189, 11774, 11116, 11095, 10915, 10746, 10728, 10717, 10437, 10958, 10960, 10537, 10541, 10542, 10932, 10129, 10283, 9953, 10146, 10149, 10114, 9764, 10021, 10073, 9917, 9824, 9738, 9740, 9346, 9085, 8702, 8050, 7582, 7583, 7584, 7269, 7266, 6580, 6535, 7516, 7211, 7213, 6999, 7452, 5056, 5057, 5040, 5969, 4818, 4756, 4497, 4357, 4406, 4479, 4383, 4469, 4274, 4532, 3611, 3628, 3647, 3388, 3421, 3920, 3930, 3289, 3291, 3241, 3242, 3180, 3248, 3062, 3041, 2944, 2614, 0723","repeated_count":"102","date":"08/01/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
