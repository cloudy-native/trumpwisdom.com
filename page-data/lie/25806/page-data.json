Trump points to a comment by former vice president Joe Biden — “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia … and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science” — but Biden says that did not refer to the travel restrictions. He made no mention of the travel restrictions at the time he made the comment. He later said he supported the restrictions. In any case, the virus was already spreading through the United States, and there is little evidence the travel restrictions on China saved lives, especially because the Trump administration did not rapidly set up an effective testing regimen, as did many other countries. Biden did not apologize.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
