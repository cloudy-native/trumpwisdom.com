Remember the word? Remember? We started five years ago, and I said, 'You're gonna be saying Christmas again.' We say it proudly again. Although they'll, they'll be trying to take that word again out of the vocabulary. We're not gonna let 'em do that....they even want to take away your beautiful Christmas that we just got back.”","analysis":"This claim is a strange favorite of the president's. There is no evidence that stores stopped using Merry Christmas in their advertising, were \"ashamed\" to do so or that any of this changed since Trump took office.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30893, 29550, 28895, 28121, 27796, 27862, 27164, 16615, 16418, 16244","repeated_count":"10","date":"12/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
