Nearly 100 percent of the heroin in our country comes across the southern border, killing 300 Americans, at least, a week. A week. According to the Council of Economic Advisers, this illegal heroin cost our country $238 billion dollars in 2016 alone. Think of that. And we're talking about a wall for $20 billion, $15 billion.”","analysis":"Trump claims a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico will help stop illegal drugs from being trafficked into the country. But a wall will have virtually no effect on drug trafficking. That's because the majority of drugs are driven across the border through legal points of entry, or smuggled in underground tunnels. It's also misleading to compare the estimates on the cost of heroin and the wall, as the former cannot be repurposed to pay for the latter.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31475, 21854, 21391, 21437, 19398, 19152, 18027, 16849, 12684, 11032, 10489, 10262, 10098, 9897, 9778, 9811, 9611, 9240, 8971, 8983, 8937, 8820, 8845, 8794, 8747, 8448, 8531, 8482, 8491, 8506, 8386, 8023, 7789, 7795, 8234, 8242, 8248, 8039, 8093, 7769, 8071, 7755, 7975, 7954, 7858, 7712, 7697, 7702, 7681, 7684, 7653, 7656, 7480, 7575, 7264, 7119, 7156, 6811, 6906, 6601, 6766, 7082, 5472, 4581, 3451, 3490, 3845, 3175, 2834, 2748, 2641, 2630, 2922, 2598, 2652, 2411, 2335, 2099, 2121, 2056, 2066, 2052, 2094, 2103, 1998, 2000, 2004, 1994, 1952, 1775, 1572, 1407, 1414, 1458, 1449, 1478, 1395, 1194, 1138, 1137, 1034, 1136","repeated_count":"102","date":"12/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
