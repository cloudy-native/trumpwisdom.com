Remember he shot and killed a young man in the middle of the street, just shot him like uh oh, I don't even say like what, because his parents are so devastated. A young man and they shot him and killed him. This one guy. This one animal. And two and a half -- That's right over his hat, not our hat, it was another hat. It was a Christian hat. He was a Christian and he was a Christian. He was a Christian and they shot him, killed him instantly and this guy that shot him everybody knew who he was, right? And I said after two days, 'Where is he? Did you arrest him?' 'No, we didn't.' After two and a half days, 'Did you arrest him?' And then I put out on social media, 'Why didn't you arrest him?' And you know what? The U.S. marshall saw it and they went in and he pulled a gun on them and 15 minutes it was all over. None of our guys were hurt and he was good. This guy was a stone-cold killer and yet they say he was a protester, he's not a protester, an anarchist and a killer. And the U.S. Marshals, thank you. That was an incredible job they did, great.”","analysis":"A New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/us/michael-reinoehl-antifa-portland-shooting.html\">investigation</a> painted a different picture of what happened when the Marshals approached Michael Reinoehl who was suspected of fatally shooting a far-right protester. The Times wrote, “In interviews with 22 people who were near the scene, all but one said they did not hear officers identify themselves or give any commands before opening fire. In their official statements, not yet made public, the officers offered differing accounts of whether they saw Mr. Reinoehl with a weapon. One told investigators he thought he saw Mr. Reinoehl raise a gun inside the vehicle before the firing began, but two others said they did not.” Moreover, the task force that was involved included a mix of U.S. Marshals with state and local law enforcement.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
