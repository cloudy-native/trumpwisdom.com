That was a bad day.”","analysis":"African-Americans represent 12.3 percent of manufacturing workers overall, but they comprise 16.7 percent of motor vehicle and motor vehicle equipment manufacturers and 17.4 percent of tire manufacturers. Millions of manufacturing jobs and thousands of U.S. manufacturing establishments have disappeared since NAFTA took effect in 1994 and China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001, but it's difficult to isolate how much of that was because of the trade agreements and not other factors such as automation. The studies we reviewed indicate NAFTA had a modest effect on the U.S. economy. Auto industry representatives and independent analysts seem to agree the NAFTA dynamics have helped rather than hindered automakers with U.S. operations.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
