He's done a terrible job. 11,000 people died in the nursing home....He put them back in – infected people back in with our elderly population, knowing that our elderly population is susceptible, Andrew Cuomo. He killed thousands and thousands of people.”","analysis":"At the time of this statement, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/longtermcare\">according to the COVID Tracking Project</a>, 6,624 people have died of covid-19 in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities in New York, accounting for 26 percent of the state’s 25,275 covid-19 deaths. So Trump's number is inflated. More broadly, while the issue is sharply debated, it unclear the extent to which the governor’s policy -- directing nursing homes in the state to accept patients who had or were suspected of having covid-19 -- was responsible for nursing home COVID-19 deaths.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28301, 26708, 27403, 26234, 24985, 23341, 23285, 23300, 23123, 21534","repeated_count":"10","date":"10/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
