Democrats in Congress have opposed every measure that would close these immigration loopholes and bring the slaughter to an end.”","analysis":"There is limited research on the impact of sanctuary policies and crime. And the research that does exist challenges Trump’s claim. There’s no official definition of “sanctuary,” but it generally refers to rules restricting state and local governments from alerting federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. A handful of studies looked at whether there is a causation between sanctuary cities and crime. They either found no statistically significant impact of sanctuary policies on crime, or a reduction in crime due to immigrant-friendly policing strategies. It's not exactly something Democrats can \"vote for.\"","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"30309, 30538, 29551, 29970, 28701, 27674, 28076, 28167, 28336, 26836, 26588, 25915, 23512, 22013, 20940, 21595, 22515, 21417, 21459, 21101, 20636, 18728, 17868, 17816, 17583, 18408, 18368, 18301, 18201, 16545, 16199, 16479, 16344, 15439, 14953, 15373, 15607, 15471, 15176, 15182, 15194, 15199, 15107, 13857, 13721, 11632, 10191, 9922, 9784, 9266, 8755, 7574, 7358, 6933, 6603, 6633, 6372, 6492, 5896, 5412, 5592, 5511, 5514, 5218, 4419, 4580, 4400, 3461, 3382, 2780, 2783, 2827, 2835, 2633, 2620, 2621, 2700, 2654, 2180, 1204, 0450, 0092, 0053","repeated_count":"83","date":"06/16/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
