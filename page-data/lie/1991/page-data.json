Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record!”","analysis":"This is an odd one. Trump apparently saw a news report saying that there were no aviation deaths worldwide in 2017, but the U.S. skies have been extraordinarily safe for years. Government data shows the last fatal commercial plane crash in the United States took place in early 2009, shortly after Barack Obama became president, so he could have laid claim to seven straight years of safe flying. But, even before then, the last major U.S. airline fatal crash took place in 2001, in the Bush administration. A U.S. president actually has very little to do with ensuring the safety of commercial aviation, although certainly his choice of regulators is important. The decline in air crashes over the past decade to nil is mostly the result of better training and oversight of pilots and air traffic controllers and improvements made by jet and engine manufacturers.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
