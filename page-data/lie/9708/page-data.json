In 1990, Schumer put forth a bill that proposed making a set number of visas available each year to “diversity immigrants” from “low-admission” countries. Despite being couched as a “diversity” action, it was openly pitched as a way to aid the Irish. Schumer’s bill was absorbed into broader immigration legislation, which, when it passed the House, Schumer said he was “proud to put together a major portion of the bill that is going to say to Irish, to Poles, to Nigerians: You're not going to be excluded anymore.” The bill passed with bipartisan support in the House and Senate and was signed into law by then President George H.W. Bush on Nov. 29, 1990. But in 2013, Schumer was part of the \"Gang of Eight\" that pushed an overall of immigration laws that would have eliminated the Diversity Lottery program. That measure passed the Senate but was blocked by conservatives in the House.\n\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
