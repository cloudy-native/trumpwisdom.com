I should have said. You know, five or six years ago, they all wanted the wall. It was only when I came along and I said we've got to build the wall now. … I figured that they'd all join but said they said, no, we don't want the wall anymore.”","analysis":"Sen. Charles Schumer and many Democrats (though not Rep. Nancy Pelosi) voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was signed by President George W. Bush and authorized building a fence along nearly 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. It passed 283-138 in the House, with 64 Democrat votes, and 80-19 in the Senate, with 26 Democrat votes. But the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself has called the 2006 fence a “nothing wall.” \n\nTo Trump, opposing the wall is tantamount to not wanting any border security at all. But Democrats have offered support for $1.67 billion in security enhancements. That doesn't include funding for Trump’s wall, but it includes 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the Southeast Texas border with Mexico, similar to what already exists.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31482, 24398, 20407, 16846, 16087, 14949, 15579, 14266, 14609, 13946, 13862, 13709, 12022, 11920, 11784, 9587, 9239, 8643, 8479, 8483, 8282, 7811, 8013, 8095, 8104, 7771, 8090, 8221, 7863, 7699, 7685, 7594, 7431, 7536, 7446","repeated_count":"35","date":"11/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
