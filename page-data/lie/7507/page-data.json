It has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays. Much talk over dividing up the 9th Circuit into 2 or 3 Circuits. Too big!”","analysis":"The reversal rate is largely meaningless because the Supreme Court rarely takes cases to affirm the rulings from lower courts. In any case, the 9th Circuit is not the most overturned court by the annual reversal rate. It does have a high raw number of reversals or number of cases on the Supreme Court docket. But it also reviews more cases than other circuits, is larger than other circuits and terminates far more cases than other circuits.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/21/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
