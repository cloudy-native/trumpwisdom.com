Remember I said I have more Indian blood in me than you have and I have none, and I'd love to have some, but I don't happen to have any. And then she choked and she went out and got a test and she announced yet 1,024, right, 1,024. That means like, I said it last night, that means around 700 or 800 years ago, somewhere, there was a little bit of a relationship going and that's OK, 700 or 800 years ago maybe.”","analysis":"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released the results of her DNA test, which showed that she likely had a sixth generation ancestor with Native American heritage in the mid-1800s. Early news reports had incorrectly suggested a range of 1/64th to 1/1024th, which some misreported as less than the average European-American. Trump has seized on the misleading news reports to incorrectly say she has no Native American heritage. She has some but her DNA is more than 95 percent European-American.
