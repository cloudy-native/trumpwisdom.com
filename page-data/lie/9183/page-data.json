At the time of this statement, there had been about 436,000 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES3000000001\">manufacturing jobs</a> created in his term. There has been steady growth in jobs since the Great Recession, though manufacturing job growth had stalled in the year before Trump's election. Despite Trump's prediction of a big gain in the next jobs report, only 4,000 manufacturing jobs were created in the month of February when the report was issued two days after this statement.
