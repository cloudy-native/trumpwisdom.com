And I told my guys at NASA, you know NASA when we took it over, it was exhausted. The runways and the grounds that are all weeds growing through the cracks in the concrete. You wouldn't recognize it now, it's beautiful, it's the best place anywhere on Earth.”","analysis":"Trump claims credit for reinvigorating NASA, but things have hardly changed since he became president. The space agency already had plans to go to Mars as early as the 2030s. Those plans and the schedule are unchanged. Trump requested an extra $1.6 billion for NASA to return to the moon by 2024, but he claims credit for much more than that. For perspective, the total budget for 2020, with Trump's proposed $1.6 billion addition, would be $22.6 billion. It's false to claim the agency was \"exhausted\" or that runways were dilapidated.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
