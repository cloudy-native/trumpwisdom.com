The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth.”","analysis":"Trump is mischaracterizing the bill that was being considered and the Democrats' position on late term abortion. The bill required health care providers to “exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child” as he or she would to “any other child born alive at the same gestational age.” Opponents argued that it would prevent doctors from exercising medical judgment based on the situation and open them up to possible prosecution or litigation for following their medical opinion. Plus, they argued, infanticide, which the bill is supposedly preventing, is already illegal. Democrats do not support “executing” newborns.
