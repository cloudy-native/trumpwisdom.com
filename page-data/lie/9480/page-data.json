Rasmussen consistently has a Republican-leaning bias, so the polling gurus at FiveThirtyEight say that an adjusted rating would have shown Trump at 44 percent approval in the poll. On the day of the tweet, Trump had an average approval of 41.9 percent in 538's blended poll rating, along with 52.8 percent disapproval.
