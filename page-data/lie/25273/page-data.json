But there are some reasons to doubt the sincerity of this pledge. In an interview with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/22/davos-2020-cnbcs-full-interview-with-president-trump.html\">CNBC in January 2020</a>, Trump had said \"At the right time, we will take a look at that,\" referring to possible reductions in spending on safety net programs, adding that \"we're going to look\" at cutting Medicare.
