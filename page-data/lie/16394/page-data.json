The Witch Hunt is sputtering badly, but still going on (Ukraine Hoax!). If this... ....had happened to a Presidential candidate, or President, who was a Democrat, everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more), and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY, far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!”","analysis":"The Justice Department inspector general's report does not state that the FBI spied on Trump's campaign. A secret surveillance warrant was obtained on Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page, who had left the campaign by the time the FISA application was approved. The warrant was renewed three times. The inspector general found numerous errors in the warrant application but no bias in the FBI's decision-making. Trump often tries to connect the Russia investigation by his own Justice Department with the Ukraine scandal and impeachment probe in Congress, suggesting a grand conspiracy working against him. But the connection is non-existent, making Trump's claim grossly deceptive. Senior Trump administration officials, including the president’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, raised concerns about the administration’s dealings with Ukraine. The House intelligence committee gathered evidence that Trump withheld $391 million in security assistance funds for Ukraine while he pressed that country to publicly announce investigations into Joe Biden and into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukrainians and not Russians interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Both investigations stood to benefit Trump politically. The testimony of senior officials was corroborated by text messages, emails, documents, Trump’s own public remarks and a rough transcript of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Whether the evidence is enough to remove Trump from office is a question for the Senate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
