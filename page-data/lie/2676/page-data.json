Not acceptable!”","analysis":"Trump repeated an out-of-date talking point. Not only is the United States not being hurt by China’s current currency manipulation, China is also not devaluing its currency anymore. In fact, China is selling foreign currency to prop up its own, in an effort to prevent the yuan from depreciating further and destabilizing the Chinese and global economy. Moreover, Trump's Twitter comment directly contradicted a report issued just days before by the Treasury Department. The report did not accuse either country of artificially lowering the value of its currency, Instead, it found that China’s currency had recently moved in a direction that should benefit U.S. exporters.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"0341, 0041","repeated_count":"2","date":"04/16/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
