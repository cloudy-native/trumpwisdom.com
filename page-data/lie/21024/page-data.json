A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-1315_article\">large study conducted in South Korea</a> using contact tracing found that children ages 10 to 19 can spread the virus at least as much as adults do; children younger than 10 were half as likely to transmit the virus, but there was still a risk. And <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/israelis-fear-schools-reopened-too-soon-as-covid-19-cases-climb-11594760001\">in Israel</a>, at least 1,335 students and 691 staff members contracted the coronavirus after Israel reopened its entire school system without restrictions on May 17, believing it had beaten the virus.
