Trump acts as if the money has been spent, but he is referring to a study that included estimates of future obligations through 2056 for veterans' care. The study combines data for both George W. Bush's war in Iraq (2003) and the war in Afghanistan (2001), which is in Central/South Asia, not the Middle East, as well as homeland security spending. The cost of the combined wars will probably surpass $7 trillion by 2056, when interest on the debt is considered, almost four decades from now.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"24770, 24691, 24735, 24284, 20532, 20095, 20013, 18774, 18731, 19280, 19527, 19062, 18603, 19046, 17756, 17246, 14945, 15604, 14698, 14397, 14354, 14639, 13982, 14232, 13949, 15113, 13876, 12766, 13587, 12794, 13322, 11368, 12119, 11249, 11841, 10317, 10320, 9363, 9121, 8639, 8462, 7717, 5067, 3586, 3539, 3185, 3217, 2995, 2909, 2820, 2867, 2557, 2277, 2421, 2198, 2316, 2324, 2084, 1947, 1920, 1935, 1964, 1878, 1681, 1020, 1037, 0853, 0678, 0709, 0637, 0635, 0364, 0314, 0185, 0158, 0146, 0058, 0028","repeated_count":"78","date":"06/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
