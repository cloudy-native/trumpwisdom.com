HOPE YOU SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. VOTE NOW!”","analysis":"The president wrote this tweet over a video posted by the head of a conservative group, Young Americans for Liberty. “If you would have told me in 2019 that we were just 1 year away from Americans being ARRESTED for holding outdoor church services, I would have thought you to be insane,\" Cliff Maloney wrote on Sept. 24. “This is one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever seen. Pray for America.” The 11-second video shows police arresting a man as churchgoers sing a hymn. But the tweet is placing the event out of context. So what is happening in this video? It was a protest, not a church service. The Fact Checker video team <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/07/trump-tweets-video-mask-protest-claiming-it-is-church-service/\">called it</a> an example of “misrepresentation” — presenting unaltered video in an inaccurate manner misrepresents the footage and misleads the viewer. This is an especially egregious version, given that the singing might suggest to viewers it was indeed a church service, not a protest. Trump’s false commentary that Democrats want to permanently close churches only adds to the Pinocchio scale.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/07/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
