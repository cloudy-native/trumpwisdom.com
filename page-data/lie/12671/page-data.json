It reached a low of 5.9 percent in May 2018, but rose to 6.0 percent {in July}. An older set of government data suggests black unemployment went much lower in the 1950s. The Asian-American statistic has been around for less than 20 years. And while it reached a low of 2.0 percent rate in May 2018, it rose to 2.9 percent {in August}, the most recent month available.
