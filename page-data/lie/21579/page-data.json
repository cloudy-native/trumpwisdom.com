Turkey can definitely take care of itself. I have a very good relationship with President Erdoğan. And Syria has been fighting forever...They've been fighting like they have been for a thousand years.”","analysis":"Trump frequently and misleadingly says there has been a conflict lasting \"hundreds of years\" or \"centuries\" between the Turks and the Kurds, apparently as explanation for why a U.S. role in the region would be fruitless. This is not only simplistic but historically ignorant and false. There has been a hundred-year effort to create a Kurdish state in the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, with the Kurds frequently manipulated by great powers seeking to flex their muscles against a particular nation. The  Kurdish people are not natural enemies of the Turks and their history has periods of peace and suppression between violence.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"24488, 21579, 19321, 16511, 16648, 16806, 14482, 14489, 15464, 15518, 14695, 14704, 14362, 14343, 14101, 15135, 13970, 13971, 14005, 15119, 13913, 15038, 13805, 13809, 13865","repeated_count":"25","date":"08/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
