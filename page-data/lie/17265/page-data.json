Net worth for the bottom half has gone up, but it was from such a low base that it’s pretty silly to call it a boom. People in the bottom half have essentially no wealth — just 1.6 percent of the nation’s wealth — as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have. The top 5 percent hold more than 70 percent of all net worth in the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"17500, 17265, 16887, 16833","repeated_count":"4","date":"02/07/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
