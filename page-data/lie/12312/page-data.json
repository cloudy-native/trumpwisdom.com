She forgot: In three weeks, she was going to West Virginia. Remember, she wanted to close up all coal. She was in an area where they didn't do the coal. And she said, 'Well, I look forward to closing up all coal. It's going to be closed. Steel -- going to be in big trouble.'”","analysis":"Trump mischaracterizes what Clinton said and where she said it. Her comment was made in a town hall in Ohio, which is a coal state. She had put together a $30 billion package to aid coal communities as reliance on coal was phased out (a trend that has continued under Trump), and her point was the United States needs to be prepared to help people transition to a different economy.  \"Instead of dividing people the way Donald Trump does, let’s reunite around politics that will bring jobs and opportunities to all these underserved poor communities. So, for example, I'm the only candidate who has a policy about how to bring economic opportunity using clean renewable energy as the key into coal country. Because we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business, right, Tim?,\" she said, referring to Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH), who was in the audience. \"And we're going to make it clear that we don't want to forget those people. Those people labored in those mines for generations, losing their health, often losing their lives to turn on our lights and power our factories. Now we've got to move away from coal and all the other fossil fuels, but I don't want to move away from the people who did the best they could to produce energy that we relied on.\" As for steel, Clinton said during the campaign: \"Steel is crucial to our manufacturing base, crucial to our national security, and I will not let this vital industry disappear.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/13/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
