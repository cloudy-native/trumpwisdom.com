The supply chain is crumbling because they can't pay the tariffs, and our country has taken over things that you would have never thought.”","analysis":"Trump claims “thousands of companies” have been leaving China since his tariffs took effect, but neither his administration nor his campaign has offered proof. The Trump campaign spokesman pointed to a July 14 article in the Wall Street Journal, which said the U.S. manufacturers behind “Crocs shoes, Yeti beer coolers, Roomba vacuums and GoPro cameras are producing goods in other countries to avoid U.S. tariffs of as much as 25% on some $250 billion of imports from China,” among others.\nBut China has more than half a million foreign-invested firms, according to the Peterson Institute. Multinational companies with Chinese operations in some cases say they're leaving, or planning to leave, because of rising labor costs or lower costs in neighboring countries such as Vietnam. Those dynamics predated Trump’s tariffs.  A survey published in August by the U.S.-China Business Council showed that 87 percent of members had no plans to leave China, while 95 percent said they were in the country to serve the Chinese market.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
