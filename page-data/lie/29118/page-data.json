Let's hire Donna Brazile, who got fired by CNN, and gets hired by Fox.”","analysis":"Trump overstates the disclosure about Clinton getting a debate question. During the Democratic primaries, a debate was held in Flint, Mich., to focus on the water crisis. Donna Brazile, then an analyst with CNN, sent an email to the Clinton campaign saying that a woman with a rash from lead poisoning was going to ask what Clinton as president could do the help the people of Flint. There’s no indication Clinton was told this information, but in any case it’s a pretty obvious question for a debate being held in Flint. The woman in question also was not happy with Clinton’s answer.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"29118, 25385, 18937, 13803, 2933, 0790, 0343, 0307, 0097","repeated_count":"9","date":"10/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
