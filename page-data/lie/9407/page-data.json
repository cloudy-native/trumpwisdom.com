The CNN poll on whether economic conditions are good does not go back to 1995, but an equivalent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1609/consumer-views-economy.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> (in which 53 percent rated the economy as excellent or good) in 1995 found that just 29 percent rated the economy that highly. So Clinton had an even higher approval rating under more difficult economic conditions.
