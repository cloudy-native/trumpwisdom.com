The Electoral College is so much better suited to the Democrats.”","analysis":"Trump is falsely labeling nonpartisan investigations as made up by Democrats. The CIA concluded in 2016 that Russia intervened in the U.S. presidential election to help elect Trump, an assessment backed up by FBI Director James B. Comey and then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. On Jan. 6, the intelligence community released a declassified report expressing \"high confidence\" in this judgement. Senate and House committees led by Republicans have begun their own investigations, and a special prosecutor has been appointed. Democrats obviously do not have an Electoral College lock. According to a tally by John Pitney of Claremont McKenna College, every Republican president since Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 won a larger share of the electoral college votes than Trump, with the exception of George W. Bush (twice) and Nixon in 1968.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"13758, 4992, 3612, 3396, 2911, 2080, 1928, 1416, 1418, 1446, 1397, 1351, 1200, 1030, 0860, 0672, 0572, 0561, 0467, 0284, 0157","repeated_count":"21","date":"12/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
