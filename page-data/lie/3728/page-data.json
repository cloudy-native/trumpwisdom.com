Who would even think we have so many? Is it possible? So, I used to think it was a mistake. And then I very -- sheepishly, I said it, 60,000. I went through a speech. I didn't get corrected. Then again, 60,000. Then, after four or five times, I realized that they agree that we lost 60,000. We lost 60,000 factories. Do you know how many jobs that is? Nobody even knows how many jobs. And we lost them because of stupidity. Stupidity. We lost them to other countries. We lost our businesses and our jobs to other countries.”","analysis":"Trump is likely referring to the number of U.S. factory closures and job losses since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, a talking point he often uses. These remarks were made during a discussion of new China tariffs. The number for factory closures is accurate, but to suggest China was the only factor is misleading. Economists say automation and other forces also played a role. The number for job losses is seriously exaggerated. Official government data show 4.3 million to 4.7 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost after China joined the WTO -- but, again, although China had a big role, it's misleading to blame it all on them.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
