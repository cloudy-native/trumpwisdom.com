Halfway housing is not “free housing.” As the BOP website says: “During their stay, offenders are required to pay a subsistence fee to help defray the cost of their confinement; this charge is 25 percent of their gross income, not to exceed the per diem rate for that contract. The contractor assists inmates in locating suitable housing (if necessary), to which they can release from the RRC.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"22207, 21512, 21464, 21115","repeated_count":"4","date":"07/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
