Mexico, $71 billion a year, right? We have a trade deficit with Canada of a substantial amount of money.”","analysis":"Trump, as is his practice, inflates the size of the trade deficit by only counting goods, not goods and services. The 2016 trade deficit with Mexico was $56 billion. Meanwhile, Trump frequently suggests the United States is “losing money” when there is a trade deficit, but that reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price.  If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Mexican goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce the purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would “gain” money that had been lost.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"11711, 10905, 10805, 10795, 10882, 9599, 9602, 9542, 8594, 7997, 7739, 5270, 4799, 4982, 5009, 3888, 3603, 3836, 3443, 3570, 3987, 3415, 3486, 3530, 3908, 3261, 3074, 2705, 2818, 2804, 2584, 2448, 2390, 2200, 2333, 2101, 2072, 1958, 1852, 1589, 2095, 1535, 2102, 1504, 2136, 0543, 0463, 2137","repeated_count":"48","date":"01/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
