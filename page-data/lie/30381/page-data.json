He appears to have focused on the fact that he got 8 percent of the Black vote vs. 6 percent for Mitt Romney in 2012 and 4 percent for John McCain in 2008. In the polling world, a two- or even four-percentage-point shift is relatively small. Moreover, who was running as a Democrat in 2008 and 2012? The first African American candidate, Barack Obama. Trump was not running against a Black man, so that further discounts his claims of a substantial achievement. Strictly by the numbers, Trump actually did worse than any Republican running against a White man, though in effect he came close to tying George W. Bush in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1984. But in the 2020 election, Trump made some gains with Black voters, in particular men. Preliminary exit polls show Biden won Black voters overall by 87 percent to 12 percent nationwide, a 75-point margin that is slightly smaller than Clinton’s 81-point margin in 2016 and Barack Obama’s 87-point advantage in 2012. Trump won 19 percent support among Black men, up from 13 percent four years ago and the most for a Republican candidate in exit polls since 1980.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"30337, 30381, 29835, 29436, 29636, 25369, 25212, 24811, 24385, 24231, 20718, 17193, 15307, 15324, 14258, 14081, 13154, 10055, 7166, 2938, 0170, 0043","repeated_count":"22","date":"11/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
