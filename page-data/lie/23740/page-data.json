Bush. President Barack Obama later expanded this stimulus. The economic recovery under Obama was the slowest since World War II, but it doesn't come close to being as slow as the 10-year lull caused by the Great Depression. Moreover, Trump falsely claims \"we were headed down\" when in fact he inherited an economy that already had the longest period of unbroken job growth in U.S. history. All of the economic trends that are promising under Trump's administration began under Obama's.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"23740, 23380, 23524, 5926, 5495, 5071, 4781, 4858, 5007, 2327, 2197, 2069","repeated_count":"12","date":"09/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
