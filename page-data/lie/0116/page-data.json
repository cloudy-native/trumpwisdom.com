Can you believe this? I said no way. I said I refuse to fly in a $4.2 billion airplane. I refuse.”","analysis":"Trump is exaggerating here. Boeing only had a $170 million contract to begin designing a replacement for Air Force One, and the cost of the project had not been set. The Defense Department’s five-year plan indicated a cost of $2.9 billion over the next five years for design and development. It’s logical to assume at least another $1 billion in additional expenses to complete and procure the aircraft. An estimate of $4 billion — for design, testing and manufacture of at least two jets — was not completely out of line. But the budget was subject to approval by Congress and the actual design of the aircraft. So Trump is taking credit for cutting a price that had not been negotiated yet.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"27939, 24650, 24559, 20032, 11820, 0135, 0116","repeated_count":"7","date":"02/18/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
