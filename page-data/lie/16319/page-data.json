Going back 20 years, it was about 6 percent. Adjusted for inflation, the purchasing power of paychecks has barely budged over the last 40 years, though the Congressional Budget Office found that wages grew for all income groups during this period. The rate of increase, however, was most dramatic for the top 1 percent, while everyone else saw relatively modest increases.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
