We were going to have no steel industry within a couple of years.”","analysis":"This is mostly false. Steel plants are not \"roaring back to life\" after Trump imposed steel and aluminum tariffs. In fact, trade and economic experts say the tariffs could cost U.S. jobs. Although some investments have been announced, the steel industry was not going out of business, as Trump suggests. Big integrated steel mills had trouble competing with more nimble and efficient mini-mills.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29780, 29347, 29493, 29749, 29123, 28074, 28325, 26632, 24774, 23474, 20989, 19323, 17936, 17109, 17286, 18151, 16197, 15437, 15830, 14939, 14020, 13773, 12291, 11631, 12041, 12199, 11458, 11800, 11026, 10579, 10941, 10314, 10288, 9977, 9990, 9755, 9666, 9392, 8872, 8847, 8572, 8508, 8068, 7969, 7977, 7397, 7421, 7017, 7441, 6789, 6938, 6973, 6792, 6771, 7061, 6576, 6279, 6284, 6122, 5400, 5586, 5613, 5263, 5784, 5652, 4791, 4589, 4703, 4604, 4711, 4414, 4278, 4570, 4533, 4560, 3764, 3447, 3448, 2791, 2496, 2499, 2467","repeated_count":"82","date":"11/01/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
