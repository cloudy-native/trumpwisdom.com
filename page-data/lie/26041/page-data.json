There are no actual polling places open in the city right now. And elections officials are following coronavirus safety regulations, such as those limiting the number of people indoors,” the newspaper reported. Some voters have begun to cast ballots at satellite election offices, but “poll watchers don’t have the same rights at such locations as they do at traditional polling places on Election Day, officials said.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
