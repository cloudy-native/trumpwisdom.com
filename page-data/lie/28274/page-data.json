Well, in all fairness this is a very important place, right, and we can't drag it out.

And so far, we've had a lot of good victories, and we'll continue because we're not going to let this election be taken away from us. That's the only way they're going to win it.”","analysis":"Trump baselessly lays the groundwork for his post-election claims of fraud in the Keystone State.
