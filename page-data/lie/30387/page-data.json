We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!”","analysis":"This tweet, immediately flagged by Twitter, falsely claimed that Trump was up “big” (he had never led in the Electoral College count as various news organizations called states) and, without evidence, accused Democrats of trying to steal the election. States do not allow votes to be cast after polls have closed, but some states permit the receipt of ballots as long as they are postmarked by Election Day. At the time of this tweet, not all of the votes had been counted in key states, but the outstanding votes were mainly in Democratic areas, suggesting Biden would win Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia, giving him 306 Electoral College votes and the presidency. That result was confirmed on Nov. 7. ","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/04/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
