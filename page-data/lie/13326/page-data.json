And he made a mistake. And as soon as he mentioned that, the ‘Libyan model,’ what a disaster. Take a look at what happened to Qaddafi, with the Libyan model.

And that's not a question of being tough; that's a question of being not smart, to say something like that. So I wish John the best. We actually got along very well. I'm sure he'll, you know, do whatever he can do to, you know, spin it his way.”","analysis":"Trump appears to be blaming his lack of success in nuclear negotiations with North Korea on a remark from his former national security adviser, John Bolton, which is extremely far-fetched.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
