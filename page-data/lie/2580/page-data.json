Comey had a practice of emailing his summary to a few close aides, thus creating a record and time stamp. The time between the conversation and the record of it would be an important part of establishing the memo’s credibility.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/17/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
