If you look at what's going on with the steel industry, it's almost a miracle. It was a dead industry. We need steel for defense. We need steel for a lot of things. Steel and aluminum. But those industries were in deep trouble. The steel industry was almost dead, and now it's a very vibrant, vibrant industry.”","analysis":"Trump often falsely says U.S. Steel is opening anywhere from six to nine new plants. The steel industry was not dead and is not back to life after Trump imposed steel and aluminum tariffs, although some new investments have been announced under Trump. Monthly crude steel production has been consistent since the Great Recession. Trade and economic experts say the tariffs could cost U.S. jobs.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29780, 29347, 29493, 29749, 29123, 28074, 28325, 26632, 24774, 23474, 20989, 19323, 17936, 17109, 17286, 18151, 16197, 15437, 15830, 14939, 14020, 13773, 12291, 11631, 12041, 12199, 11458, 11800, 11026, 10579, 10941, 10314, 10288, 9977, 9990, 9755, 9666, 9392, 8872, 8847, 8572, 8508, 8068, 7969, 7977, 7397, 7421, 7017, 7441, 6789, 6938, 6973, 6792, 6771, 7061, 6576, 6279, 6284, 6122, 5400, 5586, 5613, 5263, 5784, 5652, 4791, 4589, 4703, 4604, 4711, 4414, 4278, 4570, 4533, 4560, 3764, 3447, 3448, 2791, 2496, 2499, 2467","repeated_count":"82","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
