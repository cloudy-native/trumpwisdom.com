In the one model through Florida, the Great State of Alabama would have been hit or grazed. In the path it took, no. Read my FULL FEMA statement. What I said was accurate! All Fake News in order to demean!”","analysis":"By the time Trump made public comments warning that a storm could hit Alabama, forecasters had already ruled out that possibility. It is against the law to spread false weather reports.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
