And I felt so bad that I called up, I said, oh, do you have a drought?...There's no problem there. Here's a smelt, it's a little tiny fish, and it's been having difficulty over the last -- long time. With water, without water, it's having difficulty, but they want to save the smelt. And in saving the smelt, they're destroying human lives, right, and they're destroying the farmers. And even Los Angeles, the homes they got -- so they have a thing, where they're bringing it down, ultimately, to 42 gallons a person and that sounds like a lot. Look, if somebody said you could have 42 gallons a person, I think a day. It sounds like a lot of water, right? It's not, it's like a quick shower, and let's wash our hands.”","analysis":"Trump has a dim understanding of the debate in California over water supply. He suggests that water is being diverted away from the Central Valley simply to preserve a \"tiny fish\" -- the delta smelt, about three inches long. As the Los Angeles Times noted, \"the smelt is important not merely in itself but also as a bellwether of the health of the entire delta ecosystem — and the responsibility of humans as stewards of the environment is to not force species into extinction.\" If the delta smelt go, California may be able to pump some more. But then their cousins, the longfin smelt, could disappear next, and then the steelhead trout, and then the various populations of Chinook salmon. In May, 2020, a federal judge in Fresno has blocked his administration’s plan to pump more supplies through the Delta. The judge, siding with Gov. Gavin Newsom, ruled the increased pumping would harm the very fish species Trump likes to mock.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
