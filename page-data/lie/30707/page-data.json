So they were going to come out in October, but they decided to delay it because of what I'm doing.....so they waited and waited and waited. And they thought they'd come out with it a few days after the election.”","analysis":"Trump baselessly accused both Pfizer and the Food and Drug Administration of intentionally withholding news that its coronavirus vaccine candidate is more than 90 percent effective until after the presidential election, even though Pfizer did not have access to the data until the Sunday after the election.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
