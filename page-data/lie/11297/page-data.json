Iran was explicitly banned from developing a nuclear weapon. Under the deal, Iran’s declared nuclear sites, such as the Natanz uranium enrichment facility, would be under continuous monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency –and the IAEA would have immediate access.  Under the deal, for 10 years Iran will have limits on the enrichment permitted at Natanz; the IAEA will be able to keep close tabs on the production. The deal even allows IAEA monitoring of Iran’s centrifuge production and storage facilities, the procurement chain, and mining and milling of uranium—verification measures that many experts say exceed previous negotiated nuclear deals.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30535, 22007, 11408, 11243, 11297","repeated_count":"5","date":"06/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
