They're paying close to 1 percent, and they're supposed to be paying 2 percent. And the United States, over the years, got to a point where it's paying 4.3 percent, which is very unfair. And the U.S. GDP, especially under me -- because the GDP has gone up so much, because it's 4.3 of a much larger GDP. So we're paying for a big proportion of NATO, which basically is protecting Europe.”","analysis":"The NATO alliance is more than just \"protecting Europe;\" it provides strategic and diplomatic benefits for the United States as well. The NATO mission was an important part of the war in Afghanistan. NATO members have set a goal of spending at least two percent of each country gross domestic product on defense, but the spending largely does not go to NATO. The United States's defense budget is so large because it has global responsibilities.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
