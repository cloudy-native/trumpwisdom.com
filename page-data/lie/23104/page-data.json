In the last two years of the Obama administration, murder increased 30 percent in major American cities, and we witnessed the largest two-year nationwide increase in murder in over a half a century.”","analysis":"During the 2016 campaign, Trump seized on FBI data showing homicides were up 10.8 percent nationwide in 2015, which was the biggest percentage jump in a single year since 1971. But he repeatedly twisted it to say it was the “highest murder rate” in 45 years. “Criminal justice experts warn against comparing crime trends from short periods of time, such as month over month or year over year,” we noted at the time. “An annual trend can show a trajectory of where the trend might be headed but still does not give a full picture. Many criminal justice experts say crime trends are determined over at least five years, preferably 10 or 20 years, of data.” Sure enough, the rates started to go down again. In other words, the long-term trends appear to be holding, and, contrary to Trump’s campaign rhetoric, the United States was not in the middle of a crime wave before he took office. Since 1991, the murder rate has generally gone down, accounting for yearly fluctuations.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
