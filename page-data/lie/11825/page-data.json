I didn't have it, he had it. I brought the families together. I'm the one that put them together.”","analysis":"This is false. In fact, families are being separated because of a \"zero tolerance\" policy from the Trump administration dating to April 2018. No law, whether passed by Democrats or otherwise, requires these separations. During the Obama administration, there may have been some separation if there was suspicion that the children were being trafficked or a claimed parent-child relationship did not actually exist. But there was nothing like the levels we are seeing today. In fact, not only does the Trump administration continue to separate children from families in those special circumstances (danger, false parentage claim, human trafficking), the ACLU and others <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/aclu-us-has-taken-nearly-1000-child-migrants-from-their-parents-since-judge-ordered-stop-to-border-separations/2019/07/30/bde452d8-b2d5-11e9-8949-5f36ff92706e_story.html\">have argued in a court case</a> that the administration is abusing those criteria to separate many families for undeserved or arbitrary reasons. A 2021 Justice Department <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/review-department-justices-planning-and-implementation-its-zero-tolerance-policy-and-its\">Inspector General report</a> documented that the policy was implemented after pressure from Trump for more dramatic action on the southern border. After the report was released, former deputy attorney general Rod J. Rosenstein issued a statement: “It was a failed policy that never should have been proposed or implemented. I wish we all had done better.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26975, 20055, 12519, 11691, 11985, 11942, 11434, 11895, 11260, 11825, 11847, 11848, 11849, 10300, 9859, 7627, 7410, 7220, 7086, 5550, 5958, 6104, 4759, 4774, 3502","repeated_count":"25","date":"06/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
