But since then, the numbers have jumped significantly even if Trump's rhetoric has remained unchanged. September <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration\">southwest border apprehensions</a> were nearly 58,000, the highest for the month since 2006, during the Bush administration. Then the numbers soared even higher in the next two months, with more than 140,000 undocumented migrants apprehended at the southern border in October and November combined, the highest numbers for those months in almost a decade. As the numbers got worse, Trump in his rallies stopped citing statistics and instead started to use phrases such as \"the most secure border in US history.\"  Moreover, unauthorized migration “had been generally declining” from 2000 to 2017, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R46012.pdf\">according to a report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service</a>. Then it spiked in the latter half of Trump’s term, despite years of harsh rhetoric and draconian measures to stop migrants from entering the United States.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31599, 31476, 31481, 31392, 31173, 30912, 30781, 30344, 30384, 29836, 29851, 29921, 30237, 30298, 30486, 29242, 29380, 29438, 29703, 30029, 30112, 28964, 29105, 28665, 28454, 28571, 28387, 28757, 28991, 29027, 28041, 28165, 28333, 27990, 27610, 27891, 27727, 28227, 26770, 26667, 27140, 27411, 27316, 27503, 26212, 26274, 26325, 26165, 25437, 25354, 25084, 24683, 24553, 24096, 24006, 23202, 23155, 23062, 21588, 22910, 21428, 22163, 22826, 21777, 21220, 21036, 20891, 20797","repeated_count":"68","date":"11/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
