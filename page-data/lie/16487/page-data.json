Economists agree China’s industrial rise caused millions of job losses in the United States and thousands of factory closures. There’s no definitive estimate of how many of these jobs were lost, or how many of these factories closed, specifically because of China. The research on this question is limited, indicating that China had an outsized impact but that there were other factors at play, such as automation.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
