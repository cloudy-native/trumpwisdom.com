[quoting a tweet saying Sally Yates ‘was the real blackmailer’]”","analysis":"Yates, the acting attorney general for a brief period and a holdover from the Obama administration, warned Trump officials that Michael Flynn was a blackmail risk because of a lie that could be used against him. An op-ed in the New York Post argued that Yates, by raising the issue, was pushing for Flynn's firing and therefore somehow was the real blackmailer. All the evidence shows Flynn lied to the FBI, Vice President Pence and others about his contacts with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition, a period during which the FBI was investigating Russian interference in the election. Yates was never actually accused of blackmail.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/11/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
