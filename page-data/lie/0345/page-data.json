The 100 million \"forgotten\" that Trump refers to are based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data from 2015. It turns out that 93 percent do not want a job at all. The picture that emerges from a study of the data shows that the 95 million consists mostly of people who are retired, students, stay-at-home parents or disabled.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"0184","repeated_count":"1","date":"04/04/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
