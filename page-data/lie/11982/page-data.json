We're doing everything; we're finding out everything about everybody. Think of it: 15 to 20 billion dollars, and you're not allowed to ask them, ‘Are you a citizen?’”","analysis":"The Supreme Court blocked Trump from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 Census. But the ruling was based on procedural grounds. The court found that the Trump administration did not give the real reason for adding the question, as was required by law. The Commerce Department said it needed to add the question to have better data for enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. But that was a false justification, the court called it \"contrived,\" and said adding a citizenship question would be permissible if a genuine reason were given.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
