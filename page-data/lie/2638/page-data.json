That amounts to Billions of Dollars. The Failing N.Y. Times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned,” and that......does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a “lobbyist” and should so  REGISTER. If the P.O. “increased its parcel rates, Amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion.” This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!”","analysis":"The Postal Service reported a net loss in 2017, and it does offer Amazon cut rates. But that’s not the whole story. E-commerce deliveries are one of the post office’s few thriving and growing lines of business. The online retail giant clearly leverages many tools to keep the taxman at bay. That doesn’t erase its state and local tax bills, which are larger than Trump allows. Lastly, the Washington Post is owned by Jeff Bezos not Amazon.
