This is stuff that was sitting in storage houses all over the country. It wasn't even old, but it was never going to be used again. It was gathering dust. And I gave it out to all of our police forces all over the country, saved many, many police lives and many lives, I think, period. It was really a lot of it was protective equipment. And I know that President Obama and Biden didn't want to give it out. They thought it was terrible to give it out. It made the police look too strong.”","analysis":"This is overstated. The Obama administration scaled back the federal government's program of providing surplus military gear such as tanks and weapons to local police departments, a response to the images of militarized police during the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014. But Obama's restrictions clearly laid out a category of \"controlled equipment\" such as specialized firearms, manned and unmanned aircraft, explosives and riot gear that could still be provided upon demonstrated need.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
