The fact that people would just flow in like it was water, and a lot of things happened. They'd stay in. Look, when you hear -- I've been hearing 11 million; I've been 12 million; I've been hearing 35 million. For years, we've been hearing the same numbers; you've been hearing the same numbers. I used to hear 11 million all the time. It would always stay right at 11. I said, does it ever increase or go down? ‘No, it's 11.’ Nobody knows. It's probably 30, 35 million people. They would flow in mostly from the southern border. They'd come in, and nobody would talk about it, nobody would do anything about it. And a lot of problems were caused, including problems to our educational systems, to our hospital systems, to so many different things that we have.”","analysis":"The U.S. undocumented immigrant population stands at roughly 11 million to 12 million, according to a range of estimates. According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/09/14/key-findings-about-u-s-immigrants/\">Pew Research Center</a>, 8 million of those immigrants, or more than two-thirds, work for a living. Trump's revisionism is remarkable. Immigration and border issues have been a major theme of all the presidencies going back to the 1990s.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
