Well, it didn't take years to get there; very quick. And last time, we were at 3.2 and everybody was shocked. I said it's going to much higher.”","analysis":"This is wrong. Quarterly GDP growth topped 3 percent often in Barack Obama's presidency, mostly recently 2015. Trump has pledged 4 percent annual growth, which most economists think is unlikely. Trump touts the 4.2 percent quarterly growth in the second quarter of 2018 but most economists don't predict it to stay at that level or that it will produce an annual growth rate of the same pace. Plus, Obama regularly passed that rate of growth during the economic recovery.
