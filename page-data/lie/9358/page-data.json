Hasn’t been for me. I've really -- probably never will. But there are certain reasons for it, and I'll tell you. And I do this to save a little time with the press later on. John McCain received a fake and phony dossier. Did you hear about the dossier? It was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton. Right? And John McCain got it. He got it. And what did he do? He didn't call me. He turned it over to the FBI, hoping to put me in jeopardy. And that's not the nicest thing to do.”","analysis":"McCain only learned of the existence of the dossier at a conference in Halifax, Canada on Nov. 18 -- after the election -- from Andrew Wood, who had seen the documents written by Christopher Steele, a former British spy. McCain then in late November dispatched David J. Kramer, a senior director of the McCain Institute, to London to meet with Steele. Kramer returned to the U.S. with a copy of the dossier and gave it to McCain, who then gave it to the FBI. (The FBI already had a copy.) Plus, parts of the dossier have shown to be accurate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
