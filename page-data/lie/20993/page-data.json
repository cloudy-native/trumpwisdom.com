Four months later, the illegal alien robbed a 29 year old woman, mowed her down with an SUV, fracturing her skull and ruining her life. We believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not for criminal aliens.”","analysis":"Our colleagues at The New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/us/elections/fact-check-trump-criticized-a-criminal-justice-initiative-started-by-harris-and-distorted-bidens-positions.html\">fact-checked</a> this: Trump is referring to the case of Alex Izaguirre, an undocumented immigrant convicted of selling cocaine in 2008. He was a participant in Back on Track, an initiative spearheaded by Harris that placed young first-time drug offenders who pleaded guilty to their crimes into a jobs program rather than jail. In July 2008, Izaguirre snatched a woman’s purse and jumped into a car. When the woman jumped onto the hood, the driver slammed on his brakes, and the woman was thrown to the sidewalk, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2009. After she learned of the case, Harris said that Mr. Izaguirre’s inclusion in the program had been a mistake, one that she had since fixed by requiring would-be participants to provide “everything from Social Security cards to whatever it is that they can produce” to show that they were in the United States legally.\n\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
