I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor, not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.”","analysis":"Weeks after the rough transcript of the July 25 call with the Ukrainian president was released, Trump began claiming that when he said \"do us a favor\" in the call, the word \"us\" referred to the USA, not himself or his administration. This is an ex post facto explanation that strains credulity. He repeatedly requested that Ukrainian officials meet with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. In a May, 2019 letter to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky requesting a meeting, Giuliani stated he was representing Trump “as a private citizen, not as the president of the United States,” and also that Giuliani was carrying out this mission with Trump’s “knowledge and consent.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"16312, 15982, 15859, 15941, 16232, 15214, 15236, 15220, 15219","repeated_count":"9","date":"12/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
