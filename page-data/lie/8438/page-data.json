It’s being built. Some of it has already been completed. And in San Diego, if you look, it’s been completed. It’s really beautiful. Brand new.”","analysis":"The definition of a wall is a continuous structure with a common base, while a fence is something that has posts and can be seen through. There are roughly 100 miles of fencing that was funded through 2017 and 2018 appropriations that will replace smaller, less-effective structures, such as barriers made of Vietnam War-era helicopter landing mats. That’s what is happening in Calexico, near the California-Mexico border, where there were about two miles of landing-mat fencing. Officials said one problem with the landing-mat fencing is that agents could not see through to the other side. Trump here is redefining fencing as \"wall.\"\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
