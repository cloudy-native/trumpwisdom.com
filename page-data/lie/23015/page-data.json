More than 1 in 5 ballots were discarded, many multiples of the final margin,” Suraj Patel, Maloney’s opponent, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/surajpatelnyc/status/1311135111644155909\">wrote on Twitter</a>. “We called our election a canary in the coal mine for November, we were right.
