It's like a war zone. It's a great city. It's like a war zone. This is what those policies do.”","analysis":"There’s no official definition of “sanctuary,” but it generally refers to rules restricting state and local governments from alerting federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. A handful of studies looked at whether there is a causation between sanctuary cities and crime. They either found no statistically significant impact of sanctuary policies on crime, or a reduction in crime due to immigrant-friendly policing strategies. Chicago does have a high rate of gun violence, but there is no proven correlation between it's sanctuary policy and it's murder rate.
