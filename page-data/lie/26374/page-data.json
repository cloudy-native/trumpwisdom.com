He can't claim to have the biggest political crowds in U.S. history. Reagan attracted huge crowds. For instance, in 1984, a Reagan rally attracted 100,000 people to a rally in Doylestown, about two hours away from Hersey, Penna., where Trump spoke to a crowd estimated to be about 10,000 people.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/16/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
