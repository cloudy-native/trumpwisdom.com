It's going to reduce mortality by at least 35 percent; it could be much more than that. We'll see the final numbers, but it could be even higher than that.”","analysis":"Trump hyped the treatment of convalescent plasma, claiming it had been proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent,  even though the therapy has not yet been shown to be effective for covid-19. The 35 percent figure was from a subset of patients, comparing those who received plasma with a high concentration of antibodies to those who received a low concentration.   The study that produced the figure had not yet been peer-reviewed and was not a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment to a placebo. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn later apologized for mischaracterizing the results, but Trump did not and kept touting the figure.
