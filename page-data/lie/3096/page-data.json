Today, we have definitive proof that this Iranian promise was a lie.

Netanyahu said the documents proved that Iran had lied about its past nuclear efforts. Experts and U.S.-allied nations in Europe described Israel’s findings as nothing new and said they strengthened the case for the JCPOA, noting that the documents in question mostly cover the pre-2003 period, during which Iran already was known to have been pursuing nuclear weapons ambitions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/08/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
