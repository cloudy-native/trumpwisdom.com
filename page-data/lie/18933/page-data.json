In a phone call with the nation’s governors, as Kemp was making plans to lift coronavirus restrictions, Trump told the governor he was doing a “great job,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-kemp-georgia-coronavirus-reopen/2020/04/24/116f6ebe-863f-11ea-a3eb-e9fc93160703_story.html\">according to audio obtained by The Washington Post</a>. Kemp thanked Trump for working with his state and said he had spoken to the president and Vice President Pence about reopening Georgia’s economy and was trying to emulate Trump’s approach. “Our folks are really looking forward to that.
