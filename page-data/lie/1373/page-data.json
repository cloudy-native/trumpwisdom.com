And I bought a list for you.  Look at these -- look at these insurance companies.  This is since Obamacare started.  Anthem, big company, 270 percent increase.  270 percent.  And that’s since ACA, that’s Obamacare.  So since Obamacare, Humana, 420 percent increase.  Aetna, 470 percent increase.  Cigna, 480 percent increase. Insurance companies are making a fortune.”","analysis":"This claim is false. Insurance companies have actually lost billions in the Obamacare exchanges, according to company filings and industry analysts. For example, Aetna is on pace to lose $750 million from its participation in the exchanges — $100 million in 2014, $150 million in 2015, $300 million in 2016 and more than $200 million in 2017. As a result, it is not participating in 2018, a spokesman said. Humana announced it would leave the exchanges, saying it was too risky after losing $45 million in the individual market in 2017.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"1372, 1425, 1370, 1373, 1403, 1404, 1438, 1371, 1470","repeated_count":"9","date":"10/17/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
