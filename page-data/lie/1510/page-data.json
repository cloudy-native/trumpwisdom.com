When I talk to the leaders of other countries – I speak to them all the time – they’re unhappy about 7 or 8 points of growth – GDP [gross domestic product]. I spoke to a leader of a major, major country recently. Big, big country. They say our country is very big, it’s hard to grow. Well believe me this country is very big. How are you doing, I said. ‘Cause I have very good relationships believe it or not with the leaders of these countries. I said, how are you doing? He said ‘not good, not good at all. Our GDP is 7 percent.’ I say 7 percent? Then I speak to another one. ‘Not good. Not good. Our GDP is only 9 percent.’”","analysis":"Trump is making a major economic error in comparing the GDP of a developed country to a developing one. By a process of elimination, it is possible the prime minister of India is the world leader who is unhappy with 7 percent growth rate. (He’s probably even unhappier now that growth appears to be slowing.) Certainly, Trump has expressed interest in rivaling India’s growth. That’s one world leader. But the world leader who Trump claims is unhappy with 8 percent growth appears to be a phantom. Of the 58 heads of state he’s met or spoke with since taking office, not one can claim 9 percent GDP growth.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"1507, 1511","repeated_count":"2","date":"09/06/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
