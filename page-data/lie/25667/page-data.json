While the Obama administration did not send lethal aid, it in 2015 provided Ukraine more than $120 million in security assistance for Ukraine and had pledged an additional $75 million worth of equipment including UAVs, armored Humvee vehicles, counter-mortar radars, night vision devices and medical supplies, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dsca.mil/news-media/news-archive/first-us-armored-hmmwvs-arrive-ukraine-greeted-president-poroshenko\">according to the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency</a>. Many of these same items were provided by the Trump administration. One issue the Obama administration faced is that U.S. officials were concerned the Ukrainian military did not have the capability to handle weapons such as Javelin anti-tank missiles, but it achieved that capability by the time Trump became president.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"26947, 25667, 25379, 24757, 24525, 24203, 23438, 23556, 21110, 20774, 16729, 14835, 15754, 13407, 13177, 12546, 12831","repeated_count":"17","date":"10/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
