Why didn't they take it? How can the DNC say, ‘Get out of here’? They threw them out of the office.”","analysis":"The FBI and the Democratic National Committee disagree on whether the FBI requested access to the DNC's servers. FBI Director James Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the bureau made \"multiple requests at different levels\" to access DNC's servers, but the DNC said the FBI never requested access. The DNC ultimately allowed a private company to review its database and share findings with the FBI, which then FBI Director said was sufficient.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"19719, 16119, 13889, 14907, 14176, 13993, 11191, 10142, 7214, 4612, 4198, 3789, 3636, 4090, 3224, 2935, 2777, 1584, 1019, 0766, 0763, 7222, 0554, 0504, 13891, 0206","repeated_count":"26","date":"07/01/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
