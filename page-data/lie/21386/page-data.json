It is not possible she could have known so little about Dirty Cop James Comey (and others) from her high position in the Department of 'Justice'. The political Crime of the Century, and she had no idea what they were doing?”","analysis":"Trump has concocted a series of conspiracy theories about Obama spying on his campaign, which he sometimes labels \"Obamagate.\" Now Trump is focused on a January 2017 meeting that Obama held in the Oval Office with then FBI director James Comey, Vice President Joe Biden, national security adviser Susan Rice and Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general. Rice indicated in an email that Obama was primarily concerned with whether limits should be placed on classified information that was shared with the incoming team, in particular incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn, in light of the intercepts of the calls between Flynn and the Russian ambassador. Although presidents generally are expected not to inquire about criminal investigations, it is appropriate to have a discussion about a counterintelligence probe, as that involves national security. Somehow, without much explanation, Trump has turned this meeting into a high crime that he considers to be treason. There is no indication that Yates is lying in her testimony.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/06/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
