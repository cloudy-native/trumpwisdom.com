And the family income of all families was increasing more and more, and it was a beautiful sight to behold.”","analysis":"Trump heaped praise on Reagan’s Tax Reform Act of 1986, which simplified tax brackets and eliminated tax shelters; it also lowered the top individual tax rate to 28 percent but raised the capital gains rate to the same level, giving them parity. But this is a rather strange flip-flop because Trump always has been a fierce critic of the bill, blaming it repeatedly for the savings and loan crisis, a decline in real estate investing and the 1990-1991 recession. “This tax act was just an absolute catastrophe for the country, for the real estate industry, and I really hope that something can be done,” Trump told Congress in 1991. In a television interview with Joan Rivers, he said: “What caused the savings and loan crisis was the 1986 tax law change. It was a disaster. It took all of the incentives away from investors.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"1463, 1265, 1253, 1116, 1106","repeated_count":"5","date":"09/27/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
