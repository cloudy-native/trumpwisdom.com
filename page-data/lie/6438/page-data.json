Just one after another after another. And I always say, if just one person had a gun, where the bullets could have flown the other way, you wouldn't have had that tragedy like that.”","analysis":"The November 2015 Paris attacks were a series of coordinated terrorist attacks. The attackers killed 130 people, including 90 at the Bataclan theatre. Another 413 people were injured. Three groups, comprising three men each, executed the attacks, so it's unclear what one person with a gun might have done. When police launched an assault, two attackers at the theater died by detonating their suicide vests.","pinocchios":"","category":"Terrorism","repeated_ids":"10839, 10201, 6438","repeated_count":"3","date":"10/27/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
