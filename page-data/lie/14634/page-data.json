The ceasefire is holding very much so, and I think people are surprised. And maybe, someday, they'll give me credit, but probably not. But that worked out well. They've been trying to do this for a hundred years. That border is a mess for a long time.”","analysis":"There's no basis for Trump's claim about the Turkish-Kurd ceasefire. This was only a five-day ceasefire. At various times he has suggested that \"everyone\" has been trying to get this deal for \"10 years,\" \"15 years\" or even \"decades.\" Experts said Trump's statement was nonsense, but it's typical of how he tries to spin minor events into earth-shattering achievements. In this case, the ceasefire was necessary because Trump removed U.S. troops, allowing for an invasion of Kurdish areas in Syria  by Turkish forces.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"14634, 14344, 14117, 14270, 14508, 14511, 14517, 14520, 14572, 14642","repeated_count":"10","date":"12/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
