China, there, is considered a developing nation. If you're a developing nation, you get massive tax advantages and other advantages. Well, I want the United States to be a developing nation then, okay? We should get the same advantages as China gets. Why should China get advantages over the United States? Because they got somebody to say they're a developing nation.”","analysis":"China is far less developed than traditionally developed countries. In purchasing power terms, its standard of living is about one-third that of the United States. China insisted on being labeled a developing country when it joined the WTO, which gives it certain advantages. (There is no definition of a developing country under WTO rules but countries self-designate.) But the WTO has not treated China like other developing countries, given its size, and so it had not received all of the advantages of being called a developing country. Trump's suggestion the US should be considered a developing country is ridiculous.
