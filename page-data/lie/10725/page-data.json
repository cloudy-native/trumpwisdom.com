There have been no ballistic missiles going out. There have been no long-range missiles going out. ....A lot of good things are happening. And, very importantly, there's been no nuclear testing for two years. I looked at a chart the other day. During the past administration, there were many numbers that were very high, like 10 and 12 and 18, having to do with missile launches and nuclear testing.”","analysis":"Trump tried to dismiss North Korea's test as not a ballistic missile test, but the Japanese prime minister contradicted him at the same news conference: \"On the 9th of May, North Korea launched a short-range ballistic missile. This is violating the Security Council resolution.\" Trump's aides agreed, with National Security Advisor John Bolton saying: \"The U.N. Security Council resolution prohibits the launch of any ballistic missiles and there is no doubt that North Korea has violated the resolution.\" Trump was unmoved: \"People think it could have been a violation, as you know. I view it differently. I view it as a man -- perhaps he wants to get attention, and perhaps not. Who knows? It doesn't matter.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
