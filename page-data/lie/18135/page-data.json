When India sends motorcycles into the U.S., there is virtually no tariff.”","analysis":"The president is referring to a favorite example of his — Harley-Davidson motorcycles. India recently announced it would reduce the duties from 100 percent to 50 percent, but Harley already got around that higher duty by assembling in India most of the 4,500 motorcycles sold in the country. Harley, for its part, says it is indifferent to the matter and has no objection to India’s import duties. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) also says the Wisconsin-based company opposes higher tariffs for steel and aluminum because of the potential negative impact on its sales.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"18135, 12429, 11722, 10247, 9682, 9107, 8376, 5250, 5266, 4086, 3821, 2465, 2451, 2380, 0897, 0921, 0540, 0276, 0196, 0197","repeated_count":"20","date":"02/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
