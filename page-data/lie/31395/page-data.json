We had an election that was stolen from us...There's never been a time like this where such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all of us, from me, from you, from our country. This was a fraudulent election but we can't play into the hands of these people.”","analysis":"In his video that was pitched as attempt to calm the rioters at the Capitol, Trump repeats the lie that Biden stole the election and that it was fraudulent election. Biden won a solid victory in the Electoral College, 306-232, and won a majority of the popular vote, beating Trump by more than 7 million votes.  When Trump posted the video on Twitter, it was originally labeled: \"This claim of election fraud is disputed, and this Tweet can’t be replied to, Retweeted, or liked due to a risk of violence.\" Then Twitter removed the video from its platform completely, a prelude to permanently deleting Trump's account.
