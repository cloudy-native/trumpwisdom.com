I would be the greatest that ever lived. The President of the United States, all I have to do is, give me a list of the top 100 companies, I'll call the president of every one. They will pay me whatever I want. I would set every record. The problem is, I'd owe them because when they call and they have a problem for a lot more money than we're talking about -- you know, it's like hard to say, hey, they were nice, they treated you good. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. We don't need the money. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do it, but when you see them raise $300 million; $350 million in a month and a half, you know deals are being made, just say you understand. Deals are being made, big deals, deals -- I mean, look at the deals that he's making for himself, OK, but deals are being made.”","analysis":"Without evidence, Trump suggests Biden is guilty of corruption because he is raising so much more money than the president.

Nearly 1.9 million women donated to Biden’s campaign — compared to roughly 505,000 for Trump — accounting for 47 percent of his total fundraising.\" Sometimes, Trump spins a tale about he could easily raise millions of dollars with a single phone call to a corporate executive -- transactions that would violate campaign finance limits.
