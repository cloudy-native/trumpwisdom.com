Presidency becomes even more important. We will win!”","analysis":"Trump appears to be suggesting a Democratic administration would abolish policies banning abortion. While some states have very restrictive laws, no state is able to fully ban the procedure because of the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. A Biden administration might push for federal guidelines on these restrictions, but cannot “end” something that does not currently exist.   This, of course, assumes the president is referring to “the right to life,” a commonly used expression by anti abortion advocates. If he is suggesting that Democrats would end life as we know it, that is simply ridiculous.
