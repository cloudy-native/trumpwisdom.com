U.S. Marshals. We were waiting for local government to take care of it, but they didn't do that, so the U.S. Marshals went in -- law enforcement. They took down the Antifa member who murdered a man in the middle of a street in Portland. The suspect was killed after drawing a weapon, when officers attempted to take him into custody. They wanted to take him in -- the U.S. Marshals, incredible people.”","analysis":"A New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/us/michael-reinoehl-antifa-portland-shooting.html\">investigation</a> painted a different picture of what happened when the Marshals approached Michael Reinoehl who was suspected of fatally shooting a far-right protester. The Times wrote, “In interviews with 22 people who were near the scene, all but one said they did not hear officers identify themselves or give any commands before opening fire. In their official statements, not yet made public, the officers offered differing accounts of whether they saw Mr. Reinoehl with a weapon. One told investigators he thought he saw Mr. Reinoehl raise a gun inside the vehicle before the firing began, but two others said they did not.” Moreover, the task force that was involved included a mix of U.S. Marshals with state and local law enforcement.
