Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!”","analysis":"Trump, perhaps wary of planned protests if he visited London, came up with a phony excuse. While he blamed Obama, the decision to move the embassy was made and announced during the George W. Bush administration. The price that could be obtained for the old embassy was limited because it was named an historic building and thus cannot be significantly changed. Nevertheless, the entire cost-- about $1 billion, not $1.2 billion --  was financed through the sale of the existing chancery and other buildings.
