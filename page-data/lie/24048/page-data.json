But they're sending ballots all over the place. No, I don't think that's good, because it's proven to be people that don't even want a ballot end up getting a ballot. They don't even know what to do with it. And what happens is people take those ballots, and there's great fraud, and that's been proven.”","analysis":"A distinction without a difference. “Absentee ballots” and “mail-in ballots” are interchangeable terms. State officials use safeguards such as bar codes and signature matching to ensure the authenticity of all ballots cast by mail. For the purposes of ballot verification, it makes no difference whether someone mailed an absentee ballot or dropped it off in person. It doesn't matter whether a voter had an excuse to vote by mail, such as military service, or not. All voters must identify themselves to register to vote and then submit ballots to local officials for verification. Safety measures to verify their authenticity include signature verification, barcode scanning and in some states, a sworn affidavit signed by a witness.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"24495, 24318, 24141, 24048, 23896, 23008, 23032, 22760, 22763, 22865, 22732, 22564","repeated_count":"12","date":"09/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
