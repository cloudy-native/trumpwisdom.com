You know, anybody know what $1.8 billion in -- in cash looks like?”","analysis":" Trump’s reference to $1.8 billion refers to the timing of a settlement of a long-standing claim regarding undelivered aircraft made by Iran on the same day four American detainees, including The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian, were released. A jumbo jet carrying $400 million in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies landed in Tehran as the detainees flew off. That money purportedly was partial payment of an outstanding claim by Iran for U.S. military equipment that was never delivered. Soon after, $1.3 billion in cash followed. State Department officials have insisted that the negotiations over the claims and detainees were not connected but came together at the same time, with the cash payment used as “leverage” to ensure the release of detainees. Moreover, he’s wrong to claim, yet again, that Obama paid Iran $150 billion. Trump always makes it sound like this is U.S. taxpayer money — and he always uses a too-high estimate. Because of international sanctions over its nuclear program, Iran had billions of dollars in assets that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe. With sanctions lifted, in theory those funds would be unlocked. But the Treasury Department estimated that once Iran fulfills other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. (Much of the other money was obligated to illiquid projects in China.) For its part, the Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion, not $55 billion.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30974, 29451, 29546, 29686, 29966, 30132, 29047, 28669, 28463, 28213, 28805, 28997, 28083, 28174, 28342, 28001, 27685, 27870, 28237, 26841, 27149, 27327, 27516, 26382, 26470, 26219, 26124, 25702, 25575, 25525, 25328, 25392, 26577, 25918, 25123, 25057, 24935, 24754, 24861, 24736, 24640, 24389, 24326, 24197, 24100, 23907, 23797, 23854, 23667, 23487, 23272, 23066, 22005, 22380, 21635, 21566, 22477, 22986, 22991, 22125, 21499, 21423, 20535, 20099, 20043, 19496, 18092, 17760, 16509, 16410, 16639, 16123, 16124, 16165, 16396, 16077, 16079, 14159, 14444, 15222, 13600, 12704, 13123, 13255, 12397, 11615, 12201, 11404, 11317, 11973, 11312, 11947, 11445, 11883, 11244, 11878, 11295, 11210, 11742, 11123, 10826, 10271, 9901, 9722, 8583, 7944, 7562, 7277, 6837, 6124, 6325, 5324, 5533, 5833, 5777, 5728, 4974, 4723, 3351, 3079, 3112, 3016, 2983, 2924, 2903, 2908, 2721, 2375, 2089, 1989, 1471, 1394, 1015, 0896, 0061, 0046","repeated_count":"136","date":"11/03/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
