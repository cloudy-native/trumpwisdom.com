This would have taken, I wouldn't say years, maybe not many years, but it would would have taken a long time to have gotten it approved. We got the FDA to do it very quickly. So now we have another therapeutic, and it's really been effective. So I just want to thank convalescent plasma, but you know that, convalescent plasma, and hopefully you won't need it.”","analysis":"Trump hyped the treatment of convalescent plasma, claiming it had been proven to reduce mortality by 35 percent,  even though the therapy has not yet been shown to be effective for covid-19. The 35 percent figure was from a subset of patients, comparing those who received plasma with a high concentration of antibodies to those who received a low concentration.   The study that produced the figure had not yet been peer-reviewed and was not a randomized controlled trial comparing treatment to a placebo. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn later apologized for mischaracterizing the results, but Trump did not and kept touting the figure.
