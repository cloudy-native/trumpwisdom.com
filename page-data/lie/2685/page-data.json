Focusing on one poll is not very informative. The 538 average has Trump at a 40.4 percent approval rating on April 3, 2018, compared to 48.3 percent for Obama on April 3, 2010.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"28021, 28137, 28281, 27049, 24988, 25134, 24708, 24589, 24162, 22040, 21007, 21543, 22136, 21343, 21760, 21383, 21375, 17861, 16957, 16988, 16602, 16060, 15896, 15017, 15761, 15627, 14218, 13760, 13196, 12807, 12813, 12924, 11473, 11148, 11008, 10315, 10124, 9914, 9664, 9480, 9307, 8913, 8812, 8858, 8676, 8683, 8708, 8606, 7267, 7545, 7006, 5561, 5317, 4738, 2726, 2685, 2625, 2281, 1870, 1492, 0662, 0667, 0665, 0087","repeated_count":"64","date":"04/03/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
