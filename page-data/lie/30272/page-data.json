They're fighting, killing each other. You've read it. I  mean, for years it, it just automatic, killing each other for many, many decades. And we're doing these trade deals with them, not big deals, but they want them very badly, we're doing them...Some people have never heard of the places. But they're places and they're people, they're human beings.”","analysis":"Trump falsely-- and bizarrely -- takes credit for ending a war between Serbia and Kosovo that ended more than two decades ago. Despite continued tensions, the two sides have not directly fought each other since 1999.
