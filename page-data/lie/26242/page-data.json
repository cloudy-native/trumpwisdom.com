You look at worst -- the worst, I mean, they talk J. Edgar Hoover, this guy was worse, just not as smart. J. Edgar Hoover was smart, this one's a dummy. But if you look at Comey and you look at what he did so bad, he lied, he leaked, he lied before Congress.”","analysis":"Trump disputes Comey's version of events, especially that the president pressed the former FBI director on a pledge of loyalty, but there is no evidence Comey lied about that incident. Comey kept detailed notes and told others about the conversation. The document that Comey \"leaked\" was his memo on the conversation, and he released it to the press after he was fired.  Comey said he intentionally wrote these notes about this conversation in a way that the information wouldn't be classified. The Justice Department Inspector General found no evidence that Comey leaked classified information to the media. Trump himself revealed these conversations existed in his letter firing Comey. Moreover, the Special Counsel's report found Comey's account to be credible: \"Corney's memory of the details of the dinner, including that the President requested loyalty, has remained consistent throughout.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"30765, 29239, 26242, 26598, 26599, 26608, 23343, 22328, 21052, 21340, 20879, 20861, 20809, 16075, 12638, 11675, 11182, 9579, 9444, 8017, 8132, 7274, 7582, 7585, 7590, 6075, 4610, 4454, 4356, 4405, 2988, 2927, 2677, 2679, 2681, 2083, 1585","repeated_count":"37","date":"10/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
