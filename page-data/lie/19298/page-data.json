And I gave 12 billion the year before and I gave 16 billion last year [to farmers], and we're giving 19 billion this year. Nobody ever did that.”","analysis":"Trump makes these payments seem like a gift. In fact, the China tariff revenue isn't \"left over\" but has been largely eaten up by payments the government has made to farmers who lost business because China stopped buying U.S. soybeans, hogs, cotton and other products in response. As of December 2018, the government said it will cut nearly $9.6 billion in checks, including $7.3 billion to soybean farmers, $580 million to pork farmers and $554 million to cotton farmers; at the time, only about $8 billion had been collected on Chinese goods. Trump then announced an additional bailout for farmers of $16 billion in 2019, for a total of $28 billion. No one may have provided this kind of subsidy because the market had not not seen this level of disruption.
