Politicians prospered, but the jobs left, and the factories closed.”","analysis":"The suburbs around Washington are among the richest in the United States, largely because of the federal government (which attracts people with college or advanced degrees). Among the 25 most populous metropolitan areas, the D.C. metro area has the highest median income in the nation -- $93,294 versus a U.S. median of $55,775 -- though growth has slowed in recent years, in part because of reductions in defense spending. Indeed, income in the D.C. area has grown essentially at the same rate as the rest of the nation since 2006, including a dip in median income during the Great Recession. But there is no empirical evidence that the D.C. area got rich off the rest of the country, as Trump suggests.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/20/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
