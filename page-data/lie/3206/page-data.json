The official Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate for black youth at the time was 19.2 percent — about one-third of the rate used by Trump. Now that he’s president, Trump appears all too happy to cite the unemployment rate for African Americans, bragging that it’s the best in history. We're pleased the president is now using accurate statistics but it’s silly to suggest, as he does to audiences, that he had much to do with these numbers.
