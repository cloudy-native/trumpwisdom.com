When I became President, and before that, as you know, it was all the time: nuclear testing, ballistic missile testing. And now there’s nothing.

But experts say and satellite imagery indicates that North Korea continues to pursue a nuclear program. The Washington Post reported that U.S. spy agencies are seeing signs that North Korea is constructing new missiles at a factory that produced the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. Even the president's national security advisor, John Bolton, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-national-security-adviser-john-bolton-on-face-the-nation-march-3-2019/\">said</a> North Korea continues to make the fuel needed for nuclear weapons and testing missiles in violation of sanctions.
