As governor, Vice President Pence did make the largest income tax cut in Indiana’s history — but he didn’t have a very high bar to overcome, and it was a modest cut. Prior to Pence, there was only one time the income tax was cut without an offsetting increase, in the 1970s. Moreover, Indiana’s individual income-tax rate was already the second-lowest in the nation when Pence took office.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/27/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
