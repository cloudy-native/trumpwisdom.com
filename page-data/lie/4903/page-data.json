The day after Trump’s \"animals\" comment, on May 17, House Democratic leader Pelosi said \"calling people animals is not a good thing\" and defended \"undocumented immigrants.” She was speaking more generally about undocumented immigrants, not MS-13, before Trump issued his clarification. She did not yell.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"20036, 16202, 16356, 15524, 12763, 12103, 7123, 7158, 5313, 5761, 4903","repeated_count":"11","date":"09/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
