We picked up two; we went from 51 to 53. Nobody knows that.”","analysis":"The Republican candidates Trump backed in Louisiana would go on to lose to incumbent Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) despite several Trump rallies in the state. There was extensive coverage of the Senate races in 2018. There is little historic about a one-seat gain in the Senate; Republicans had started the session with 52 seats.
