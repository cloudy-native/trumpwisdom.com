The senator has proposed an expansion of Social Security, not an end to 401(k) plans. The Sanders proposal includes higher base benefits and cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security recipients. His proposal would lift the current cap on payroll taxes, which is $132,900. Sanders would subject all income above $250,000 to the 12.4 percent Social Security payroll tax, among other measures.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
