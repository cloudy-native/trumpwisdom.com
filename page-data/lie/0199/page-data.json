Nancy Pelosi's 2010 meeting with then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Sessions, a Trump campaign surrogate, misled Congress by not disclosing that he met with Kislyak on at least two occasions during the 2016 presidential campaign, including one private meeting at Sessions's Senate office. Pelosi and other House leaders met with Medvedev, who brought Kislyak and other top Russian officials to the meeting.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/03/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
