They just didn't know that it was going to be that tough, because we were leading in every swing state by so much, far greater than they ever thought possible. While it has long been understood that the Democrat political machine engages in voter fraud, from Detroit to Philadelphia to Milwaukee, Atlanta, so many other places, what changed this year was the Democrat party's relentlessly push to print and mail out tens of millions of ballots, sent to unknown recipients with virtually no safeguards of any kind....This colossal expansion of mail-in voting opened the floodgates to massive fraud.”","analysis":"Most states use barcodes on mail-in ballots matched to a specific person in the voter files; ballot envelopes require personal information, such as date of birth or driver’s license numbers; and signatures are required and matched against ones on file. Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Georgia were not among that nine states that sent mail-in ballots to all registered voters.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
