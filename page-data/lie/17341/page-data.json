It was an executive order. And when he signed it, he said -- essentially, he said, 'I don't have the right to do this, but I'm going to do it anyway.'

This is a temporary stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people.\" That's different from saying he didn't have a right to sign it. His administration argued in court that the order was “a lawful exercise of the enforcement discretion that Congress delegated to the executive branch in the Immigration and Nationality Act, which charges the executive with ‘the administration and enforcement’ of the country’s immigration laws,” as the ACLU put it.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
