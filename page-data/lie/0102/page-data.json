Gang members, drug dealers & others are being removed!”","analysis":"Trump is referring to the recent arrests of undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes (“criminal aliens”). Trump takes credit for fulfilling his campaign promise of cracking down on illegal immigration, but these arrests are routine. ICE has always targeted dangerous criminals in enforcement priorities. The recent arrests, however, did include people who would not have fallen under narrowed enforcement priorities under Obama. Still, 25 percent of the arrests were of people who had lesser charges and noncriminal convictions and are not the gang members or drug dealers that he describes.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"0270, 0166, 0181, 0161, 0145, 0136, 0084","repeated_count":"7","date":"02/12/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
