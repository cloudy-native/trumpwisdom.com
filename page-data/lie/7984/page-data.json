Not easy. Everyone files right in the Ninth Circuit.”","analysis":"The 9th Circuit rules in favor of the Trump administration often. The reversal rate is largely meaningless because the Supreme Court rarely takes cases to affirm the rulings from lower courts. In any case, the 9th Circuit is not the most overturned court by the annual reversal rate. It does have a high raw number of reversals or number of cases on the Supreme Court docket. But it also reviews more cases than other circuits, is larger than other circuits and terminates far more cases than other circuits.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
