They are leaving fast.”","analysis":"A dubious report issued by Department of Health and Human Services did not say 2 million people dropped out. Instead, it said that 10.3 million had paid for their first premium in February as of March 15, compared with 12.2 million who had signed up for coverage as of Jan. 31. But because of the dates selected by HHS, at least 500,000 who made their first payment in March were likely missed. The individual market has always had a lot of flux – people drop out when they get a job that provides health insurance – so the attrition rate likely would not have been unusual if HHS had not manipulated the numbers.
