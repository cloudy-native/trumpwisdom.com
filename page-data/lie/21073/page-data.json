Few countries have it. But the United States doesn't have it. Never did. Probably never even asked for it, because they didn't know what they were doing.”","analysis":"“Most favored” trading status is one of those confusing inside-the-Beltway terms that apparently the president still does not understand. It just means normal trading relations. In the case of China, normal trade relations were suspended in 1951 after the communist takeover and then restored in 1980 on a rolling basis. Bill Clinton led the way for permanent resumption of normal trading status, not Joe Biden, and it was George W. Bush who established it in 2001.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"21775, 21073","repeated_count":"2","date":"07/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
