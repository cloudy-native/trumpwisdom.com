Despite Trump's frequent efforts to suggest otherwise, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was not a supporter. So these claims are based on a retracted FAQ about a nonbinding resolution. In these documents, proponents of the Green New Deal mused about ending air travel. Problematic as those lines were, none made it into the resolution. High-speed rail would become an airplane alternative for some travelers under the terms of the Green New Deal, but it wouldn't end commercial air travel. Travelers who prefer flights over high-speed rail would still have a choice. Trump often cites a $100 trillion estimate, which comes from a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.americanactionforum.org/research/the-green-new-deal-scope-scale-and-implications/\">Republican-aligned think tank</a>. It's actually $93 trillion, and it factors in things that are not in the resolution, such as building high-speed rail at a scale where air travel becomes unnecessary. Indeed, more than 80 percent estimate was for social programs such as health care, not for clean energy and climate policies. A more reasonable estimate for the energy portion of the plan is $18 trillion, spread over 30 years.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30947, 29481, 29087, 28444, 27661, 28858, 28016, 28106, 28265, 27801, 27628, 26956, 26628, 27085, 27336, 26371, 26396, 26095, 26159, 25530, 25163, 26539, 26002, 24409, 24184, 24091, 23465, 23117, 22449, 22292, 22908, 20867, 21903, 22691, 21514, 20053, 20282, 18570, 16839, 16210, 16441, 15705, 14141, 13650, 12759, 11047, 11792, 10486, 10513, 10887, 10264, 10171, 9883, 9712, 9531, 9588, 9075, 9128, 9043, 8730, 8670","repeated_count":"61","date":"09/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
