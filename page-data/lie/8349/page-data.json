Think of LBJ, he gave people food stamps & welfare. Donald Trump’s giving them a job. He’s got a lot of good things to talk about. News stories do not accurately cover him, should correct.” @DougWead","analysis":"President Trump has a habit of touting his job numbers, but in many ways he's building on a trend that already existed. The economy added more jobs in every year of Obama’s second term than it did in Trump’s first year. Job growth did, however, surpass projections made by the Congressional Budget Office before Trump took office, but as regular readers know, the U.S. economy is complex and the decisions of companies and consumers often loom larger than the acts of any president.
