Just tell me, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena from the United States Congress, right, people go to jail for doing it under a civil case. They delete 33,000 e- mails.”","analysis":"Trump’s claim suggests the State Department had sole approval authority on a uranium rights deal with a company largely owned by Russia’s nuclear energy agency. But the State Department is one of nine agencies in the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States to vet and sign off on all U.S. transactions involving foreign governments. As we’ve noted before, there is no evidence Clinton herself got involved in the deal personally, and it is highly questionable that this deal even rose to the level of the secretary of state. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also needed to approve, and did approve, the transfer. There’s no evidence Clinton deleted these 33,000 emails in anticipation of receiving a subpoena, and Comey has said the FBI’s investigation found no evidence that any work-related emails were “intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.” Clinton’s staff had requested that these emails be deleted months before they received a subpoena, according to the FBI’s July 2016 statement.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"14920, 4091, 1558, 1329, 1031, 0923, 0857, 0952, 0502, 0332, 0323, 0098","repeated_count":"12","date":"07/01/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
