Trump also got the math wrong on these ICE totals over two fiscal years. Days later, he began to use the correct the figure: 266,000. Notice how Trump switches quickly from the total for arrests over two years to the total for charges and convictions: “100,000 for assault, 30,000 for sex crimes, and 4,000 for homicides.” These numbers for arrests and legal charges are apples and oranges, and by switching from one to the other, Trump confuses the issue and exaggerates the criminality. In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, and not all charges result in convictions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
