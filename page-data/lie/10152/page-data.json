Mueller cited several reasons for not reaching a decision on obstruction charges, including a Justice Department policy that bars the indictment of a sitting president and Mueller's intention not to get in the way of potential impeachment proceedings in Congress. Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein reviewed the evidence on obstruction and found that Trump did not break the law. Barr said he did not think Mueller intended to leave the decision to Congress. Mueller's report does not make an explicit recommendation on impeachment, but it does lay it out as an option.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
