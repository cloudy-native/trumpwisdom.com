But think of this, he's in control of millions of votes. Here's a guy calling venues telling them not to have the rally, calling different venues, don't have the rally. … And this is the guy that we're entrusting with millions of ballots, unsolicited ballots, millions and millions and then we're supposed to win these states?”","analysis":"This is doubly false. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) did not call venues to block Trump from holding a rally. Two indoor venues separately declined the Trump campaign's entreaties because of the state's 50-person limit on indoor gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump eventually held his rally at an outdoor venue. The governor does not run elections in Nevada. That job falls to the secretary of state, which in 2020 was Republican Barbara Cegavske.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
