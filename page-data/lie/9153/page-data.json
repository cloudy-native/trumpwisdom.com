It was one hangar. They had three other hangars that were full. They went so far back.”","analysis":"Trump says he filled airport hangars — not one but four! — during a rally with Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp in Georgia. He previously claimed it was two hangars. But there was only one hangar. The crowd at this event was divided in three: the people inside, the people just outside the open hangar, and a third group watching a TV screen on a different part of the premises, sandwiched between the airport and a corporate office. Kemp’s campaign estimated that 10,000 people attended in total, and the Bibb County Sheriff’s Office estimated 12,500 inside and nearly 6,000 outside, according to a fact-check by WMAZ. The overflow crowd sandwiched between the airport and the corporate office numbered in the “hundreds,” according to Atlanta magazine. The most generous tally, 18,500, is a far cry from the 55,000 Trump claimed.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"30333, 30165, 30318, 29414, 28355, 28722, 29019, 27930, 27696, 27032, 26742, 26792, 26724, 27263, 26902, 27177, 25959, 25981, 25783, 25085, 23634, 21885, 21762, 19473, 18482, 18066, 18116, 18388, 17422, 17471, 18337, 17282, 17356, 16500, 16455, 16270, 16277, 16321, 14959, 14323, 14653, 15059, 15092, 13783, 13238, 12469, 12449, 12381, 11602, 11671, 12091, 12108, 12020, 12021, 11930, 11873, 11874, 11165, 11768, 11157, 10588, 10628, 10696, 10544, 10854, 10225, 9499, 9091, 9093, 9094, 9153, 8286, 8170, 7012, 7013, 7434, 7460, 6704, 6705, 6708, 6868, 6944, 7095, 6662, 6524, 6758, 6217, 6247, 6328, 6336, 6346, 6408, 6169, 5488, 5871, 5889, 5446, 5559, 6064, 5076, 5560, 5575, 5502, 5507, 5189, 5235, 5236, 5237, 5179, 5180","repeated_count":"110","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
