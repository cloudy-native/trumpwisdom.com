The claim is ridiculous, as the governor does not run elections in Nevada. That job falls to the secretary of state, which in 2020 was Republican Barbara Cegavske. There is no evidence of voter fraud on any significant scale in Nevada.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"24322, 24174, 24263, 24139, 24168, 24041, 24044, 24046, 24070, 23918","repeated_count":"10","date":"09/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
