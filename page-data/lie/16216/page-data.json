So, they have this Army tank plant right, in Lima, and I said, what's going on? They're closing it. I said oh, they are? Well, you know, -- they're closing everything. When I came in they want to close everything. So, I was President-elect. I think, right around that time and I went to Lima. I went through the factory where they make these trucks, the plant, and they make the tanks and they make all of these armored vehicles, and I said these people are amazing. You could never close this. You could never reopen it again. They'd been doing this for many, many decades, and this factory was incredible, and I looked at the tanks they were making, they're the best in the world, right? The Abrams, they're the best in the world. I said wait a minute if you close this, we're not going to be able -- where are you going to build tanks? This is the primary factory in the whole country. I think it might be the only factory in the whole country....I said keep it open. I actually -- it was all closed. Does every -- anybody from Lima? Is that the truth there? Right, right? It was closed, they announced it was closed. It was all set to close. I said you can't close this plant....So, that was something I did that I'm very proud of because I really overrode a lot of talented people that wanted to close it.”","analysis":"This story is a fantasy, Trump has steered more funding to this tank plant in Ohio, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://breakingdefense.com/2019/03/tank-plant-trump-says-he-saved-was-never-in-danger/\">it was never in danger of closing</a>.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
