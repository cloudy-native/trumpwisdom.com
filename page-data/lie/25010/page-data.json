That's at the lowest level. So we will be matching the lowest price with what's now many times the highest price, and we won't pay a penny more. What will happen is the lower prices will come up a little bit, but you'll get discounts of 40, 50, 60, 80, 90 -- who knows? -- percent -- numbers that you wouldn't even believe.”","analysis":"Trump is hyping a largely toothless executive order. In a move widely regarded as a political play seven weeks before the election, Trump announced he had signed an executive order aiming to lower drug prices in the Medicare program through what is known as “the most favored nation policy.” If implemented, such an order would require drugmakers to accept the lowest price from the government for medicines paid by comparably wealthy countries in Europe and elsewhere — an aggressive move the pharmaceutical industry is fighting vociferously. Trump doesn't need to issue executive orders for his administration to start experimenting with new Medicare payments — but he clearly wanted to be able to claim he’s doing something on drug prices ahead of Nov. 3. (After the election, Trump announced HHS had issued an “interim final rule,\" meaning the Trump administration skipped the normal rulemaking process, which requires weeks for public comment. That could make it difficult for the Biden administration to defend the policy in court if the pharmaceutical industry sues over the rule. Indeed, in late December a federal judge issued a nationwide injunction that prevented the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, from carrying out the so-called “most favored nations” rule as scheduled on Jan. 1. The judge wrote in her temporary order that CMS had failed to follow required procedures for notice and comment before imposing such sweeping changes.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"31596, 29846, 30041, 30310, 30321, 30539, 29252, 29641, 29552, 29721, 29971, 30014, 29051, 29156, 28468, 28584, 28487, 29002, 28089, 28119, 28288, 28005, 27692, 27791, 27646, 27749, 28249, 26850, 26683, 27092, 27202, 27343, 27528, 26349, 26436, 26507, 26130, 26161, 25708, 25467, 25522, 25272, 26589, 25129, 25010, 25063, 24946, 24808, 24699, 24725, 24656, 24460, 24116, 24020, 23880, 23704, 23515, 23298, 23196, 23166, 23084, 22124, 21994, 22071, 21953, 21962, 20976, 21057, 21557, 22451, 22506, 22177, 22232, 21849, 21305, 22822, 21772, 21802, 21376, 22705, 22748, 22696, 21718, 22631, 22623","repeated_count":"85","date":"09/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
