They used it as an excuse by the Democrats for losing an election that they should have won because they have a big advantage in the Electoral College.”","analysis":"Trump earned 306 pledged electors, Clinton 232. Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million. If 40,000 votes had switched in three states, Trump would have also lost the Electoral College. Democrats obviously do not have an Electoral College lock. According to a tally by John Pitney of Claremont McKenna College, every Republican president since Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876 won a larger share of the electoral college votes than Trump, with the exception of George W. Bush (twice) and Nixon in 1968.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"21268, 16456, 14769, 14866, 14715, 11274, 9314, 8142, 8091, 6878, 5941, 5956, 5591, 5111, 4888, 4310, 3866, 3786, 3043, 2941, 2771, 2513, 2426, 2081, 2110, 1550, 1417, 1199, 0886, 0639, 0560, 0397","repeated_count":"32","date":"11/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
