Now we have increased net farm incomes -- and this is during negotiations of these tough deals -- by $4 billion.”","analysis":"Trump is correct that farm income fell steadily from 2013 before rebounding in 2017, according to USDA’s Economic Research Service. “U.S. farm income experienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 due to strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports,” according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. However, national net farm income in 2018 is forecast to drop 13 percent from 2017, not counting Trump's bailout for farmers hurt by his tariffs. Adjusting for inflation, that would bring income levels to around 15-year lows.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/27/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
