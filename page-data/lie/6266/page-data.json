And then it turned out that he took the picture five hours before the people started coming into the arena. The arena was packed and there were thousands of people outside. They had to retract it. But this is the kind of dishonesty that we have.”","analysis":"Trump is making a mountain out of a tweet. Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel tweeted a photo of a nearly empty arena, but he quickly deleted it after he was informed it was from hours earlier. Weigel responded minutes after a tweet from Trump, who said he had \"put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before I arrived.\" Weigel said he took the tweet down after Daily Mail political editor David Martosko told him he had gotten it wrong.  \"Sure thing: I apologize. I deleted the photo after @dmartosko told me I'd gotten it wrong. Was confused by the image of you walking in the bottom right corner,\" he tweeted. Trump later called on Weigel to be fired, even though it appeared to be an innocent mistake. Weigel still works for The Post.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"9092","repeated_count":"1","date":"10/29/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
