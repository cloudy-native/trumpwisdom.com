It sounds so pretty. It was going to cost us a fortune and it was going to put us at a tremendous disadvantage, and we have cleaner air now than anybody. ... I want crystal-clean water. We could do that. We don’t have to pay trillions of dollars to other places.”","analysis":"Each country set its own commitments under the Paris Accord, so Trump's comment is puzzling. He could unilaterally change the commitments offered by former President Barack Obama, which is technically allowed under the Accord. The United States does not have \"cleaner air now than anybody.\" Several research studies show the United States is not even in the top 20 countries for air quality.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30935, 30612, 30011, 28017, 28226, 27009, 26806, 27465, 26464, 26066, 25892, 24767, 24847, 23994, 23712, 23414, 23462, 23257, 23052, 22364, 20975, 21602, 22546, 21320, 21363, 21824, 22684, 21422, 21465, 21191, 22572, 21074, 17623, 17208, 16189, 16010, 15682, 15358, 14048, 12757, 12306, 11082, 11465, 11798, 10648, 10999, 10246, 9942, 7616, 7567, 6043, 6361, 5779, 5694, 5031, 4614, 4255, 4162, 2363, 1901, 1858, 1090, 0833, 0765, 0731","repeated_count":"65","date":"08/31/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
