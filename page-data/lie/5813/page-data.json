A little shocked took place early in the morning. But the fact is, we didn't get one Democrat vote. We would have saved a trillion dollars -- think of it -- our country would have saved $1 trillion had we gotten that extra vote. We didn't get one vote from one Democrat. But we've pretty much dismantled it.”","analysis":"Trump was not one vote away from repealing and replacing Obamacare. A bare-bones GOP plan called \"skinny repeal\" failed in the Senate by one vote, but that bill did not match what the House had approved. There was no guarantee that the House and Senate would have been able to come up with a compromise measure at conference. Furthemore, while Trump successfully repealed Obamacare's individual mandate, most of the law remains in place. It is not \"pretty much dismantled.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
