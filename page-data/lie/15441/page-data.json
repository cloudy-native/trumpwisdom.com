As of September, there were seven cases, but one -- who says he is innocent and will fight the charges -- was released from custody. Five of the suspects are in the county jail pending trials — four of them held without bond on serious charges that preclude release. The remaining suspect, Nestor Lopez-Guzman, was in the Montgomery Detention Center on Aug. 19 when he gave notice he was about to post a $15,000 bond. ICE officials said they were able to take “custody of Lopez-Guzman pursuant to the detainer.” The next day, Lopez-Guzman posted an immigration bond and was released, pending further court or removal actions. County officials said that shows ICE has to follow the same laws, but there have been some reports the country has rolled back some of its policies.
