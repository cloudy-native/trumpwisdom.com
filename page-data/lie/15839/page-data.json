They could have never done it without me. It was done by us. It wasn't done by anybody else. They came to me. They've been trying to get it for many years. President Obama wouldn't do it or couldn't get it done.”","analysis":"Trump signed the First Step Act in 2018, and it was described as historic criminal justice reform. But in these remarks, Trump oversells his accomplishment and undersells President Barack Obama's role. One of the biggest pieces of the First Step Act -- a provision that reduced sentences for crack cocaine offenses -- was an extension of Obama’s efforts in 2010.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"29832, 29918, 30294, 30527, 29303, 29635, 29532, 29701, 29952, 30006, 30131, 29153, 26950, 26732, 27275, 27547, 26323, 25412, 25319, 25370, 24960, 23676, 23119, 21913, 22373, 22465, 21744, 22138, 20910, 20499, 20433, 20076, 20112, 19982, 20134, 20192, 20196, 19875, 19851, 20316, 18875, 17633, 17549, 17047, 16949, 17025, 17216, 17163, 16888, 18196, 15839, 15749, 15190, 13318, 12474, 12346","repeated_count":"56","date":"12/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
