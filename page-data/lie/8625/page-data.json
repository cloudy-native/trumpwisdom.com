By switching from one to the other, Trump confuses the issue and exaggerates the criminality. In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts. Furthermore, not all charges result in convictions.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"26673, 9553, 9265, 9134, 8783, 8738, 8625, 8490, 7809, 7764","repeated_count":"10","date":"02/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
