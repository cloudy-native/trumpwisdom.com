I've tried to keep the price as low as possible. I got involved personally. I don't even know if I'm supposed to do it. I'll probably get in trouble because I cut the price, you know. But we cut it very substantially. Very, very substantially.”","analysis":"Trump has claimed he was able to get $600 million to $700 million off the cost of F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes in negotiations with Lockheed Martin chief executive Marillyn Hewson in a meeting held on Jan. 13, 2017. But Lockheed already had planned cost reductions. In a Dec. 19, 2016 briefing — before Trump met with Hewson — the head of the Defense Department’s F-35 Joint Program Office, Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, announced costs would come down “significantly\" -- 6 to 7 percent -- in the next lot of 90 planes. This cost reduction, up to $630 million, was already reflected in the Air Force’s budget. The average unit price has been decreasing for years, and Bogdan repeatedly had announced his intention to lower the cost of the jets.
