In other words, she lied. This was the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats plan all along, long before the Ukraine phone call.

But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) rebuffed calls to impeach the president until she announced an inquiry into the Ukraine scandal in September. 2019 An intelligence community whistleblower sparked the inquiry in a complaint filed Aug. 12, which in turn was based on Trump's phone call with the president of Ukraine on July 25. That's a timeline spanning a few months, not two and a half years.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
