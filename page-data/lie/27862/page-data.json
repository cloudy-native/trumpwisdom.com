Now they're all saying Merry Christmas again.”","analysis":"This claim is a strange favorite of the president's. There is no evidence that stores stopped using Merry Christmas in their advertising, were \"ashamed\" to do so or that any of this changed since Trump took office.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30893, 29550, 28895, 28121, 27796, 27862, 27164, 16615, 16418, 16244","repeated_count":"10","date":"10/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
