No obstruction.”","analysis":"Far from totally exonerating Trump, the Mueller report says clearly that it does not exonerate Trump. It casts the president and his campaign in a damning light. Mueller did not bring charges on conspiracy or illegal coordination with Russia, for lack of sufficient evidence. But the special counsel spent half of his 448-page report detailing a sustained effort by Trump to derail his investigation. Mueller used suggestive language to raise the prospect of impeachment proceedings in Congress over the evidence he gathered on obstruction of justice. Although, it should be noted that Mueller declined to reach a decision on obstruction charges (in part because of a Justice Department policy that barred him from indicting the sitting president) and did not make an explicit recommendation on impeachment.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"31003, 30831, 30773, 29795, 29880, 30462, 29206, 28070, 28181, 26949, 27044, 26237, 24571, 23432, 21342, 19846, 19620, 19628, 17297, 16927, 16677, 16464, 16311, 16013, 14770, 14175, 13517, 12950, 13399, 12854, 13678, 12996, 12771, 12650, 11582, 11653, 11654, 11533, 11352, 11556, 12135, 12151, 12070, 12236, 12030, 11979, 11449, 11479, 11834, 11858, 11865, 11162, 11167, 11775, 11818, 11113, 11009, 11730, 11733, 11096, 10814, 10800, 10740, 10788, 10965, 10727, 10662, 10675, 10676, 10714, 10776, 10780, 10439, 10958, 10589, 10593, 10653, 10772, 10414, 10571, 10572, 10937, 10390, 10535, 10543, 10851, 10383, 10357, 10332, 10342, 10346, 10289, 10123, 10125, 10207, 10094, 10157, 9876, 9962, 10115, 10020, 10023, 10072, 10058, 10064, 10065, 10066, 10067, 9747, 9756, 9999, 9903, 9969, 9848, 9933, 9961, 9827, 9741, 9792, 9658, 9495, 9561","repeated_count":"122","date":"04/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
