They're protesting in favor of President Trump, as opposed to against. There's hundreds of trucks out there. And that's the sign of love, not the sign of your typical protests. So I want to thank our great truckers. They like me and I like them. We're working on something together.”","analysis":"This was not a pro-Trump protest. The truckers were complaining about a variety of issues, including freight rates, price-gouging, safety regulations and autonomous vehicles that could threaten their livelihoods. Greg Anderson, one trucker, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/15/politics/fact-check-trump-trucker-protest/index.html\">told CNN</a> that Trump had \"lied on national television\" during a Fox News interview about how the protesters are not protesters at all. \"This is not here to support Trump. We're here to get resolution and bring awareness to our problem and fix our problems,\" he said.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
