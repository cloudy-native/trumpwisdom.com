Did we see Anonymous? Hello staffer, Anonymous turned out to be a guy. I'm trying to figure out. I don't know who the hell this guy is. So The New York Times said, 'A senior White House official.' Nobody knew who he was....Then, somebody gets him at the New York Times, the fake New York Times, and all of a sudden he becomes nasty, and he writes, and they say, 'A top White House official.' Well, he was a staffer, low, had nothing to do with the White House.”","analysis":"When the New York Times published <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html\">the opinion article</a> by \"Anonymous,\" it did not claim he was a White House official. The newspaper, which titled the op-ed \"I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration,\" used the phrasing \"a senior official in the Trump administration.\" Many people at the time speculated the article was written by a Cabinet official. Instead, it turned out that 33-year-old Miles Taylor was only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/us/politics/miles-taylor-anonymous-trump.html\">chief of staff</a> to a cabinet official, the Secretary of Homeland Security. One can certainly question whether the New York Times should have granted its platform to someone at that level. But in any case, the New York Times never said \"Anonymous\" was someone working in the White House at the time.
