Thirty-one phones and they said, oh, we made a mistake and they all made the exact same mistake....They just weren't smart when they all used the same exact method to clean their phone. That wasn't smart you know. At least put it in a little bit different -- 31 different phones. Like what is it, 21 people, 31 phones? But that's OK, that's OK. That's only illegal, that's only illegal.”","analysis":"This is a tempest in a teapot. Justice Department records obtained by Judicial Watch reveal that some of the cell phones used by attorneys and investigators on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team had their cell phones a wiped during the Russia investigation. The erasures of data on the phones were the result of their investigators forgetting passwords, breaking or losing devises and other reasons mobile devices are often reset to factory settings. Trump and his allies tried to make a stink about the revelation but the DOJ Inspector General found that there was no improper conduct by Mueller's team.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25382, 25976, 25096, 24907, 24529, 24541, 24444, 23933, 24022","repeated_count":"9","date":"09/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
