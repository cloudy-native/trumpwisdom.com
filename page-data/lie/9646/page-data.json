For the specific group of migrants Trump was addressing, asylum-seekers, data suggests the return rate is even higher. The data for a program that Trump ended in June shows participants had a 100 percent attendance record at court hearings. They also had a 99 percent rate of check-ins and appointments with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"28994, 27627, 28231, 17410, 11609, 11380, 12175, 11953, 11940, 9646, 9706, 9142, 8750, 6270","repeated_count":"14","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
