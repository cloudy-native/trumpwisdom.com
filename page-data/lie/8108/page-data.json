For African American, the best ever. Hispanic, Asian, the best ever. The best in 50 years. And the overall number, soon that's going to be beaten. So we have the best job numbers. We need people. We need great, qualified people. ”","analysis":"Unemployment for November was 3.7 percent, which was the lowest in nearly 50 years but was not a record low. The lowest monthly unemployment rate recorded since World War II is 2.5 percent in 1953; the lowest annual unemployment rate is 2.9 percent in 1953. The unemployment rate in December rose to 3.9 percent. That resulted in an annual unemployment rate of 3.9 percent for all of 2018 -- a full percentage point higher than 1953. Plus, job numbers were strong in December, but the economy has added more jobs in a month at least five times since 2012.
