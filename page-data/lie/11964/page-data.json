They don't want to take a pay cut. And very importantly, most importantly, they don't want to have crime. … That's why my poll numbers went way up with Hispanics because they really understand the border the best of anybody.”","analysis":"The NBC/Marist poll Trump is referring to, from mid-January, had him at 50 percent approval among Hispanics but was quite outdated by the time he made these remarks. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/29/trump-hispanic-support-poll-2020-1136373\">It was also an outlier at the time</a>. Other polls had Trump garnering much less support from Hispanics. A Washington Post/ABC poll at the time found 18 percent support. A Quinnipiac University poll found 35 percent. Most polls show that a large majority of Hispanics do not approve of Trump.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
