But that's false, according to government experts. The coronavirus that causes covid-19 is so new that scientists don't know with any certainty how long any possible immunity to the coronavirus lasts. “There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again; this is called natural immunity,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html\">said a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage</a> updated on Oct. 14, as Trump was making these claims. “Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID-19 may not last very long, but more studies are needed to better understand this.” (Sometimes, Trump would say he did not know if his immunity would last four months or a lifetime, so we are not including those statements in this database.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"30894, 29434, 29066, 29151, 28538, 28395, 28772, 27876, 27710, 27260, 27279, 25759, 25672, 25710, 25478, 25620","repeated_count":"16","date":"10/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
