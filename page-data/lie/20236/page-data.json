Russia, India and the United Kingdom all had done more than 10 million tests at this point, so the United States was not ahead by 20 million tests. In any case, China announced in June that it had conducted 90 million tests, three times more than the United States. What ultimately matters is testng per million people, and as of early July the United States still lagged major countries such as the U.K., Russia and Spain under this metric.
