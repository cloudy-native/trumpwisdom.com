Right after I got sworn -- took the oath of office, they did that story -- literally, a very few moments after the swearing-in -- that the road to impeachment starts right now. But I had a lot of other things. But I said during the course of the first very early period, like a week -- I said, 'By the way, how many federal judgeships do I have?' They said, 'Sir, you have 142.' I said, 'What?' 'You have 142, sir.' I said, 'You've got to be kidding.142? You mean I have two, one, none?' 'No, you have 142.' And President Obama was not very good at getting it done, because, you know, people held him up and everything else. But, with time, you get them all done. You get them done. But he put a big rush on at the end when he saw we were doing well in the polls, and coming up and up, and it wasn't enough time. So we inherited 142 open federal judgeships, including the court of appeals. First time in history. First time in history anything like that has ever happened. And then they say, 'Oh, he was a great President. Oh, great. He was great.' Great for who? He was great for us. And in that way, he was.”","analysis":"Contrary to his boasts, Trump did not achieve a record for appointing the most appeals court and district court judges. Bill Clinton has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/13/how-trump-compares-with-other-recent-presidents-in-appointing-federal-judges/\">the record</a>, with 367 judicial appointments in his two terms, followed by Ronald Reagan with 358 and then George W. Bush with 322. Through his four years, 226 judges nominated by Trump were confirmed by the Senate. (That is still behind Jimmy Carter, who had 261 judges confirmed in his single term.) George Washington appointed 39 judges during his presidency. Trump appointed 54 judges to the federal appeals court, behind Carter's 59 appeals-court appointments. Trump ranks second, after Carter, in terms of the number of district judges. (He just edged out Clinton and George W. Bush.) Trump often said he would appoint nearly 300 judges but he ended up well short of that number.
