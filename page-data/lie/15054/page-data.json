It'll take probably three weeks, four weeks, or five weeks. As you know, we're going to be in Chile together for a big summit. And maybe it'll be then, or maybe it'll be sometime around then. But we've come to a deal on intellectual property, financial services. A tremendous deal for the farmers. A purchase of -- from 40 to 50 billion dollars' worth of agricultural products. To show you how big that is, that would be two and a half, three times what China had purchased at its highest point thus far. So, they were purchasing $16 or $17 billion at the highest point, and that'll be brought up to $40 billion to $50 billion. … And what they've been doing now, I believe, is about $8 billion, right?”","analysis":"False.
