If you remember, during the debates, we were having, let's say, the opposing party -- to be nice -- say that manufacturing jobs don't happen anymore.  I said, 'Really?  We don't make things anymore?'  Well, we have 400,000, and we'll have 500,000 in a very short period of time.”","analysis":"During the debates, Hillary Clinton spoke about investing in manufacturing jobs; she did not say \"don't happen anymore.\" Moreover, Trump is counting jobs from Election Day, even though he did not take office until almost three months later.  The number of manufacturing jobs created in his presidency is about 380,000.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"4698, 4433","repeated_count":"2","date":"08/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
