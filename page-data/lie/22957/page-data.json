And they admitted they made a mistake and many were sent to dead people, at least two, three, four, were sent to dogs. One was sent to a cat.”","analysis":"The state of Virginia did not mail these ballot applications. They were mailed out by a nonpartisan third-party group, the Center for Voter Information. \"The big problem is that the mailers included pre-paid return envelopes addressed to the incorrect registrar’s office. For instance, Fairfax County voters received return envelopes addressed to the Fairfax City Registrar,\" according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wjla.com/news/local/more-than-500000-virginia-voters-were-mailed-absentee-applications-with-incorrect-info\">ABC 7 WJLA</a>. \"We don't believe this organization was acting maliciously, they just were not very diligent in their follow-through,\" said Gary Scott, General Registrar and Director of Elections for Fairfax County. The group and state officials immediately began working to correct the errors and route the ballot applications to the right office. Ballot applications are sent only to registered voters -- not cats and dogs, as Trump sometimes claims.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"29141, 28569, 27166, 26357, 26296, 25183, 25117, 24723, 24499, 23230, 23282, 23139, 23013, 22957, 22876, 22879","repeated_count":"16","date":"08/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
