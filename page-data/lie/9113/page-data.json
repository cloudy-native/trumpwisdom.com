When I'm with him face to face, nice. When he speaks about me, not so nice. But face to face, he loves me. Called me up he said, ‘You're a great president; you're doing a great job.’ He actually did two weeks ago to me so he'll probably deny it, but check the phone records at the White House. … Three or four weeks. … Let’s say four weeks ago or so. …  ‘I just want to tell you you're a great president. And you're one of the smartest people I've ever met.’ That's what he said. Now that's what he said. Will he admit it? No, I doubt it. But that's what he said.”","analysis":"Trump often makes these evidence-free claims about adversaries praising him in private conversations.
