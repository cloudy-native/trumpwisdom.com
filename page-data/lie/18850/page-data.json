I put the ban in place regardless of your wishes. Your political gamesmanship on this issue was deadly, as other governments, relying on your comments, delayed imposing life-saving restrictions on travel to and from China.”","analysis":"Trump’s so-called ban did not block all travel from China but only non-U.S. citizens, with 11 exemptions. The New York Times calculated that nearly 40,000 people traveled from China to the United States two months after Trump imposed restrictions. Moreover, screening proceedings of travelers from China were uneven and inconsistent, the Times said.The WHO has cautioned against such travel restrictions, saying they are ineffective against a virus and in the long run counterproductive. Trump, according to news reports, was initially skeptical and worried about provoking China after signing a major trade deal. But his national security and public health experts convinced him that the move would buy time to put in place effective prevention and testing measures. (Then the administration failed to ramp up testing for weeks.) As for Trump’s claim that the WHO’s skepticism about travel restriction preventing other countries from taking action, we have previously calculated that 38 countries imposed similar or tougher restrictions on travel from China before or at the same time the U.S. restrictions were put in place.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
