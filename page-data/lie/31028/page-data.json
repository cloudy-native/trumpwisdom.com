But state officials have explained he’s comparing incorrect data.\n\n“One of the numbers you're seeing out there is that a 3 percent rejection rate versus this 0.5 percent rejection rate, but they're comparing it to apples to oranges,” Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/georgia-press-conference-on-election-count-updates-transcript-november-17\">said at Nov. 17 news conference</a>. “That is including [all rejected] ballots. The biggest chunk of ballots are rejected or counted as rejected showed up after the 7 p.m. deadline. That is where the majority of rejections come from. But for signature matches always run around 0.15 to 0.2 percent.
