You know, we're getting a lot of heat because, I was saying, there were some bad people in that caravan. Right? So we checked, 300 people.”","analysis":"Any crowd of 7,000 people is going to have some bad apples. Mexican officials have already identified several and deported them, so they are no longer a potential threat. Trump's figure of 300 people is based on a fuzzy news release to justify presidential assertions, and officials refused to explain how the numbers were calculated. Still, numbers issued by DHS — 270 to 470 — are roughly consistent with the percentage of people with criminal pasts — 5 percent — in the 2014 surge. So it may not be completely out of line even if the possible criminality is hyped. \n\n","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
