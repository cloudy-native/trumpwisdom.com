I said, 'Mike, we're giving them money, and, you know, you're always torn about that because we have our country to build, we have our cities to build and our roads to fix. But we're giving them money. Tell me, why isn't Germany paying money? Why isn't France? Why isn't United Kingdom paying money? Why aren't they paying money? Why are we paying them money? Is that a correct statement, Mike? I say, 'Find out what the hell is going on.' And I told that to all of my people, OMB. I said -- I asked that question: 'How much is Germany paying?

Europe has been a major funder to Ukraine since Russia annexed its Crimean Peninsula in 2014, often providing more aid than the United States. The European Union has provided more than 15 billion euros ($16.5 billion) in grants and loans to Ukraine, according to an E.U. fact sheet on relations with Ukraine. Meanwhile, NATO has its own military cooperation program with Ukraine, establishing six trust funds to assist the country in improving its military readiness. The United States provided $1.3 billion to Ukraine since late 2013, according to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"16922, 16768, 16790, 16589, 16037, 15942, 16233, 14760, 14799, 14801, 13814, 14847, 14328, 15730, 15262, 14250, 12960, 12894, 13176, 13181, 13371, 12832, 12848, 12971","repeated_count":"24","date":"02/06/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
