They wanted him to lie about me, make up a story, and with few exceptions nobody did that. … This was all Obama, this was all Biden. These people were corrupt, the whole thing was corrupt, and we caught them. We caught them.”","analysis":"All the evidence shows that Flynn lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. He pleaded guilty before two different judges before seeking to recant his plea. Documents made public later on in his legal proceedings show that the FBI was closing a counterintelligence investigation into Flynn at the time of his interview in the White House on Jan. 24, 2017. But that doesn't change the fact that Flynn gave false answers to the FBI about his conversations with the ambassador, Sergei Kislyak, or the fact that Flynn pleaded guilty to false statements in 2017.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
