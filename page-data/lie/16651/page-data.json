And you know another big thing? They have the right to do ballistic missiles. We couldn't go into areas and, look, we'd have to give massive notices. So if they were doing something, they could clean them up. It was ridiculous. But most importantly, it expires. This is a short-term agreement. And now, once it expired, they have an absolute, clear, unstopped path to have nuclear weapons, unstopped.”","analysis":"The International Atomic Energy Agency said the Iran deal resulted in the \"world's most robust\" nuclear inspection effort. Iran used to bar inspectors from certain Western countries and would occasionally deny visas to IAEA personnel investigating the possible military dimensions of its nuclear program. Now as the deal was implemented, Iran issued long-term, multiple-entry visas to inspectors. The IAEA can request access to any Iranian facility if it has evidence of nuclear activities occurring there, but inspectors have not used that authority to attempt to investigate military areas since the deal was implemented -- which some experts said indicated that the agency was too cautious.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
