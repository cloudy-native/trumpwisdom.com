They’ll go through court for years. And, at the end, they’ll be — who knows what happens. We need quick justice and we need strong justice —  much quicker and much stronger than we have right now. Because what we have right now is a joke and it’s a laughingstock.

The longest case took 35 months. One case — the failed Times Square bomber — was completed in just seven weeks. The average duration between indictment and conviction of the 23 cases is 16.2 months.\nMany militants ended up pleading guilty, which attests to the strength of the government’s case.
