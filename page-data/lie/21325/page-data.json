Seattle. And the mayor said, 'It's going to be a Summer of Love.' And I said, 'She's just kidding, right? Isn't she?' She wasn't kidding. But we were all set to send in the troops, send in the people that we were going to send in. And what happened is amazing. We told them, and all of a sudden, the police went out and they cleaned it up. But that place would still be occupied if we didn't get involved.”","analysis":"Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan flatly denied to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/07/10/trump-told-hannity-story-about-threatening-seattle-mayor-says-it-never-happened/\">The Washington Post PlumLine</a> that any conversation like this with Trump — or anyone around him — ever took place. “He never contacted me or my office to warn us,” Durkan said, adding that no one from the White House and no one connected to Trump had told them any such thing. “We had no conversations whatsoever with the White House about anything related to the protests, Capitol Hill, or anything along these lines,” Durkan told us, though conversations related to coronavirus had taken place at various junctures. “It just never happened,” Durkan said. “I don't know what world he’s living in.” The mayor had signed an executive order on June 30th to formally close the area and on July 1 police moved in to clear it.
