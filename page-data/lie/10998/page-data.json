The President is a friend of mine. Sometimes I'll call him up, \"How's it doing over there? How you doing in Paris?\" \"Not so good. Not so good.\" The yellow vests. And you know that was all about the accord, because they were charging people tremendous amount of money and sending that money all over the world to countries that they never heard of, and the people got tired of it.”","analysis":"President Trump gets this half right. The Yellow Vest protests are the result of a tax hike, but protesters are upset about the hike — not what the government is planning to do with the money. They began as a protest over the hike in fuel prices, but have spread to focus on general economic inequality. Protesters are now advocating for a higher minimum wage.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/14/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
