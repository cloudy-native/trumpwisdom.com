In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone — and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society.”","analysis":"In 2016, there was an uptick in the homicide rate in the 30 largest cities. One outlier city -- Chicago -- was responsible for 43.7 percent of the total increase in homicide rates in 2016. Seven people were shot and killed in Chicago on Feb. 22, the deadliest day in the city so far this year. Overall, violent crime is on a decades-long decline, since the height of the crack cocaine epidemic in the early 1990s.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"0160, 0149, 0118, 0101","repeated_count":"4","date":"02/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
