And, sir, we could redo it I think for $200,000.' And it's the first time in my life I've ever said this: I said, 'David, that's too cheap. It doesn't even sound good. You got to go more.' Usually, I'm trying to cut price. But for 200,000, I said, 'What the hell kind of a -- David, make it like 500,000.'”","analysis":"The new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem for about $400,000. (Trump sometimes claims it cost $500,000.) U.S. government documents <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/67072609\">show</a> the overall cost for the conversion now totals more than $23 million.
