But seriously, look, look, look, they won't say it. They won't say it because when we have protesters all in favor, they don't talk about it, but there’s a slob, there’s a real slob, wait, wait a minute. She'll get hell when she gets back home with mom. But she made — look. She screams a little bit and you know what I like to avoid them. ... Okay, so there’s one disgusting person who made — wait, wait — who made it — I wouldn't say this, but made a horrible gesture with the wrong finger, right? Now, they won't say that, the fake news. They won't say. If one of us did that, it would be like the biggest story ever. I think it’s terrible. And I'll tell you the other thing. I don't know who the security company is, but the police came up, but they want to be so politically correct, so they don't grab a likely risk and get her out. They say, ‘Oh, would you please come?’ ‘If you'd please come with me.’ 'Sir, ma’am, would you — ' And then she gives the guy the finger and you — oh, oh. You got to get a little bit stronger than that, folks. Now, I hate to say it. I hate to say it but, of course, the guy’s afraid that, you know, he'll grab a wrist slightly and he'll be sued for the rest of his life, that you've destroyed her life. No, but I think it’s a terrible thing. And here’s what happened. So these fakers back there, they're the most dishonest people in the world. They'll go back: ‘This is one person who made a horrible gesture,’ only because the security band let her have so much time, and usually, I have to say, the police do an incredible job.”","analysis":"Trump went on a strange tangent in response to a protester at his rally. He falsely claimed news reports whitewash the fact that some Trump protesters use vulgarities. Then, he claimed that police and security at his rallies avoid physically removing protesters for fear of getting sued. Then, he theorized that this reticence to quickly eject protesters gives them more of the spotlight and wider news coverage.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
