We started with nothing. There's never been a person in our country -- even though we had just absolutely no -- we were -- we were going on empty -- never been one person that needed a ventilator that didn't get it. Think of that.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to the Strategic National Stockpile, a repository of emergency medicines and supplies created in 1999 in case of enemy attacks. In 2003, the stockpile’s mission was expanded to prepare for a possible pandemic. On its face, calling the cupboard \"bare\" or \"empty\" might seem like a strange assertion because Trump has been president for three years, so he bears some responsibility for what was in the stockpile and whether it was appropriate for a pandemic. Indeed, The Washington Post <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/before-pandemic-trumps-stockpile-chief-put-focus-on-biodefense-an-old-client-benefited/2020/05/04/d3c2b010-84dd-11ea-878a-86477a724bdb_story.html\">reported</a> that a key administration official overseeing the stockpile sought to “bolster the nation’s stockpile of defenses against biological and chemical weapons, a focus he made a priority over preparing for a natural pandemic.” A senior administration official suggested that Trump was specifically talking about the stockpile’s inventory of N95 masks — fitted face masks that block most airborne particles. But the shelf life of N95 masks is generally five years, so in theory, any masks purchased in 2009 would have needed to be replaced.
