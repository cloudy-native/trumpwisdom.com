I signed a very good executive order yesterday, but that's only limited -- no matter how you cut it, it leads to separation ultimately. I'm directing HHS, DHS, and DOJ to work together to keep illegal immigrant families together during the immigration process and to reunite these previously separated groups.”","analysis":"In fact, families are being separated because of a \"zero tolerance\" policy from the Trump administration dating to April 2018. No law, whether passed by Democrats or otherwise, requires these separations. Trump signed an executive order to end family separations shortly after saying it couldn't be done through an executive order.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"7743, 3555, 3849, 3852, 3489, 3506, 3521, 3838, 3377, 3422, 3492, 3916, 3935, 3338","repeated_count":"14","date":"06/21/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
