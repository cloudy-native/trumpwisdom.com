One of the numbers you're seeing out there is that a 3 percent rejection rate versus this 0.5 percent rejection rate, but they're comparing it to apples to oranges,” Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/georgia-press-conference-on-election-count-updates-transcript-november-17\">said at Nov. 17 news conference</a>. “That is including [all rejected] ballots. The biggest chunk of ballots are rejected or counted as rejected showed up after the 7 p.m. deadline. That is where the majority of rejections come from. But for signature matches always run around 0.15 to 0.2 percent. That is the normal thing we've seen in Georgia for years.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
