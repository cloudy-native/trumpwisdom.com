The New York Times said her religion is not consistent with American values. She's Catholic. That covers a lot of people. That's a very disgraceful thing to say.”","analysis":"New York Times opinion columnist Elizabeth Bruenig <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/26/opinion/sunday/amy-coney-barrett-catholic-supreme-court.html\">wrote</a>, “Rather than regenerating a long-vanquished prejudice, Judge Barrett’s nomination has merely renewed attention to a fundamental conflict, centuries underway, between Catholicism and the American ethos.” Her point was not as simplistic as Trump suggests, nor is it a critique on Barrett’s religion. Bruenig simply observes a tightrope: “Roman Catholicism does not readily distinguish between public and private moral obligations. In the thought of John Locke, one of liberalism’s earliest architects, willingness to make that distinction was critical to participation in a tolerant society.“ (The philosophy of liberalism forms much of the base of American ideas.) This dichotomy is one that every Catholic has to navigate, according to Bruenig, who concludes, “[Barrett] neither created this situation nor will she end it; no justice placed on the bench could. It has a life and a legacy bigger than any individual cast in it by history, and it seems poised to keep us in shocking, surprising times.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
