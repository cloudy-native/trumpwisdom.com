I said Melania, first lady, I said first lady, oh, I'm going to watch television tonight. I'm going to come home early. Because let me tell you, 6:30 is very early. I stay in there late, but I'm going to come home early. I'm going to show you what a great job. I just got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and we're going to sit there and I'm going to just going to soak it in, darling....So we turn it on and they did a story on the weather. It was raining heavily in a certain area and they did a story on something else, something else, and something else. Then, they went into another story, then another and then a commercial that lasted for about nine minutes...So it came toward the end, I said, darling, I'm a little embarrassed, but the following day I got nominated for another one...They had another story that this time -- that cleaning up the ranch -- another one, another one, another one, got to the commercial, never ended, got back a little tiny piece and I said they didn't cover two Nobel Prizes. I got two in one week, did you ever hear that one? For different things, totally unrelated...And somebody had a show, where they said the amount of time devoted to Donald Trump's Nobel Peace Prize, two of them, zero on the network, zero.”","analysis":"Nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize is not as “big” of a deal (or as pristine) as the president suggests. Indeed, there are 318 candidates for the 2020 prize. Moreover, it does not somehow guarantee a fond place in history. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trumps-nobel-nonsense/\">put it clearly</a>: “Indeed, some of history’s most vilified figures have been nominated for the prize. Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin was nominated twice: in 1945 for his effort to end World War II and again in 1948 by a professor from the Czech Republic. And fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was nominated in 1935 by two law professors, one from Germany and the other from France. (Adolf Hitler was nominated in 1939 — the nomination was later withdrawn — by “an anti-fascist member of the Swedish parliament who never intended his submission to be taken seriously,” according to Nobel archives.)” Sometimes, Trump will falsely say the news media avidly covered Barack Obama's nomination but not his; in fact, it had not been reported that Obama had been nominated, which is why Obama winning the honor was such a surprise -- and covered extensively in the media.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"30271, 29719, 28578, 28256, 27961, 26678, 26474, 26126, 25704, 25578, 25327, 25352, 25220, 25263, 26579, 25902, 25125, 25059, 24863, 24690, 24612, 24391, 24176, 24101, 23935, 23936, 23785, 23856","repeated_count":"28","date":"09/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
