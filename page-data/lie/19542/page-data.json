He left out that DHS said the study was preliminary. Because it wasn't published, the study's findings and methodology cannot be scrutinized by independent experts. “There is some evidence to suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may transmit less efficiently in environments with higher ambient temperature and humidity,” a report published in April by the National Academy of Sciences stated. “However, given the lack of host immunity globally, this reduction in transmission efficiency may not lead to a significant reduction in disease spread without the concomitant adoption of major public health interventions.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
