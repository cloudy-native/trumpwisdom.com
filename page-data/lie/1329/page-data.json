I think that is Watergate modern age.”","analysis":"Trump suggests the State Department under Hillary Clinton had sole approval authority on a uranium rights deal with a company largely owned by Russia’s nuclear energy agency. But the State Department is one of nine agencies in the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States to vet and sign off on all U.S. transactions involving foreign governments. There is no evidence Clinton herself got involved in the deal personally, and it is highly questionable that this deal even rose to the level of the secretary of state. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission also needed to approve, and did approve, the transfer.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"14920, 4091, 1558, 1329, 1031, 0923, 0857, 0952, 0502, 0332, 0323, 0098","repeated_count":"12","date":"10/25/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
