It's 2.5 per cent, but basically, when you do certain paperwork and check the wrong boxes you pay nothing. It's stupid. When we buy a car from them, and we buy a lot of them, believe it or not, it's a 40 percent tax. So they get 40 percent, we get nothing, other than that it's been a very good deal.”","analysis":"Trump says the United States does not collect this tax but trade experts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2018/10/factchecking-trump-on-trade/\">say</a> the United States does collect the 2.5 percent tax on the relatively few cars imported from China; it's a tax collected on all car imports. (Trump failed to mention one significant caveat: that the U.S. has long charged a 25 percent tax on imports of pickup trucks.) Moreover, China had reduced the tax on imported cars from 25 percent to 15 percent. But in response to Trump's tariffs of 25 percent on Chinese cars and other products, China slapped an additional 25 percent tariff on U.S. autos, resulting in the 40 percent tax that Trump is complaining about.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
