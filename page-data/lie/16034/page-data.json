We get along. He’s representing his country. I'm representing my country. We have to do what we have to do. But he did sign a contract. He did sign an agreement, talking about denuclearization. And that was signed. Number-one sentence: denuclearization.”","analysis":"The document signed in June 2018 by Trump and Kim Jong Un was not a contract. It was remarkably vague, leaving it open to interpretation and debate, compared to previous documents signed by North Korea. The statement said North Korea committed to “work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The phrase is not defined and “toward” is rather weak. In the past, North Korea viewed “denuclearization” to mean the United States removing the nuclear umbrella it provides to Japan and South Korea; there is no indication its definition has changed.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
