DRAIN THE SWAMP!”","analysis":"Trump seized on an inaccurate report on a conservative website to falsely claim the rules were suddenly changed to allow for the whistleblower report on his Ukraine phone call. The original report was that the form had changed in August. The Inspector General’s process for handling whistleblower allegations is determined not by a form but by the law and related policy documents. The key document, ICD 120, has been virtually unchanged since 2014. Contrary to the speculation, the whistleblower used the 2018 form, not the new online form. The IG then investigated and found that his allegations were credible and that Congress should be notified. in an unusual statement, the IG rebutted Trump's claim and the flawed reporting that sparked it.
