In other words, we'll be taking something away from the federal government and getting it back to the states, who can better provide and who know better what to do.”","analysis":"This is misleading. The Senate GOP health plan changes Medicaid financing by offering states a per-capita cap or a block grant. The per-capita cap does not add flexibility for states, and this would place pressure on some states to make changes to their Medicaid programs that they otherwise would not have made. The block grant option would give states flexibility, but it would not fluctuate automatically based on the number of people enrolled in Medicaid -- which is a restriction.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/14/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
