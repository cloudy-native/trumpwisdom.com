It's a horror show, because when countries put people into the lottery, they're not putting you in; they're putting some very bad people in the lottery. It's common sense. If I ran a country, and if I have a lottery system of people going to the United States, I'm not going to put in my stars; I'm going to put in people I don't want.”","analysis":"Trump grossly misrepresents the diversity visa program, saying other countries deliberately choose bad people to apply. Individuals apply for the visa system, and must have at least a high school diploma or work in specific industries to be eligible for the program. As the term \"lottery\"  implies, applicants are selected via a randomized computer drawing. The selected applicants undergo a background check before entering the country, and some applicants undergo an additional in-depth review if they are considered a security risk.
