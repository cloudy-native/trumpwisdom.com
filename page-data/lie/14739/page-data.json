Ambassador Sondland asks U.S. President (me): 'What do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas & theories. What do you want? It was a very abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood. He (the President) just said,' 'I WANT NOTHING! I WANT NOTHING! I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO! TELL PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING!' Later, Ambassador Sondland said that I told him, 'Good, go tell the truth!' This Witch Hunt must end NOW. So bad for our Country!”","analysis":"Trump has misleadingly seized on a small part of the damaging impeachment inquiry testimony of Gordon Sondland, a Trump donor and U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Sondland testified that White House declined to invite Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to meet with Trump in Washington in order to pressure the Ukrainian president to announce the investigations Trump wanted into Joe Biden. “I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo’?” Sondland said. “With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.” Sondland said he later came to believe that $400 million in military aid to Ukraine was also contingent in announcement of the investigations. But Trump is quoting from a phone conversation that Sondland said he had with Trump on Sept. 9, after Congress announced an investigation into the hold-up of aid to Ukraine. Sondland testified that he did not know if Trump was telling the truth, at least about the funding portion of the quid pro quo.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"15988, 15952, 14597, 14926, 14746, 15771, 14710, 14736, 14739, 14504, 15293, 15159","repeated_count":"12","date":"11/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
