They love him like he is the second coming of God ... But American Jews don’t know him or like him. They don't even know what they're doing or saying anymore. It makes no sense! But that’s OK, if he keeps doing what he’s doing, he’s good for... all Jews, Blacks, Gays, everyone. And importantly, he’s good for everyone in America who wants a job.’ Wow!”","analysis":"Trump is not the second coming of God.
