When Trump doesn't like what's being reported, he calls it fake news. But in almost every case, the reports are proven to be accurate and the substance of Trump's complaint is that the facts reflect poorly on him.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
