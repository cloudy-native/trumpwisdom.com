It’s like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to ..just the large States - the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States & the entire Midwest would end up losing all power - & we can't let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote, but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A.”","analysis":"This is a rare instance in which Trump acknowledges he changed his mind about an issue. But his logic here is faulty, as our colleague Philip Bump <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/03/20/trumps-defensive-defense-electoral-college-doesnt-make-much-sense/?utm_term=.414b86ade694\">explained</a>. Trump claims that the “brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win.” Not really. According to data on nearly 400 candidate trips from July 1, 2016 until Election Day compiled by the National Journal, he himself visited 16 states more than once. He made no visits to 29 states. In the National Journal’s data, which didn’t capture every trip, twenty states got no visits from any of the major-party presidential or vice-presidential candidates. Trump’s argument that “the Cities would end up running the Country” is belated, as well. More than three-quarters of Americans already live in urban areas, most of them in cities. It has been nearly a century since less than half the country did. As for the idea that “Smaller States & the entire Midwest would end up losing all power,” Trump is forgetting two things. First, that smaller states would retain the disproportionate power allocated to them in the Senate, a not-insignificant bulwark. Second, that Midwestern states also have some big cities that would be appealing to candidates: Chicago, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Des Moines.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
