The Supreme Court overturned Andersen's conviction 9-0 because the trial judge failed to give the jury proper instructions. It's absurd to claim Weissman \"destroyed people's lives, took down great companies.\" Enron is the poster child for fraudulent accounting practices in corporate America.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"29797, 30459, 28072, 25594, 24537, 23434, 20513, 17112, 17187, 16091, 16463, 16006, 15481, 14358, 14415, 13759, 13842, 13611, 12957, 13677, 12149, 12039, 12029, 11944, 11863, 11169, 11189, 11774, 11116, 11095, 10915, 10746, 10728, 10717, 10437, 10958, 10960, 10537, 10541, 10542, 10932, 10129, 10283, 9953, 10146, 10149, 10114, 9764, 10021, 10073, 9917, 9824, 9738, 9740, 9346, 9085, 8702, 8050, 7582, 7583, 7584, 7269, 7266, 6580, 6535, 7516, 7211, 7213, 6999, 7452, 5056, 5057, 5040, 5969, 4818, 4756, 4497, 4357, 4406, 4479, 4383, 4469, 4274, 4532, 3611, 3628, 3647, 3388, 3421, 3920, 3930, 3289, 3291, 3241, 3242, 3180, 3248, 3062, 3041, 2944, 2614, 0723","repeated_count":"102","date":"12/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
