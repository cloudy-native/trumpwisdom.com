I mean, look at the leaking and look at the lying. Comey admitted he leaked. Think of it, the top of the FBI, he leaked.”","analysis":"Trump often accuses former FBI Director James Comey of leaking classified information. Comey took contemporaneous notes following each of his meetings with Trump as president and president-elect, which he shared with the senior leadership of the FBI. Comey intentionally wrote these in a way that the information wouldn't be classified. Trump himself revealed these conversations existed in his letter firing Comey. Despite the president's dislike for leaking, the vast majority of leaks are legal and recognized as fully protected speech by the Supreme Court. The Special Counsel's report found Comey's account to be credible: \"With respect to the substance of the dinner conversation, Corney documented the President's request for loyalty in a memorandum he began drafting the night of the dinner; senior FBI officials recall that Corney told them about the loyalty request shortly after the dinner occurred; and Corney described the request while under oath in congressional proceedings and in a subsequent interview with investigators subject to penalties for lying. Corney's memory of the details of the dinner, including that the President requested loyalty, has remained consistent throughout.\"","pinocchios":"4","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"30765, 29239, 26242, 26598, 26599, 26608, 23343, 22328, 21052, 21340, 20879, 20861, 20809, 16075, 12638, 11675, 11182, 9579, 9444, 8017, 8132, 7274, 7582, 7585, 7590, 6075, 4610, 4454, 4356, 4405, 2988, 2927, 2677, 2679, 2681, 2083, 1585","repeated_count":"37","date":"06/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
