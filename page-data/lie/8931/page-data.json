The hostile Cohen testimony, given by a liar to reduce his prison time, proved no Collusion! His just written book manuscript showed what he said was a total lie, but Fake Media won't show it. I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted & corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal & should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election!”","analysis":"Cohen never wrote a manuscript, according to his spokesman. In early 2018, Cohen shopped a book proposal that was pitched as a positive account of Trump, but he apparently did not write anything. Meanwhile, the investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia began months before Trump's victory. The special counsel has revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. Overwhelming evidence shows that Russia orchestrated a campaign of cyber espionage and propaganda to interfere in the U.S. presidential election in 2016. The U.S. intelligence community, the Department of Justice, and the House and Senate intelligence committees have all arrived at this conclusion. Moreover, the evidence shows Russian Vladimir Putin president personally directed the campaign aimed at bolstering Trump. The appointment of the special counsel, made by a man appointed by Trump, stemmed from Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey.
