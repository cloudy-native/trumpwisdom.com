We will never dig coal again.' And then four weeks later, she ended up in West Virginia. That did not work out well for her. That was not good. Remember she was trying to explain that she was just kidding.”","analysis":"Trump takes a Hillary Clinton statement out of context. During a March 2016 town hall, Clinton was asked by a voter: “Make the case to poor whites who live in Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, who vote Republican, why they should vote for you based upon economic policies versus voting for a Republican?” Clinton gave a lengthy response, which included the line, “We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.” It was part of her longer answer about how transitioning away from coal-powered plants has already affected mining communities, and her plan to help coal mine workers adjust after losing factory jobs, as explained in her November 2015 policy proposal for revitalizing coal communities. She was noting what she considered economic reality and how to deal with it. She did not say later she was kidding.
