When asked about his sourcing, the president responded it was “according to whoever does that kind of thing.” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hrblock.com/tax-center/newsroom/irs/tax-law-and-policy/tcja-impact\">H&R Block</a> data showed that taxes in Minnesota decreased by 23.4% in 2018.  More likely, Trump obtained this figure from the left-leaning Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, which issued a report saying \"we find that in 2019 more than half will flow to the richest 5 percent of taxpayers, and more than a quarter will flow to the richest one percent of taxpayers. In 2019, the average impact for the middle-fifth of taxpayers will be a tax cut of $800.\" In the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://itep.org/wp-content/uploads/Trump-GOP-Final-Bill-Report.pdf#page=15\">specific case of Minnesota</a>, the report calculated tax savings of $5.2 billion in 2019, with $1.1 billion going to the top one percent and $1.4 billion going to the next four percent.
