The phony Mueller report.”","analysis":"Trump has a habit of calling investigations into his behavior ‘phony’ or ‘fake’ but that does not mean that they are. There is no reason to believe there is anything false about the Mueller report. In fact, the president, on other occasions, has held up as evidence that he did nothing wrong. (The report, released April 2019,  however, stated: ‘If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment.’)","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
