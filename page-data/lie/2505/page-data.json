Sometimes they want to go out and do something else.  But they all want to be in the White House.  So many people want to come in.  I have a choice of anybody.  I could take any position in the White House, and I’ll have a choice of the 10 top people having to do with that position.

According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/\">a Brookings analysis</a>, more than a third of White House staff left or changed positions during the administration's first year. Ronald Reagan, who previously had the highest rate of turnover, saw half of the turnover that the Trump administration has seen. The president regularly contradicts staff and changes his positions. The White House is reportedly struggling to fill vacant positions.
