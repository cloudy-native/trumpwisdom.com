The other 90 percent is a two-meter (six-foot) high electronic fence. As for 99.9 percent, that would not apply to the barrier along the West Bank. The New York Times in 2016 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/world/middleeast/west-bank-israel-palestinians-smugglers.html?_r=0\">reported</a> on a vast smuggling industry that easily evades the Israeli security fence and wall that divides Israeli and Palestinian areas. Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu has pointed to “99 percent” success in reducing immigration from Africa with a barrier erected along the southern border with Egypt. “While there is a clear correlation between the construction of the wall and the decrease in immigration, experts claim that the border wall has only partially contributed to the decrease, and that other measures enacted by the Israeli government have also been of immense importance,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://hir.harvard.edu/article/?a=14542\">a report in Harvard International said</a>. “Israel has also made it less desirable for immigrants that make it across the wall to stay and work.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8825, 8442, 8480, 8106, 8222, 7886, 7737, 7707, 7667, 7650, 5469, 2104, 1763, 0910","repeated_count":"14","date":"12/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
