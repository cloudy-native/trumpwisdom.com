The poll, which does not meet Washington Post standards, found that 83 percent of Hispanics say that immigration priority should be based on a person’s ability to contribute to America, as opposed to based on having relatives in the U.S. The question itself is misleading, as it’s asking “priority,” and it seems natural to answer that yes, you’d want immigrants who can contribute to society.
