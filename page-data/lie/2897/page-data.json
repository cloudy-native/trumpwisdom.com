There is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/10/scott-pruitt-epa-death-threats-review\">scant evidence</a> for now that Pruitt has received credible death threats. At $50 a night, Pruitt paid well below the market value for a condominium in the District. His landlady was the wife of an oil and gas industry lobbyist who had business before the EPA. A day before Trump's tweet, the U.S. Office of Government Ethics sent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4433878-Letter-to-EPA-DAEO.html\">a letter</a> to the EPA questioning whether Pruitt paid market value.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
