If you look at Devin Nunes and the House Intelligence Commission -- Committee -- they said there's no collusion. And guess what? There is none.”","analysis":"On Feb. 12, Burr told reporters: “I'm not sure how to put it any clearer than I said it before. We have no factual evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.” Then, asked whether his committee’s investigation exonerated Trump, Burr said: “Just saying what factually we’ve found to date. We haven't finished our investigation.” A representative for Burr said the committee has not yet issued a final report. These are strong statements from Burr, although he hedges by noting that the investigation is not complete.
