He ran H1N1, remember? He can't remember that. He always goes, 'No, N1H1, isn't it?' No, no. H comes before N, Joe. Just remember it that way. H1N1 swine flu. Remember he said, 'Uh, the, what was that called?'...He ran the swine flu operation. He was the laughing stock of Washington.”","analysis":"Biden did not run the Obama administration's widely-praised swine flu response. While Biden did -- once - mistakenly refer to the swine flu virus as “N1H1″ during a debate in March, 2020, the order of the two halves of the term used to describe the virus — referring to subtypes of two proteins on its surface: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) — is unimportant.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
