How about the lottery system? How about lotteries? This was Chuck Schumer: you put the name in a basket. The country puts the name in the basket. And you pick people out of the lottery. 'Well, let's see, this one's a murderer. This one robbed four banks, this one ... I'd better, not say ... this one, another murderer, ladies and gentlemen, another murderer.”","analysis":"Trump grossly misrepresents the diversity visa program, saying other countries deliberately choose bad people to apply. Individuals apply for the visa system, and must have at least a high school diploma or work in specific industries to be eligible for the program. As the term \"lottery\"  implies, applicants are selected via a randomized computer drawing. The selected applicants undergo a background check before entering the country, and some applicants undergo an additional in-depth review if they are considered a security risk.
