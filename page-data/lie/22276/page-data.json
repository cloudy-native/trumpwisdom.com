That was done by Judicial Watch -- Tom Fitton and Judicial Watch.”","analysis":"Once again, the president is grasping at straws to make bogus claims about alleged voter fraud. Judicial Watch, a conservative group, in 2017 sued the state and Los Angeles County to meet requirements under the National Voter Registration Act to clean up its voter registration files. The group said that the state had not done so for at least two decades and that there were more than 1.5 million registrations on the county’s file of inactive registered voters. In other words, the case had nothing to do with people who had voted — but people who had not voted. The text of settlement did not say there was fraudulent voting or any type voter fraud. There was also no admission of wrongdoing. It simply set up a process for notices to be sent to people found to be inactive.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"22276, 22306, 20410, 19697, 19443, 12465, 12379, 17830","repeated_count":"8","date":"08/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
