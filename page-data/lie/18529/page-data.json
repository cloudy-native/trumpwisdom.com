So we sent thousands of ventilators to New York, and they didn't know about it at the time. They were complaining. Thousands. We had 2,000, and then 2,000, and then 4,000, and they were going there in large numbers. And then before that, we sent many thousands. … What we don't want is where we distribute the ventilators, like we did in New York and they didn't need them, or they didn't know, or they didn't use them.”","analysis":"This makes no sense. New York had not reached the projected apex of covid-19 cases when Trump made these remarks. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state would need 30,000 ventilators at the peak. The state would not be returning 2,000 or 4,000 before the number of patients reached a critical stage.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
