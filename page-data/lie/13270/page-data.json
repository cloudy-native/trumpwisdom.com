We gave them $150 billion. We gave them $1.8 billion, and we got nothing. We got nothing. And, by the way, that agreement was so short term that it expires in a very short period of time. With a country, you don't make a deal that short. Countries last for long times, and you don't do short-term deals, especially when you're paying that kind of money. So I have -- I have good feelings about Iran.”","analysis":"This is Trump's usual medley of false and misleading claims about the Iran nuclear deal. The JCPOA's prohibition on Iran obtaining nuclear weapons does not expire. Trump often makes it sound like the United States cut a check to Iran. He also always uses too high an estimate, $150 billion, for the assets involved. But this was always Iran’s money. Iran had billions of dollars that were frozen in foreign banks around the globe because of international sanctions over its nuclear program.The Treasury Department estimated that once Iran fulfilled other obligations, it would have about $55 billion left. The Central Bank of Iran said the number was actually $32 billion.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
