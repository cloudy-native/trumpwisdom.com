Before Trump’s election, Beijing had committed to slower, more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption, stronger service industries, and moving up the manufacturing value chain from assembly work to high tech. A reduction in the manufacturing labor force (let’s say it is 3 million jobs) must therefore be measured against job growth in China’s tech and service sectors.” Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Trump’s claim of millions of Chinese job losses is “delusional.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"14099, 13574, 13555, 13500, 13349, 12745, 12677, 12722, 13141, 12620, 13252, 13267, 12515, 12451","repeated_count":"14","date":"08/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
