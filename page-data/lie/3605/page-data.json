But there’s nothing showing that “thousands and thousands” of the gang’s members have been deported or imprisoned since the president took office. Instead, it's in the \"hundreds and hundreds\" ballpark. Also, it's a huge exaggeration to say American towns are being \"liberated\" from MS-13, as Trump often claims.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"7473, 6702, 7121, 6909, 6768, 7042, 6292, 5987, 6390, 6491, 5898, 5424, 5425, 5355, 6056, 4149, 3605, 4056, 3998, 4015, 3508, 3529, 3919, 3268, 3193, 3236, 3120, 3107, 2653, 2410, 2434, 2439, 2413, 2337, 7224","repeated_count":"35","date":"06/30/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
