They send in millions of cars at a very low tax. They don't take our cars. And if they do, they have a massive tax on their cars.”","analysis":"Japan was the fourth largest goods export market for the United States in 2017, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. International trade works in such a way that some countries dominate some markets and don't compete as much in others. In this case, Japan has a competitive auto industry, but U.S. companies dominate other industries and export heavily to Japan. Trump leaves out that Japanese automakers have plants in the U.S., so these cars are not really being shipped overseas, as he implied. Japan does not impose a \"massive tax\" on U.S. autos but protects the industry with non-tariff barriers.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
