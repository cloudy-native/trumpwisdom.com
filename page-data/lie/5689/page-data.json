The U.S. jobless rate for Asians has been around for less than 20 years. Although the black unemployment rate was at an all-time-low 5.9 percent in May, it had risen to 6 percent in September. That was still significantly higher than the overall unemployment rate of 3.7 percent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"17491, 17194, 17304, 17373, 17257, 17096, 14896, 14432, 15284, 15313, 15339, 13193, 12826, 12838, 12725, 12752, 12670, 12715, 12298, 12482, 11597, 11645, 11218, 12204, 12253, 11574, 11689, 11549, 12085, 11372, 12046, 11701, 12220, 12017, 11927, 11509, 11893, 11226, 11827, 11867, 11171, 11790, 11146, 11052, 10980, 10710, 10607, 10523, 10417, 10861, 10380, 10350, 10240, 10186, 10217, 10090, 10001, 10037, 9700, 9514, 9436, 9384, 9111, 9022, 9059, 8954, 8900, 8721, 8227, 7924, 7852, 7454, 7142, 7058, 6221, 6185, 6194, 6200, 6171, 6108, 6065, 6053, 5822, 5836, 5778, 5689, 4785, 4837, 4947, 4956, 4765, 4737, 4685, 4716, 4701, 4672, 4673, 4658, 4563, 4571, 4547, 4514, 4521, 4064, 3961, 2454, 2387","repeated_count":"107","date":"09/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
