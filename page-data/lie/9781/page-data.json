They read what the lawyer tells them to read. They're gang members. And they say, \"I fear for my life. I...\" They're the ones that are causing fear for life. It's a scam. Okay? It's a scam. It's a hoax. I know about hoaxes.”","analysis":"This is eerily similar to a claim from Attorney General Jeff Sessions when he claimed that \"dirty immigration lawyers\" were coaching their clients to cite credible fear as the reason they were crossing the border. But here's the thing. The data show that people from Central America, where violence and humanitarian abuses have surged, make up most of the credible fear claims. About 80 percent of the time, a trained immigration official ruled that the cases are legitimate, requiring a court ruling. There's no concrete evidence to suggest there's weight to this clam.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"10304, 10047, 9905, 9841, 9891, 9781","repeated_count":"6","date":"04/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
