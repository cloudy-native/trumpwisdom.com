The Washington Post and others have reported that world leaders and allied nations often are baffled or upset by Trump's moves and pronouncements. Trump's handling of the coronavirus especially tannked the U.S. reputation. \n“For instance, just 41% in the United Kingdom express a favorable opinion of the U.S., the lowest percentage registered in any Pew Research Center survey there,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/09/15/us-image-plummets-internationally-as-most-say-country-has-handled-coronavirus-badly/\">according to Pew</a>. “In France, only 31% see the U.S. positively, matching the grim ratings from March 2003, at the height of U.S.-France tensions over the Iraq War.
