It all sounded good until I watched Kevin Cernekee, a Google engineer, say terrible things about what they did in 2016 and that they want to “Make sure that Trump losses in 2020.” Lou Dobbs stated that this is a fraud on the American public. @peterschweizer stated with certainty that they suppressed negative stories on Hillary Clinton, and boosted negative stories on Donald Trump. All very illegal. We are watching Google very closely!”","analysis":"There's no evidence that the media or the social media companies such as Google or Facebook did anything to thwart Trump's chances at being elected -- or are trying to rig the upcoming election. Ever the conspiracy theorist, Trump constantly comes up with new ways \"Big Tech\" is trying to undermine him, even as he relies on social media to communicate with his supporters.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"29805, 29884, 29285, 21522, 21330, 19381, 15783, 14768, 13080, 12487, 4754","repeated_count":"11","date":"08/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
