Tell the people “OUT,” and they must leave, just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn. Hiring thousands of “judges” does not work and is not acceptable - only Country in the World that does this!”","analysis":"This is a gross distortion of how immigration and asylum laws work. U.S. policy is to detain adults who are apprehended crossing the border illegally. Children and some adults in some cases are eligible for asylum or legal residence, and there's a vetting process to adjudicate their claims. The U.S. has around 350 immigration judges. There's no evidence that anyone is asking for thousands more. Trump says U.S. immigration laws are weak, but they are comparatively tough and it's the same system used by many countries.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"4289, 3893, 4182, 3438, 3430, 3435, 3569, 3999, 3978, 3488, 3950","repeated_count":"11","date":"07/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
