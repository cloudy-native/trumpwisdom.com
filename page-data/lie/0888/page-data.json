But Hariri is only in power because of a deal he struck with Michel Aoun, Hezbollah’s main Christian ally, to make Aoun president. Hezbollah, the militant group, dominates the Lebanese cabinet and is more powerful than the official Lebanese army, recently launching an operation against a militant group in the eastern town of Arsal. So it’s a bit odd for Trump to suggest the  Lebanese government is fighting Hezbollah.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/25/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
