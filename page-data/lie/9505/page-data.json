His administration has constantly tried to eliminate or reduce funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program for restoring the ecosystem of the Great Lakes, that started under the Obama administration in 2010. Federal funding ranged from nearly $300 million to $450 million a year under Obama. Trump's 2018 budget request would have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-05/documents/fy-2018-congressional-justification.pdf#page=161\">zeroed out all funding</a> -- the administration wanted \"responsibility for funding local environmental efforts and programs to state and local entities\" -- and his 2020 budget would have cut it by 90 percent.
