Now, if we would have said that before the election, that I'm going to create 3.3 million new jobs, we would never have survived the onslaught from the fake news. They would have not accepted it.”","analysis":"Trump took office in January 2017, more than two months after Election Day. Since he's been president, the U.S. has added 2.7 million nonfarm jobs, seasonally adjusted. During the campaign, Trump pledged to create 25 million jobs over the following decade (there was no \"onslaught\" from the media after he made this promise). Using the average monthly job gain since Trump took office, the U.S. would add around 17.5 million jobs if Trump served two terms. That would be only 70 percent of the jobs he promised.
