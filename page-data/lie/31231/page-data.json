Ninety-three point six seven error rate in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's intent. So they're going to a voter intent, 'What did the voter mean by this vote?' Somebody votes for Trump, 'Ah, you know, I think that voter meant something other. He doesn't want Trump, let's just switch it around.\"'Think of that, they're trying to determine the voter's intent in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000 ballots.”","analysis":"Another fantasy offered by Trump. The Dominion software has a function that flags ballots for adjudication based on defects such as improperly filled bubbles on the ballot or overvotes, when a voter votes for more candidates than allowed. In Fulton County, 113,130 absentee ballots were scanned, and more than 106,000 were adjudicated. (The number includes all ballots in a batch, even if only one ballot needed to be checked.) The vote counts were reconfirmed with two recounts.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/04/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
