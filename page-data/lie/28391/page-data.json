[Serbia and Kosovo have] been fighting for 40 years. I think they'd been fighting for 400 years, you want to know the truth, but they've been fighting for a long time. They want to make a deal. All of a sudden, two months ago, they're in the Oval Office, hugging, the two prime mini -- hugging, and kissing...I mean, we're going to do these two deals. Tell them to stop fighting, and we save a lot of lives.”","analysis":"Trump falsely-- and bizarrely -- takes credit for ending a war between Serbia and Kosovo that ended more than two decades ago. Despite continued tensions, the two sides have not directly fought each other since 1999. Trump helped negotiate an economic normalization deal between Kosovo and Serbia, but that agreement mostly involved economic and transportation links, and it did not solve tougher geopolitical issues like Serbia’s refusal to recognize Kosovo ever since the country declared its independence in 2008.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30386, 30272, 29720, 30033, 28579, 28391, 27963, 28257","repeated_count":"8","date":"10/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
