Tony knows that very well. Tony wasn't sure -- really sure I would say at the beginning. What do you think? I don't know him very well. But I think you are very happy now, Tony. Right? Something I am very proud of: I stopped the Johnson Amendment from interfering with pastors' rights to speak their mind. You can say whatever you want, you're the people we want to hear from.”","analysis":"The president sometimes implies that he got rid of the amendment with an executive order, but that isn't the case. Religious leaders are still prohibited from supporting or endorsing political candidates in their official capacities, and continue to be barred from doing so as a condition of their tax-exempt status.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"25021, 20322, 17236, 15932, 15376, 13938, 11490, 10373, 6545, 6659, 4671, 4516, 10420, 1967, 10422, 0831, 10972, 10976","repeated_count":"18","date":"10/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
