New and expanded plants are happening all over the U.S. We have not only saved this important industry, but created many jobs. Also, billions paid to our treasury. A BIG WIN FOR U.S.”","analysis":"This is mostly false. Steel plants are not roaring back to life after Trump imposed steel and aluminum tariffs. In fact, trade and economic experts say the tariffs could cost U.S. jobs. Although some investments have been announced, there are not \"expanded plants\" being built \"all over the U.S.\" The steel industry was not going out of business, as Trump suggests. Big integrated steel mills had trouble competing with more nimble and efficient mini-mills.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29780, 29347, 29493, 29749, 29123, 28074, 28325, 26632, 24774, 23474, 20989, 19323, 17936, 17109, 17286, 18151, 16197, 15437, 15830, 14939, 14020, 13773, 12291, 11631, 12041, 12199, 11458, 11800, 11026, 10579, 10941, 10314, 10288, 9977, 9990, 9755, 9666, 9392, 8872, 8847, 8572, 8508, 8068, 7969, 7977, 7397, 7421, 7017, 7441, 6789, 6938, 6973, 6792, 6771, 7061, 6576, 6279, 6284, 6122, 5400, 5586, 5613, 5263, 5784, 5652, 4791, 4589, 4703, 4604, 4711, 4414, 4278, 4570, 4533, 4560, 3764, 3447, 3448, 2791, 2496, 2499, 2467","repeated_count":"82","date":"01/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
