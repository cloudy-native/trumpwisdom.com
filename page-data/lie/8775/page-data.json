The FBI's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-12\">Uniform Crime Report for 2017</a> shows that the total for homicides and nonnegligent manslaughters increased 1.6 percent in 2017 in cities, even as it declined overall nationwide. Cities with more than 1 million residents saw crime decline 8 percent. But cities with 500,000 to 1 million residents saw these crimes increase, as did cities with 25,000 to 250,000 residents.
