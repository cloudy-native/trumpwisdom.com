They got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it, which is also logically and logistically impossible, right? Think of that one. You got the ballot back, let's send the ballots, so they've already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I don't think that's too good, right?”","analysis":"\"This appears to be based on a misunderstanding of how election data are collected,\" said {The Philadelphia Inquirer}. \"After you apply for a mail ballot, a worker processes and approves the application, then prints and mails a ballot to you. Later, when you return the ballot, the barcode on the envelope is scanned to acknowledge that it was received, which updates the voter history. All of that depends on workers manually updating the system, and they were usually dealing with a massive backlog of ballots and applications. That means, for example, that a ballot application could have been received days before it was processed, or a ballot could be received weeks or even months before it was marked as received. It’s not an automated system, and the data are imperfect.\"\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/06/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
