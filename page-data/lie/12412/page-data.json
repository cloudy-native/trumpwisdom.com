It was like this. … And the opponent [Hillary Clinton] went there with Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, and she went there much earlier primetime 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock in the morning is not exactly primetime. So we had 32,000 and they had a tiny little crowd.”","analysis":"As usual, Trump inflates the number of people attending one of his rallies. The Detroit Free Press <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/11/08/donald-trump-holds-late-night-rally-grand-rapids/93447114/\">reported</a> that night that DeVos Place in downtown Grand Rapids, Mich., where Trump held a midnight rally, has a capacity of 4,200, far less than the 32,000 that Trump claimed. Clinton held her rally the same day at nearby Grand Valley State University; it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://anchor.hope.edu/world/clinton-visits-grand-valley-state-university/\">described</a> as a \"capacity crowd\" at a venue that holds 4,100 people. Neither Barack nor Michelle Obama attended this Clinton rally, so this claim from Trump is false in every way.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30291, 30316, 29648, 28797, 28139, 27446, 25051, 24635, 18321, 12412, 5430","repeated_count":"11","date":"08/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
