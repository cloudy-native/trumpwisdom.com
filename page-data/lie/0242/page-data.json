The Congressional Research Service concluded in 2015 that NAFTA likely had little impact on jobs. Manufacturing jobs in the United States have been adversely affected by many factors, especially changing consumer tastes and technology. Similarly, drawing a connection between China’s entry in the WTO and factory loses is a stretch, especially because the Great Recession play a big role in factory closings.
