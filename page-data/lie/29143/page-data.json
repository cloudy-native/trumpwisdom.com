But the complaint says he tossed all sorts of mail, including approximately 69 mixed class pieces of flat rate mail, 320 second-class pieces of mail, and two national election campaign flyers from a political party in Florida. The 111 general election absentee ballots from the Jefferson County Clerk’s Office were being mailed to voters to be filled out. “An analysis of the mail revealed it was from a single route for one scheduled delivery day,” prosecutors said.
