Andrew McCabe, who is now the acting FBI director, became part of the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails long after his wife, Jill McCabe, unsuccessfully ran for a Virginia Senate seat. The political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) gave $452,500 to McCabe, and the state Democratic Party gave her campaign an additional $207,788. That was about one-third of the $1.8 million budget for her campaign. McAuliffe is close to Clinton, but there is no evidence she knew of the contributions. Moreover, it stretches the imagination that McAuliffe would know that the husband of someone he was supporting in a Virginia legislative race was going to be promoted months later to a position of authority in the email case.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25374, 24024, 23775, 12038, 9580, 8894, 8807, 6076, 4334, 3129, 2987, 2942, 2728, 2577, 2321, 1940, 1944, 1678, 0929, 0866, 0830","repeated_count":"21","date":"04/15/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
