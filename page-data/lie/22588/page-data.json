I made a great deal with China. They're buying 40 billion to 50 billion worth of our farm product, $250 billion overall including manufacturing. The problem is that the ink had not dried. It wasn't even dry when all of a sudden we had to go out and the virus started coming in. The plague I call it started coming in from China. So, I feel a lot differently about the whole situation. We made a great trade deal.”","analysis":"That wasn't the problem. Trump is blaming the coronavirus pandemic for the failure of what almost every analyst says was a flawed trade deal from the start.
