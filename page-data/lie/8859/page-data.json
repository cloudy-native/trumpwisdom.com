And the numbers that I have from Homeland Security are a disaster. And you know what else is a disaster? The numbers that come out of Homeland Security, Kirstjen, for the cost that we spend and the money that we lose because of illegal immigration: Billions and billions of dollars a month.”","analysis":"When Trump was challenged by a reporter on his facts and figures, he insisted he got them from the Department of Homeland Security. But he actually got them from his TV set. On Jan. 27, he tweeted that the cost of illegal immigration so far this year was $18,959,495,168. We <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/29/president-trump-tweets-nonsensical-figures-illegal-immigration/?utm_term=.17f1a88963ae\">traced that number</a> to a report on the right-leaning One America News Network. The figure appears to be based on an estimate from an outside group, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), though the OAN figure was considerably higher. FAIR has been a source for Trump before, but its estimates have been fiercely disputed. The Cato Institute, which favors immigration, said the study had serious methodological errors that, once considered, reduced the fiscal cost to $3.3 billion to $15.6 billion before accounting for economic activity generated by immigrants in the country illegally.\n\nIn any case, the president is not relying on a DHS estimate.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
