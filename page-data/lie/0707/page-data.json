Trump also uses the calculation of premium increases without incorporating the impact of tax credits — which most people in the exchanges receive. If you take the subsidies into account, the average monthly premium of most people in the individual market exchange goes down, not up. Finally, it’s an apples-to-oranges comparison by using figures from 2013 — before most major provisions of Obamacare had taken effect — and comparing them to ones from 2017.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"6005, 5138, 1440, 1468, 1229, 1230, 1231, 1216, 1078, 0901, 0788, 0738, 0732, 0708, 0707, 0252","repeated_count":"16","date":"06/08/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
