This would have made NAFTA look like a good deal. The TPP would have decimated U.S. manufacturer and gutted America's auto industry. It would have gutted the industry and they were dying to do this crazy deal....TPP -- what a mess. That was another one of these deals that was set up for the strict purpose of taking wealth out of the United States for the benefit of those other countries that were in the deal. It was a one-sided horror show.”","analysis":"Under the TPP, the United States would have had up to 30 years to phase out tariffs on cars and light trucks imported from Japan. But overall the impact on the auto industry was believed to be limited. The pact essentially preserved the status quo on trucks in the United States, the most profitable part of the market. Tariffs on trucks brought into the U.S. has forced foreign carmakers to build truck and SUV plants in the United States. Meanwhile, the TPP would have bolstered auto exports as other countries would have been forced to eliminate tariffs, such as Malaysia’s 30 percent foreign tax on autos, and Vietnam’s foreign tax of 70 percent on autos.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29694, 30506, 29600, 30012, 29109, 28782, 27835, 26663, 27467, 26117, 25254, 25894, 24092, 24002, 16192, 16334, 15517, 12422, 10245, 9540","repeated_count":"20","date":"04/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
