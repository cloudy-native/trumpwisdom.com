She had more to do, in the campaign, with Russia than I did. I had nothing to do. And, by the way, that's one other thing. If you look, this was all about Russia, Russia, Russia. They don't talk about Russia anymore because it turned out to be a hoax.”","analysis":"Throughout the special counsel’s investigation of possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump sought to deflect attention by asserting that the Democrats colluded with Russia. But he has little evidence to make his case, which largely rests on the fact that the firm hired by Democrats to examine Trump’s Russia ties at the same time was working to defend a Russian company in U.S. court. (Sometimes Trump suggests Ukraine, not Russia, was involved.) In fact, U.S. intelligence agencies found that Russian entities hacked Democratic leaders' email during the campaign. The investigation was started because of a tip from an Australian diplomat, who said a Trump campaign official disclosed Russia had obtained damaging information concerning Hillary Clinton. It was not started because of reports generated by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent, on behalf of Democrats. In late 2019, the DOJ Inspector General <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf#page=4\">in a report</a> affirmed the investigation did not stem from the Steele dossier but instead from the tip from a friendly foreign government. \"This information provided the FBI with an articulable factual basis that, if true, reasonably indicated activity constituting either a federal crime or a threat to national security, or both, may have occurred or may be occurring,\" the report said. (Little in the Steele dossier was ever confirmed, even by the FBI which studied it carefully.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"29793, 30463, 26500, 26298, 26320, 26074, 25663, 25938, 25821, 25116, 23000, 21075, 21709, 17181, 16380, 16365, 15903, 13880, 13057, 12907, 12956, 11657, 11674, 12241, 11860, 11862, 11871, 11772, 11765, 11745, 11010, 11087, 10917, 10748, 10791, 10442, 10452, 10658, 10773, 10569, 10576, 10392, 10536, 9863, 10078, 10018, 9969, 9739, 9562, 9233, 9180, 8914, 8702, 9459, 8547, 8346, 8512, 8516, 8114, 7747, 7710, 7279, 7429, 7270, 7214, 7171, 5555, 6074, 5590, 5391, 6060, 5025, 4734, 4735, 4611, 4680, 4501, 4384, 4467, 4331, 4269, 3954, 3662, 3630, 3643, 3617, 3444, 3313, 3322, 3249, 3137, 2985, 2948, 2943, 2724, 2604, 8933, 2308, 2308, 2034, 2106, 1983, 1983, 1979, 1891, 1891, 1898, 1965, 1539, 1539, 1568, 1568, 1412, 1412, 0010","repeated_count":"115","date":"05/30/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
