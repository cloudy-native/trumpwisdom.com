Congress this summer passed — and Trump signed — authorization for $716 billion in spending in fiscal 2019. But Trump referred to these defense budgets as a “record,\" which is wrong. The budget authority was larger in fiscal years 2010 and 2011 in nominal dollars, and outlays was higher in many years, including recently, in inflation-adjusted dollars. A better way to measure over time is as a percentage of the economy, and Trump’s is only one-third the size of the defense budget at the height of the Vietnam War.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/25/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
