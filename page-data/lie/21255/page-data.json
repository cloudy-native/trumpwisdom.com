It was an area that was pretty much over. After, after, a month later, it started going up. That's a month later, but Tulsa was a very good, Oklahoma was doing very well as a state. It was almost free.”","analysis":"Actually, the builder of this barrier, Tommy Fisher, is {a major contractor on the project}. The private group Trump accused of trying to make him look bad was We Build the Wall,  which aised more than $20 million telling donors it would put up barriers on private land along the U.S. southern border. The group’s board members were well-connected right-wing celebrities led by former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon. Bannon and three others from We Build the Wall have been arrested and accused of fraud for allegedly siphoning more than $1.3 million away from the project. (They pleaded not guilty.) But the barrier in question was built by Fisher. Less than a month after this tweet, Fisher won his third contract from the Trump administration, for $289 million.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
