Where are they going? Who are they sending them to? Are they sending them to certain areas and not other areas? Are they sending them to Democrat areas? These are all controlled by Democrat Governors.”","analysis":"All wrong. Some states were mailing ballots to all registered voters, accounting for 51 million voters combined, according to a Washington Post tally. (In California alone, that means 20 million ballots were mailed.) Other states, with a combined 44 million voters, were simply mailing ballot applications. In all of these cases, people had to register to vote before receiving a ballot or ballot application in the mail. Trump falsely and with no evidence suggests ballots were not being sent to Republican neighborhoods.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
