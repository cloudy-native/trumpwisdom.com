The statement said North Korea committed to “work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The phrase is not defined and “toward” is rather weak. In the past, North Korea viewed “denuclearization” to mean the United States removing the nuclear umbrella it provides to Japan and South Korea; there is no indication its definition has changed.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
