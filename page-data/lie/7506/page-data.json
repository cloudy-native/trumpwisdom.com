We will stop them. Catch and Detain! Judicial Activism, by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens, is putting our country in great danger. Not good!”","analysis":"Any crowd of 7,000 people is going to have some bad apples, but Trump is wrong to claim \"many are stone cold criminals.\" Mexican officials have already identified several and deported them, so they are no longer a potential threat. Trump's figure of 300 people is based on a fuzzy news release to justify presidential assertions, and officials refused to explain how the numbers were calculated. Still, numbers issued by DHS — 270 to 470 — are roughly consistent with the percentage of people with criminal pasts — 5 percent — in the 2014 surge. So it may not be completely out of line even if the possible criminality is hyped.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"11421, 8827, 8600, 8641, 8329, 7719, 7732, 7703, 7577, 7578, 7327, 7331, 7515, 7546, 7521, 7522, 7535, 7506, 6728, 6958, 6982, 7102, 7105, 7106, 7149, 6798, 6817, 6515, 6605, 6748, 6752, 6753, 7031, 7032, 7034, 7075, 7087, 7093, 6534, 6536, 6548, 6549, 6558, 6630, 6652, 6653, 6268, 6269, 6293, 6231, 5984, 6011, 6187, 6196, 6197, 5202, 6334, 6340, 6354, 6355, 6135, 6137, 6159, 6422, 6455, 6456, 6457, 6458, 6468, 5458, 5461, 5489, 5491","repeated_count":"73","date":"11/21/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
