Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse.

DISGRACEFUL!”","analysis":"IG Michael Horowitz was appointed by Obama but previously was nominated by George W. Bush to the U.S. Sentencing Commission. IGs are supposed to be politically independent and Horowitz was no friend of the Obama administration, writing a critical report on the \"Fast and Furious\" controversy. Trump also overstates the claim of \"FISA abuse,\" as it is disputed whether the FBI failed to follow regular protocols in arranging for a wiretap of former campaign advisor Carter Page.
