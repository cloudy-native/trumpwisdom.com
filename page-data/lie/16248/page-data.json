That was long before I ever decided to do this.”","analysis":"Trump claims he won Michigan’s “man of the year” award. But there’s no evidence this is true. FactCheck.org investigated and it appears Trump is referring to a 2013 dinner hosted by a county Republican Party organization, which presented him with token gifts — including a statuette of Abraham Lincoln. But a former Republican congressman who organized the dinner said Trump was not given an award and the group has never named a “man of the year.” Nevertheless, as of August, Trump had made this false claim seven times over three years.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"29936, 30503, 29461, 29082, 28724, 28162, 27350, 25050, 23843, 22453, 21442, 18853, 19731, 18251, 16431, 16248, 12409, 12337, 12335, 12336","repeated_count":"20","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
