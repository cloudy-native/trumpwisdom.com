In 2016 when Joe & his wacky future ex-wife, Mika, would endlessly interview me, I would always be thinking.... ....about whether or not Joe could have done such a horrible thing? Maybe or maybe not, but I find Joe to be a total Nut Job, and I knew him well, far better than most. So many unanswered & obvious questions, but I won't bring them up now! Law enforcement eventually will?”","analysis":"Trump weaponized a baseless conspiracy theory -- that MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough possibly murdered an aide in 2001 -- in response to the tough coverage he received on \"Morning Joe,\" especially during the covid-19 pandemic. It's one of the most vicious falsehoods in this database. Scarborough was a Republican member of Congress representing Florida's first congressional district in 2001. In July of that year, a member of his staff named Lori Kaye Klausutis, 28, died from a fall related to an undiagnosed heart disease in what police and the medical examiner determined was an accidental death. Scarborough was in Washington when the death occurred at his district office in Fort Walton Beach, Fla. Klausutis died of an acute subdural hematoma. The medical examiner reported that Klausutis lost consciousness most likely from an undiagnosed floppy mitral valve, which caused her to fall and hit her head fatally on a desk. An autopsy ruled out that Klausutis might have died from receiving a blow to the head. Police said a colleague of hers and a mail carrier had both heard her say she was not feeling well the day before she was found. Indeed, all the evidence in this case contradicts Trump, and yet he keeps tweeting and promoting the Scarborough conspiracy theory and calling for authorities to open a new investigation into the TV host. Trump also claims that Scarborough's resignation from Congress is somehow linked to Klausutis's death, when in fact Scarborough had announced his exit almost two months earlier. Trump sometimes falsely claims with no evidence that Klausutis, a devout Catholic who was married, was having an affair with Scarborough. He has retweeted users and articles that promote conspiracy theories about her death. And he has insisted with the claim even after Klausutis's widower wrote <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/business/letter-to-twitter-ceo.html\">a letter</a> asking Twitter to remove the offending tweets. T.J. Klausutis wrote that \"the President of the United States has taken something that does not belong to him — the memory of my dead wife — and perverted it for perceived political gain.\"","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"20362, 19377, 19339, 19780, 19768, 19748, 19740, 18906, 18911, 18890, 1734","repeated_count":"11","date":"05/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
