Well, do you know how insulting that is?”","analysis":"Democrats and independent experts have pointed out the large power disparity between Trump and Zelensky. Ukraine has been at war with Russia since 2014 and relies on U.S. military and diplomatic support to defend itself and negotiate peace terms from a position of strength. It’s not an insult to point out that under such precarious circumstances, the Ukrainian president would be hard-pressed to refuse any request from his American counterpart or contradict him in public.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
