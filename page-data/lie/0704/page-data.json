And hundreds of billions of dollars was spent and given to American companies who are going to make American products and send those products over to the wealthy countries of the Middle East. I mean hundreds of billions of dollars. To me that was very important because we want those jobs. We want those jobs.”","analysis":"A review of the deals shows that many deals are not concluded and are simply aspirational. Moreover, many of the investments are in Saudi Arabia, making it difficult to argue that these will create many jobs for Americans. Other deals, such as the SoftBank fund and ExxonMobil Chemical deal in Texas, had been announced months earlier and thus are not appropriate for inclusion on a list of achievements from the president’s visit.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"17202, 15050, 13631, 11933, 11250, 10870, 10250, 7307, 7527, 7542, 7248, 7256, 7258, 7231, 6188, 6189, 6205, 6207, 6330, 6331, 6136, 6416, 6420, 6446, 6447, 6125, 6131, 5938, 5939, 5967, 5866, 5870, 5935, 6063, 2706, 0832, 0832, 0704, 0643, 0630, 0618, 0588","repeated_count":"42","date":"06/21/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
