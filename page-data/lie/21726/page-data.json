(The state numbers that Trump tosses around -- 1 million or more -- are also dubious.) In fact, officials told Reuters that the number referred not to jobs saved, but the total number of workers reported by businesses approved for a loan under the program. “The PPP likely did not save 51 million jobs, or anywhere close to it, Reuters <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-ppp-jobs-insight/trump-says-he-saved-51-million-jobs-in-pandemic-economists-u-s-officials-say-otherwise-idUSKBN25N1IZ\">concluded</a> after interviews with economists and an analysis of the program’s data. “Half a dozen economists put the number of jobs saved by the initiative at only a fraction of 51 million – ranging between one million and 14 million.” Moreover, the Washington Post <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/14/ppp-job-claims-sba/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_politics\">dug into the data</a> behind the 51-million-figure, collected by the Small Business Administration, and found “half a dozen businesses that said they had fewer employees than the SBA reported the businesses had retained. Bankers also said employment figures for hundreds of businesses had been incorrectly reported by the SBA.”  For instance, Fire Protection Systems, a sprinkler system installer in Kent, Wash., retained more than 500 jobs using its PPP funds, according to the data. But the company says it has only 20 employees.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"31595, 31192, 31108, 30950, 29057, 28452, 28219, 25044, 24917, 24840, 24672, 23871, 23697, 23501, 22433, 22535, 22166, 21726, 20781","repeated_count":"19","date":"07/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
