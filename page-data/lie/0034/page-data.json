Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria, it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim, you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible, and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians. And I thought it was very, very unfair.”","analysis":"Trump goes too far to claim that it is “very tough” for Syrian Christians to become refugees in the United States and that they have been “horribly treated.” While it is correct that a relatively small percentage of Syrian refugees have been admitted, the experience of Iraqi refugees is exactly the opposite, even though the same U.N. agency handles the refugee requests. The basic fact is that no one fully understands why there is such a disparity, though it appears connected to the roots the Syrians have with Lebanon.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/27/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
