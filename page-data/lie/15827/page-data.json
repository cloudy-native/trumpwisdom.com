And the net result of what happens environmentally is a very positive result because a lot of old cars are going to come off the road. And they won't come off the road with the California standard, but they'll come off the road with our standard.”","analysis":"Trump is arguing against higher fuel efficiency standards by making an economic and safety argument rejected by many experts and that most automakers do not want. The rule to rollback Obama-era standards being written by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposal has nothing to do with making new cars safer; in fact, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://apnews.com/1a7551fca3294ec49029b93e994cd7f9\">internal EPA emails released in 2018</a> said the rule change would increase highway fatalities. He also falsely claims there would be little environmental impact. Experts say any potential savings on the sticker price of new cars would likely be offset by the increased fuel cost over the life of those vehicles, even if gas prices stay low. With less fuel-efficient cars, the rollback could also introduce hundreds of millions of metric tons of CO2 into the air, and increase oil consumption by more than 1 billion barrels, according to the EPA’s own estimates.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"28785, 21179, 19167, 17746, 17443, 16543, 15827, 14784, 13542, 12786, 12812, 13735, 13150, 12559, 12566, 12567","repeated_count":"16","date":"12/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
