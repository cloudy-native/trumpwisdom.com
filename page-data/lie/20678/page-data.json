Nobody brought it to me. But they said, 'It didn't rise to that level.' And that's okay with me.”","analysis":"After numerous news reports that U.S. intelligence believed that Russia was paying the Taliban bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Trump has falsely tried to dismiss it as a \"hoax\" ginned up by Democrats.

The intelligence reports were contained in the presidential daily brief, which Trump is said not to read carefully, but apparently Trump's briefer did not bring the subject to his attention.
