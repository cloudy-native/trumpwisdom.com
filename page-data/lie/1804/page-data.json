That pool is now coming back.  As you know, that's not considered in the low employment numbers, which means we have a lot of people that want to get to work, and that will be working.”","analysis":"This is an absurd Four-Pinocchio claim, based on a real number. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, relying on a monthly survey known as the Current Population Survey (CPS), shows that, as of November 2017, 95.4 million Americans 16 years and older were “not in labor force.” How is this number developed? Well, there is a civilian noninstitutional population of 255.9 million people, and 160.5 million are in the labor force. The difference yields the 95.4 million figure. But the unemployment rate is only 4.1 percent because just 6.2 million people actively are looking for a job and cannot find one. They are considered part of the overall labor force. In other words, you have to be seeking a job to be counted in the labor force. Who are the 95 million not in the labor force? The BLS has data for the year 2015. It turns out that 93 percent do not want a job at all. The picture that emerges from a study of the data shows that the 95 million consists mostly of people who are retired, students, stay-at-home parents or disabled. (In fact, contrary to Trump's statement, this figure has grown during his presidency.)","pinocchios":"4","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/06/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
