Just mail it in. On Election Day or early voting, go to your polling place, even though you've mailed it in, go to your polling place to see whether or not your mail-in vote has been tabulated or counted,” Trump said. If it has, you will not be able to vote because it’s going to be counted. You'll not be able to vote and the mail-in system worked properly as it should. But there’s a big chance that it won't work properly. So if it hasn't been counted, if it doesn't show up, go and vote and then if your mail-in ballot arrives after you vote — which it shouldn't, but possibly it could, perhaps — that ballot will not be used or counted in that your vote has already been cast and tabulated. This way you're guaranteed to have your vote counted. So send it in and then see and then vote and let’s see what happens. You’re now assured your very precious and important vote has been counted. It hasn't been lost or thrown out or in any way destroyed. So important to do that because this is going to be the biggest election in the history of our country.”","analysis":"Trump told North Carolina voters to vote twice. That's illegal in the state. Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article245509345.html\">said in a message</a> Thursday that voting twice in an election, attempting to vote twice or soliciting someone to do so is a violation of North Carolina law. North Carolina has three ways to track your absentee by-mail ballot: checking the state’s website, signing up for BallotTrax, which is set to launch in a few days, or by contacting your county board of elections. “The State Board office strongly discourages people from showing up at the polls on Election Day to check whether their absentee ballot was counted. That is not necessary, and it would lead to longer lines and the possibility of spreading COVID-19,” Brinson Bell wrote in a message.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/04/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
