They did reduce purchases from China but the tariffs caused American companies and consumers to shift purchases to other countries, like Mexico, Vietnam and South Korea. There would be no impact on the overall trade deficit unless manufacturing shifted back to the United States. Instead, increased domestic oil production in 2019 was a major factor in the shrinking trade deficit, cutting into imports of foreign crude oil by $30.3 billion last year. A cooling U.S. economy was another factor.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
