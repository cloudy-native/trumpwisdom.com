So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion!”","analysis":"Justice Department regulations required Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. DOJ officials are not allowed to investigate political campaigns of which they were a part, and Sessions was an early and active Trump surrogate during the 2016 presidential race. There's no evidence that the special counsel investigation is a witch hunt or a hoax. In fact, the special counsel has revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The investigation into potential collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign continues, and no conclusions have been announced.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
