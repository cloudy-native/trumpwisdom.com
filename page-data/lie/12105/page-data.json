No, they ride through the desert and they make a left, where you don't have the wall.”","analysis":"Trump depicts a movie fantasy here. With false passports and other documents, people are smuggled through legal points of entry, including airports. Justice Department news releases announcing convictions of sex traffickers often note how they thwarted checks at legal points of entry, such as obtaining fraudulent visas and travel documents by funding false bank accounts and creating fictitious backgrounds and occupations. Even people who make the long trek through Mexico with a smuggler often cross the border hidden in an 18-wheel truck, crammed with dozens of other people.It's also ridiculous to say human trafficking is \"almost impossible\" by plane. More likely than not, foreign nationals who are trafficked come through legal ports of entry. Data collected by the United Nations’ International Organization on Migration, analyzing 10 years of information on more than 90,000 victims, has found that 79 percent of international trafficking journeys “go through official border points, such as airports and land border control points.” The IOM said that “about a third of official border points are crossed by bus, another third by train, and 20 percent by plane.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
