And you were really one of the biggest victims, this state. You lost 50% of your manufacturing jobs after Biden's NAFTA and China disasters. They were disasters.”","analysis":"Trump often blames trade deals for the decline in American manufacturing, but experts say it's hard to isolate their effect on jobs. Meanwhile, technological advances such as automation and low wages in manufacturing powerhouses such as China also played a role in declining manufacturing in the U.S., though Trump rarely if ever acknowledges these factors. (For many months, Trump claimed one in three manufacturing jobs was lost to trade deals but as the 2020 election approached, he boosted the statistic to 50 percent.)
