To capture what happened after some of the Obamacare provisions went into effect, that's an increase of $1,761. Moreover, since the Affordable Care Act became law, the rate of increase in healthcare costs have slowed. It is still debated by experts about whether the law gets all of the credit, but if costs had continued on the previous path, premiums would have been $3,600 higher.
