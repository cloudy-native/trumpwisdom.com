If you're the President of the United States and you get defrauded out of an election, you should be able to file a suit, but we can't do that. They say, 'Sir, you don't have standing.' How about that?

The court said exas lacked standing to pursue the case, saying it “has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections.” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, said he would have allowed the case to be heard, for technical reasons, but he offered little hope he would have granted Trump the relief he sought.  “I would therefore grant the motion to file the bill of complaint but would not grant other relief,” Justice Alito wrote, “and I express no view on any other issue.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/04/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
