And if I didn’t, we would have a chart that you wouldn't believe. So how would I know to do that? ...I mean, you have to make a decision. People knew that some bad things were going on, and they got off to a late start. And some others got off to a late start also. But we cut off China. If we didn't cut off China, we would have been in some big trouble. And we cut it off.”","analysis":"In Trump’s telling, he took bold action to ban many foreign travelers from China to stop the spread of covid-19. He claimed the United States instituted its ban before every other country. Not quite. The World Health Organization has cautioned against such travel restrictions, saying they are ineffective against a virus and in the long run counterproductive. Trump, according to news reports, was initially skeptical and worried about provoking China after signing a major trade deal. But his national security and public health experts convinced him that the move would buy time to put in place effective prevention and testing measures. Six countries imposed travel restrictions even before the WHO declared a global health emergency on Jan. 30. Another six announced travel restrictions that same day, followed by 11 countries (besides the United States) announcing restrictions Jan. 31. But most countries imposed the restrictions immediately. By the time Trump’s restrictions took effect Feb. 2, an additional 15 countries had taken similar actions — and in some cases enacted even tougher bans. That adds up to 38 countries taking action before or at the same time the U.S. restrictions were put in place. We should note that among members of the powerful Group of 20, Trump has more of a point — the United States was third, after Italy and Australia.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
