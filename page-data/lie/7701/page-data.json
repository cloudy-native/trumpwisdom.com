But I think that they will get it pretty soon. I really do. I mean, the fact is that the economy is doing so well, that they raised interest rates, and this is a form of safety, in a way. And President Obama didn't do much of that, much easier to run when you have no interest rate. He had a very low interest rate. We have a normalized interest rate.”","analysis":"Trump, in an unusual move for a president, has complained loudly about the Federal Reserve raising interest rates -- even though when he ran for president he complained that they were too low. Obama, of course, faced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, with unemployment reaching 10 percent. The economy is now basically at full employment. Zero percent interest rates would mean the economy was again in a free fall — presumably not something Trump wants.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/25/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
