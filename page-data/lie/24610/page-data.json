They said, 'He didn't lie to the people of the Britain. He didn't lie.' I said, 'Well, let me ask you this, you know, he stood on buildings when the Nazis, Hitler, were bombing London and he was pretty brave because he may have been a little drinking, but he was known for that, right? He's got a right to. He stood in the buildings in London as they were bombing London and made speeches and made statements and had everything and it sometimes have press conferences and the fake news wouldn't show up. He was standing there, nobody was in front of him, but he would stand there and he would say, \"You are safe. You are safe. Everything is OK. You are safe.' Well, that's a lie, I guess, right? So I said, 'Oh, I'd never thought of it that way. I guess he lied.' No, he's a great leader, and he was leading, and he was a great, great prime minister. He did a fantastic job. Not lying. No. We love our country, we want to lead our country and we can't let a thing like this.”","analysis":"Trump <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-woodward-rage-book-trump/2020/09/09/0368fe3c-efd2-11ea-b4bc-3a2098fc73d4_story.html\">called</a> journalist Bob Woodward in February 2020 and \"revealed that he thought the [coronavirus] situation was far more dire than what he had been saying publicly.\" The conversation was not made public until months later, when Woodward published his book, \"Rage.\" “You just breathe the air and that’s how it’s passed,” Trump said in a Feb. 7 call. “And so that’s a very tricky one. That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.” At that time, Trump was telling the nation that the virus was no worse than a seasonal flu, predicting it would soon disappear and insisting that the U.S. government had it totally under control. It would be several weeks before he would publicly acknowledge that the virus was no ordinary flu and that it could be transmitted through the air. It was not until a month later, in a subsequent interview in March, that Trump told Woodward he falsely minimized the coronavirus's risks because he wanted to maintain calm. Later, Trump began to compare himself to Britain's stalwart leader during World War II, Sir Winston Churchill, claiming that Churchill would give speeches projecting calm while bombs fell on his country. Historians <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/09/11/trump-churchill-covid-calm/\">noted</a> that many of Churchill’s famed speeches urged Britons to fight to the death — not to carry on as if life were normal.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"24610, 24266, 24226, 23888","repeated_count":"4","date":"09/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
