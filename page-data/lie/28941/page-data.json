'Cause I did. Remember what I did? If I didn't get, if I didn't activate immediately, Kenosha would not be there any longer. They were going to take it down. Biden opposed sending in the National Guard and I insisted on it, and I frankly wish the governor asked me sooner, but at least he asked me. But we came in, and that was over in about another 15 minutes, right? That didn't take long. That didn't take long. And we saved Kenosha, so you still have Kenosha.”","analysis":"Trump takes too much credit for the relative calm that has settled over Kenosha, a city roiled by protests and violence. The governor, not the president, sent the National Guard to Kenosha. And the presence of guardsmen was not the sole factor in tamping down the violence that erupted after a white police officer on Aug. 23 shot and partially paralyzed Jacob Blake in front of his children. The next day, Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin authorized the state National Guard to support local law enforcement. Maj. Gen. Paul E. Knapp, who commands the Wisconsin National Guard, noted that about 1,000 members of the state’s guard were on the scene and said it was the governor who made the final call on the guard’s deployment.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"30160, 28941, 28834, 27589, 27229, 24393, 23899, 23905, 23825, 23464, 23451, 23306, 23046, 23305","repeated_count":"14","date":"10/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
