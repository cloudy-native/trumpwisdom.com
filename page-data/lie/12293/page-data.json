We send them wheat. Wheat. That's not a good deal. And they don't even want our wheat. They do it because they want us to at least feel that we're okay.”","analysis":"This is completely wrong. The United States has a bilateral services trade surplus with Japan, and Japan is a major market for U.S. service providers. The Japanese insurance market is the second largest in the world behind the U.S. market, accounting for nearly 30 percent of all U.S. foreign affiliate sales in the industry. Meanwhile, Japan was the fourth largest goods export market for the United States in 2017, according to the U.S. Trade Representative. International trade works in such a way that some countries dominate some markets and don't compete as much in others. In this case, Japan has a competitive auto industry, but U.S. companies dominate other industries and export heavily to Japan. Trump leaves out that Japanese automakers have plants in the U.S., so these cars are not really being shipped overseas, as he implied. Moreover, there are no import tariffs on cars to Japan. A big problem is that American car dealers have been hesitant to invest in the kind of dealer network that consumers in Japan expect.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/13/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
