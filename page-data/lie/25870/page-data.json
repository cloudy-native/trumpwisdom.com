You know 1%, you can win by 1%, right? Can win by one tenth of 1%, but they're losing like, there was one area, I think 41% of the ballots were missing, 41. These people are crazy.”","analysis":"Results were delayed for several weeks in a New York congressional primary, with Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) eventually declared the winner.

More than 1 in 5 ballots were discarded, many multiples of the final margin,” Suraj Patel, Maloney’s opponent, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/surajpatelnyc/status/1311135111644155909\">wrote on Twitter</a>. “We called our election a canary in the coal mine for November, we were right.
