But Trump falsely takes credit for sending in the National Guard. Deploying the Guard is up to the state governors, not the president. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) already had sent the National Guard to Minneapolis earlier on May 28 when Trump called him and offered to send in the military, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/06/24/reality-check-was-it-president-trump-or-gov-walz-who-called-in-the-national-guard-to-minneapolis/\">according to WCCO CBS Minnesota</a>. The police made a tactical decision to abandon the 3rd Precinct building during the riots, and Walz ordered the National Guard to reclaim the building the next day.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"29825, 30287, 30492, 29559, 30092, 28390, 28762, 28832, 28057, 27588, 27822, 27673, 27081, 27118, 27219, 27349, 27506, 25740, 25570, 26607, 25876, 25066, 25081, 25099, 25033, 24814, 24715, 24516, 24394, 24230, 24256, 24130, 24040, 24057, 23898, 23929, 23824, 23466, 23233, 23198, 23097, 23041, 22072, 21919, 22432, 22471, 22524, 23014, 22985, 22998, 22948, 22972, 21738, 22143, 21857, 21326, 22819, 22851, 22728, 22693, 21389, 22614, 21197, 22575, 20792, 21136, 20849, 20768, 20655, 20582, 20401, 20254, 20767, 20201, 20172, 20275, 20317, 20766","repeated_count":"78","date":"06/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
