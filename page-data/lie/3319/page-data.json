This is not fair, nor is it acceptable. While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%, and NATO benefits....... ...Europe far more than it does the U.S. By some accounts, the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment. On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S., with big Trade Barriers on U.S. goods. NO!”","analysis":"Trump seems to have mixed up millions with billions in his oft-repeated and misleading claim that the EU has a $151 billion trade surplus with the United States (it's actually around $100 billion). The EU and the U.S. have the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world, and both sides impose tariffs and other barriers on different products.  Trump never gets the NATO funding dynamics right. There are two types of funding for NATO: direct funding and indirect funding. Direct funding, for military-related operations, maintenance and headquarters activity, is based on gross national income — the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country — and adjusted regularly. With the largest economy in NATO, the United States pays the largest share — about 22 percent. Germany is second, with about 15 percent. A significant portion of the U.S. share is operating the Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AWACS) fleet, according to the Congressional Research Service. The U.S. share of the actual military budget is negotiated each year, but largely based on the cost-sharing formula, and amounts to less than $500 million a year, according to Defense Department documents. That’s chump change in a $700 billion military budget. As for indirect funding, since 2006, each NATO member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending. At a 2014 summit, responding to Russian aggression in Ukraine, NATO members pledged to meet that guideline by 2024. As of 2017, 12 of the 28 members exceed the guideline — with the United States leading the way at 3.6 percent. But this is simply money that each country would spend on its own military — or on missions that do not include NATO, such as peacekeeping in Africa.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"31587, 29679, 27787, 25395, 24756, 24637, 23788, 23404, 23079, 22087, 22307, 21125, 20811, 20120, 18781, 17719, 17335, 16897, 16644, 16172, 16071, 15010, 14587, 14599, 14670, 15778, 15781, 15787, 15810, 14000, 13618, 13510, 11564, 11411, 11459, 11247, 12249, 10911, 10553, 10557, 10896, 10251, 8359, 8028, 7920, 7928, 7313, 7218, 7488, 7207, 7205, 6226, 6179, 6191, 6406, 6118, 5962, 6098, 6317, 6318, 5361, 5368, 4803, 4821, 4881, 4755, 4767, 4594, 4370, 4586, 4588, 4747, 4748, 4296, 3896, 3733, 3884, 3761, 4188, 4199, 3793, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3626, 3638, 3639, 3779, 4210, 4214, 4215, 3641, 3748, 3751, 3419, 3591, 3646, 3649, 3738, 3740, 3319, 4117, 4118, 4122, 4123, 3600, 3574, 3990, 3402, 3348, 2951, 2785, 2812, 2825, 2839, 2659, 1903, 1873, 1645, 0759, 0761, 0638, 0616, 0598, 0600, 0591, 0592, 0593, 0594, 0524, 0474, 0486, 0422, 0300, 0267, 0256, 0188","repeated_count":"137","date":"07/09/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
