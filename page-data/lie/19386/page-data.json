IT WILL ALSO LEAD TO THE END OF OUR GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE CAN NEVER LET THIS TRAGEDY BEFALL OUR NATION”","analysis":"This is false. There’s no evidence that mail-in balloting favors Democrats over Republicans. Research <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/16/universal-vote-by-mail-doesnt-benefit-any-political-party-study-finds/\">published in 2020</a> found that encouraging widespread voting by mail yielded “a truly negligible effect” on turnout and vote share by party. Nevada and Montana (where the top election officials are Republicans) are sending a mail-in ballot to every voter. GOP Secretaries of State in Georgia, Nebraska, Iowa, and West Virginia have or are sending absentee ballot applications to all voters for their primaries.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/28/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
