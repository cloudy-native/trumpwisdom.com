This Hoax should never be allowed to happen to another President or Administration again!”","analysis":"There is no mystery about the start of the investigation. The FBI counterintelligence investigation was prompted by a tip from the Australian government, which notified U.S. authorities about a conversation over drinks between a Trump campaign aide, George Papadopoulos, and an Australian diplomat in May, 2016. Papadopoulos claimed the Russians had “political dirt” on Clinton. A memo released by the Republican majority of the House Intelligence Committee, which Trump has approvingly cited, confirms the counterintelligence investigation of Russian interference  began in July 2016, because of the tip about Papadopoulos. Attorney General William Barr's summary of the special counsel's report stated: \"The Special Counsel’s report states that 'while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.'\" ","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
