They can do whatever they want for 13 years. India makes its participation contingent on receiving billions and billions and billions of dollars in foreign aid from developed countries.”","analysis":"China, in its Paris Accord commitment, said that, compared to 2005 levels, it would seek to cut its carbon emissions by 60 to 65 percent per unit of GDP by 2030. India said it would reduce its emissions per unit of economic output by 33 to 35 percent below 2005 by 2030; the submission does seek foreign aid to meet its goals and mitigate the costs. Both countries pledge to reach these goals by 2030, meaning they are taking steps now to meet their commitments.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"0953","repeated_count":"1","date":"06/01/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
