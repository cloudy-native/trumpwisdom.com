In reality, there's no evidence that Shokin was investigating Burisma when the elder Biden was pushing for his ouster in late 2015 and early 2016. In fact, the push to remove Shokin was an international effort backed by the Obama administration, the EU, the IMF, the World Bank and anti-corruption advocates in Ukraine. And in fact, one of the reasons the international coalition was pushing for Shokin's ouster was because he was not pursuing the Burisma probe, among others. Furthermore, the White House readout of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not focus on corruption cases generally -- Trump specifically pressed Zelensky to investigate Biden and a conspiracy theory involving the company CrowdStrike. The Trump administration went outside normal channels to withhold security aid for Ukraine as officials pressed for the Burisma investigation, even though the Defense Department certified that Ukraine had made enough strides to root out corruption to merit the aid.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/29/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
