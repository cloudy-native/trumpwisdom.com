Just came out. And on a yearly basis, as you know, the last administration, during an eight-year period, never hit 3 percent.”","analysis":"Trump plays some sleight-of-hand with the numbers. He first cites an annualized quarterly figure — 3 percent GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017 — and then compares it to what appears to be calendar-year figures for former president Barack Obama. But the economy grew better than 3 percent in eight quarters during Obama’s presidency, most recently in the third quarter of 2016.  Trump gets his terminology wrong, using the phrase “yearly basis,” which could mean from the third quarter of 2015 to the the third quarter of 2016, in which case Obama easily exceeded 3 percent numerous times. On an annual basis, Obama’s best year was 2015, when annual growth was 2.6 percent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/30/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
