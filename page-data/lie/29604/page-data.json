He since retired, he had a problem with health. And uh, but fantastic man. And I said, 'No. Shinzo, you have to send plants to Michigan. You have to send plants to the United States.' And he said, 'No, no, no. I cannot do that, that is a private decision.' I said, 'Shinzo, you're a powerful man. I'm sure you can do it.' 'No, no, no.' I said, 'You have to do it Shinzo, because you're making too many cars, sending them here. We want them made in the United States, you have to do it.' He says, 'Well, I can't.' The next day, they announced there were five companies moving to Michigan, and we -- from, uh, Japan. That was Japan. He was, he's a great guy, that one. I'll tell you.”","analysis":"This story is faintly ridiculous in Trump's telling. One can see Trump pressing the Japanese prime minister to force Japanese companies to invest in the United States and Abe explaining that's not how the free market system works. Depending on the venue, Trump sometimes says the next day five auto plants were announced in Michigan -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-claims-he-rewarded-voters-in-michigan-by-persuading-japans-abe-to-get-car-companies-to-put-plants-there-that-didnt-happen-2020-09-22\">false</a> -- or five auto companies made announcements or he simply says \"five companies.\" None of that happened. (There were five new investments by Japanese automakers in Michigan, but only one of them is a manufacturing facility, which was announced on Jan. 30, 2017, just 10 days after Trump took office.) The Financial Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qz.com/905892/japans-shinzo-abe-will-promise-to-invest-more-in-the-us-but-that-probably-wont-shrink-the-trade-deficit-between-the-two-countries/\">reported</a> that Abe requested that Japanese companies thinking of investing in the United States come up with a \"tweetable\" figure for investment. He later gave Trump a chart that listed seven companies making investments, for a total of 14,300 jobs, but these were not all new factories. Moreover, Japanese companies <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trumps-false-auto-industry-claims/\">invested more</a> in the 2014-2016 period before Trump became president.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"30444, 29604, 28649, 27959, 24636","repeated_count":"5","date":"11/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
