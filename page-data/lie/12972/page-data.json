Just 20 minutes after Trump's initial tweet, the National Weather Service Twitter account for Birmingham, Alabama posted: \"Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\" Officials said later they were responding to nervous calls and were unaware of the tweet. For days afterward, Trump falsely insisted he was correct. He marked up a map with a sharpie to indicate Alabama was in the path -- and then pushed officials to repudiate the NWS tweet from Alabama.
