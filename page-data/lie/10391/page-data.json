And impeachment's based on crime. And, specifically it's based on high crimes and misdemeanors.”","analysis":"Congress could choose to impeach the president regardless of Mueller's decisions. The standard for conviction in an impeachment trial is not the same as the standard in the criminal justice system. The outcome of an impeachment trial relies largely on the senators' personal judgments, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://congressionalresearch.com/98-990/document.php?study=STANDARD+OF+PROOF+IN+SENATE+IMPEACHMENT+PROCEEDINGS\">as the Congressional Research Service has noted</a>. As Mueller's report says, there was evidence that the Trump campaign cooperated with Russians during the 2016 election, but not enough to bring conspiracy or illegal coordination charges. There was also significant evidence that Trump obstructed justice. Mueller said he declined to reach a decision on obstruction charges in part because of a Justice Department policy not to indict the sitting president and in part because he didn't want to get in the way of a potential impeachment process in Congress, among other reasons.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"18215, 17086, 16611, 16605, 16177, 16675, 16092, 16028, 16382, 16420, 16309, 15904, 15980, 15863, 15926, 15243, 14578, 11340, 11450, 11103, 10809, 10810, 10750, 10796, 10674, 10391, 10085","repeated_count":"27","date":"05/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
