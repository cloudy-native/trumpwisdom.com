He makes up a statement and he goes in front of Congress where he has immunity, and he makes up a statement from me that’s totally fictitious, totally out of thin air, the worst statement I've ever heard, many people saw it.”","analysis":"Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who led the Trump impeachment inquiry in the House, inserted some extraneous comments as he read the rough transcript of Trump’s July 25 phone call with Zelensky. There is no exact transcript of the conversation, as the summary was cobbled together from notes, so Schiff told the audience “this is the essence of what the president communicates.” Much of what Schiff said tracks the basic contents of the call, but he stretched in claiming Trump asked Zelensky to “make up” or “manufacture” dirt. Trump asked for an investigation of a potential 2020 rival and an investigation into a debunked conspiracy theory that benefits him politically.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"28623, 27705, 27163, 25348, 25823, 24795, 24421, 24282, 23653, 20490, 18837, 19613, 18011, 17612, 18415, 16935, 17049, 18223, 18227, 16776, 16792, 17098, 16413, 16040, 16302, 15973, 15995, 15948, 15235, 15398, 14765, 14919, 14836, 14856, 14728, 14465, 15733, 14544, 14527, 14533, 15300, 15311, 14981, 15263, 14254, 15455, 15495, 15172, 15202, 14301, 14360, 14374, 15156, 15131, 14601, 13988, 14222, 13815, 14224, 14226, 14229, 13896, 13898, 15037, 15045, 15085, 13753, 13797, 12576, 13008, 13589, 13111, 13519, 13571, 13073, 12356, 13049, 13052, 12900, 12943, 12964, 13037, 12867, 12889, 12897, 13437, 13430, 13432, 12879, 12882","repeated_count":"90","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
