Mainstream newsrooms do not create “false narratives.” There are checks and cross checks to ensure that reporting is accurate. When a mistake is made and something incorrect makes it to print, a correction is issued. Reporters are only fired when these errors amount to made up stories or happen on a frequent basis. Moreover, they do not “censor” stories in favor of any candidate.
