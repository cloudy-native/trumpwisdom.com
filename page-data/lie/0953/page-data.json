India said it would reduce its emissions per unit of economic output by 33 to 35 percent below 2005 by 2030; the submission does seek foreign aid to meet its goals and mitigate the costs. Both countries pledge to reach these goals by 2030, meaning they are taking steps now to meet their commitments.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"0613","repeated_count":"1","date":"07/19/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
