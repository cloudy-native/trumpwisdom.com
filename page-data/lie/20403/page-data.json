So we have numerous people in prison right now; others are going there. And we're going to look at that from a standpoint of retroactivity. We can go back and look at some of the damage they've done.”","analysis":"No new laws were enacted. The laws against vandalizing public monuments Trump is referring to were already on the books. Trump repeatedly said people arrested for vandalism during protests over the police killing of George Floyd would face 10-year sentences, but neither state nor federal authorities sought such punishment.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"31298, 30932, 30350, 30163, 30269, 28936, 29108, 28184, 27593, 27827, 27245, 27371, 25131, 24820, 24544, 24345, 23610, 23425, 23250, 23206, 23103, 23110, 22120, 22010, 22385, 21003, 22527, 22999, 22918, 22970, 22142, 22168, 22806, 22820, 21825, 21274, 22671, 21654, 21126, 21137, 20863, 20888, 20750, 20616, 20648, 20583, 20609, 20466, 20474, 20547, 20403","repeated_count":"51","date":"06/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
