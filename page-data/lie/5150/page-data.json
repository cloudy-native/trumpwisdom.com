They used the concept of “time value of money” in doing a very old, boring and often told hit piece on me. Added up, this means that 97% of their stories on me are bad. Never recovered from bad election call!”","analysis":"The New York Times did not apologize to its subscribers for its coverage of Trump. The Times has seen spikes in audience and subscribers. Trump was complaining about a lengthy examination of his taxes, but the \"time value of money\" is not a malicious calculation.The Times story said Trump accumulated  at least $413 million from his father's real estate company using tax fraud and evasion. The figures were adjusted to reflect its 2018 worth in order to place the numbers in context for readers. Trump frequently claims his record high budget for the military and other programs, without accounting for the fact that the numbers, when adjusted for inflation, were actually not a record.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30129, 30525, 27637, 27310, 25967, 24707, 14192, 13343, 12475, 9752, 9919, 8272, 5074, 5150, 4889, 4949, 4950, 4629, 4474, 3642, 4212, 4183, 4142, 3103, 1992, 1727, 1289, 1238, 1065, 0978, 0747, 0746, 0743, 0335, 0163, 0106, 0077, 0050, 0035","repeated_count":"39","date":"10/03/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
