Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!”","analysis":"This tweet is wrong on several levels. Man-made global warming, as the name suggests, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/12/28/after-chilly-forecast-trump-tweets-u-s-could-use-a-little-bit-of-that-good-old-global-warming/?utm_term=.661bfe7ec642\">refers to the steady rise of average temperature of Earth’s climate system</a> because of the buildup of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. So when Trump made his comment, much of the rest of world was warmer than normal even if a portion of the United States was chilly. Moreover, in his broadside against the Paris Climate Accord, Trump once again neglects that it is up to individual countries to decide how they will meet the commitments made under the pact. He could unilaterally change the commitments offered by former President Barack Obama, which is technically allowed under the Accord.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
