And if he would have died like two weeks later, they would have paid 50 percent of the Yankees.”","analysis":"Steinbrenner died in 2010, when the estate tax was briefly repealed (but heavy capital gains taxes kicked in). But in 2011, as much as the first $10 million of an estate was exempt from taxation, and then a 35 percent rate was applied. So Trump is wrong to say the estate would have had to pay a 50 percent tax.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/25/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
