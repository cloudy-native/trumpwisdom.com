They've been -- a lot of bad things were happening. And I talk about soybeans, where, prior to my election -- if you go five years back, soybean prices were cut by 50 percent.”","analysis":"National net farm income, a key indicator of how well farmers are doing, has been declining since 2013 — meaning five, not 15, years. “U.S. farm income experienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 due to strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports,” according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The price of soybeans has not dropped “50 percent since 5 years before the election,” according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. In 2011, five years before the 2016 election, soybeans peaked at $13.40 per bushel. In May 2018, soybeans cost $9.84 per bushel. That’s a 27 percent drop. Measuring since 2011, the lowest price was $8.56 in March 2016. Tariffs and trade barriers are not pushing these prices down; record soybean plantings and record yields are the cause.
