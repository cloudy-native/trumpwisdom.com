Moody's -- respected. And it said that, under the Bush administration, for eight years, median household income went up $400. That's over eight years. Okay? So, remember: $400, eight years. Under President Obama, median household income went up $975 over eight years. Over your favorite President -- President Donald J. Trump -- median household income, for two and a half years -- so remember this: eight years, eight years, 400 bucks -- 400 bucks. You don't even -- that gets wiped out by inflation. Four hundred dollars. Nine hundred and seventy-five dollars.In two and a half years, our number is $5,000, plus $2,000 for the tax cuts. Seven thousand dollars.”","analysis":"Trump is citing data from a private research company that measures median household income on a monthly basis, frequently comparing the gain through August 2019 against the record of Barack Obama and George W. Bush. But measuring gains through presidential terms is misleading, as the nation’s economy is derived from many factors that do not involve presidential decisions — and are far beyond a president’s control. Both Obama and Bush had to contend with recessions. The data cited by Trump, via Sentier Research, is volatile and it's unclear if the recent gains will be sustained. (The Census Bureau said median household income in 2018 was $63,179 in 2018 dollars, a gain of $1,380 since 2016 but not statistically different than in 2017.) When we compare the last 31 months of Obama to the first 31 months of Trump using Sentier's data, median household income rose 5.6 percent under Obama and 7.1 percent under Trump, respectively. Since June 2011 (the low point for median income after the recession) through the end of Obama’s term, median household income rose 10.3 percent. Trump, in effect, is piggybacking off that growth. [Note: the Census Bureau in Sept. 2020 released <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-270.html\">a report</a> that said median income in 2019 was $68,703, or a gain of $5,524 since 2016. But then of course median incomes plunged during the 2020 pandemic.]","pinocchios":"2","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"29592, 30102, 28904, 28332, 27985, 27830, 27720, 26827, 26656, 27086, 27131, 27427, 27300, 26381, 26455, 26200, 26136, 25683, 24914, 24831, 24603, 17267, 15425, 14934, 14562, 15670, 14409, 14083, 14086, 14203, 14589, 13995, 13595","repeated_count":"33","date":"10/23/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
