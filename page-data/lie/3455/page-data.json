Let’s generously assume that (a) each arrest led to a conviction and (b) no person was arrested twice. That means approximately 2.7 percent of all homicides during the 55-year period were committed by non citizens, whether they were legal or undocumented immigrants. Considering they made up 4.6 percent of the U.S. population during that time, according to Nowrasteh, “they were underrepresented among murderers.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
