The problem is that Mexico is an ‘abuser’ of the United States, taking but never giving. It has been this way for decades. Either they stop the invasion of our Country by Drug Dealers, Cartels, Human Traffickers.... ....Coyotes and Illegal Immigrants, which they can do very easily, or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move South of the Border, will be brought back into the United States through taxation (Tariffs). America has had enough!”","analysis":"The huge disparity in labor wages around the world, the relative ease with which companies can relocate or outsource jobs, and the globalized nature of the economy, make this a fantasy claim. The Central American migration phenomenon to the United States is driven by a mix of factors, including rampant gang violence and poverty in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Mexico has deported people from those countries more than 2 million times since 2001 and its numbers for apprehensions and deportations rival those of the United States. Migrants have a right under international law to petition any country for asylum, including the United States. The Mexican government is not actively behind any human trafficking or drug smuggling to the United States. Instead, the high demand for drugs in the United States and lax government control over northern Mexico facilitates the drug trade.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
