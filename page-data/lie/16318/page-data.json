The CPI for prescription drugs in 2018 fell for the first time in 46 years. But that’s only when measuring calendar years from January to December, which is somewhat arbitrary. The president’s record shrinks to 5 1/2 years when measuring non-calendar years. (The CPI had last declined in the 12-month period ended July 2013.) Experts say the CPI for prescription drugs fails to account for rebates, which can be substantial, and may be giving a skewed picture because of recent market shifts toward generics and electronic payments by third parties. A range of studies we found shows drug prices have not declined, especially when it comes to branded drugs. On the other hand, the 2 percent decline for the year ended June 30 is the largest on record for any 12-month period in the CPI data, which goes back to 1970.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"27650, 27750, 27527, 23514, 21054, 22922, 21847, 22821, 21043, 21774, 22750, 21038, 21034, 21719, 22622, 18065, 17917, 17334, 17272, 16474, 16318, 16007, 14825, 15679, 14679, 15110, 13016, 13639, 13723, 12923, 13098, 12439, 11613, 12136, 12115, 11997, 11806, 11736","repeated_count":"38","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
