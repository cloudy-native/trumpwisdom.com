This is true even though Mueller denied it!”","analysis":"The Mueller report quotes Trump aides as privately telling Trump it was silly — and Mueller insisted in a congressional hearing he was not interviewed for the FBI job, which he has already held for 12 years. Instead, he said he came to the White House to discuss the role of the FBI director. “It was about the job and not about me applying for the job,” Mueller said. His statement was made under oath. Former White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon told investigators the purpose of the meeting was not a job interview but to have Mueller “offer a perspective on the institution of the FBI,” according to the special counsel’s report, and “although the White House thought about beseeching Mueller to become Director again, he did not come in looking for the job.” The Washington Post has reported that when the issue came up of whether Mueller might be interested in once again becoming FBI director, he said he could not take the job unless a law was changed. Mueller has already served a full ten-year term as FBI director and Congress in July 2011 passed legislation allowing Mueller to serve an additional two years.\n\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25098, 22333, 19759, 17186, 12985, 13610, 13114, 11345, 12137, 11864, 11188, 10741, 9086, 11034","repeated_count":"14","date":"10/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
