So in the end, they're probably wasting more water than if they did it once. So do you notice -- the people that make the machines, you know what I'm talking about. We now have the water that you need -- instead of stupid, where you have much less water than you need, and you just keep going over and over again. I had people say they'd press the button five times. They didn't have enough water....when you actually go into a new home and pay a lot of money, you turn on the faucet, and water actually comes out. Isn't that nice? That was a regulation that was put in by a lot of people that don't understand life. Because you end up using the same amount of water; you just let it run three times longer. It's crazy.”","analysis":"Think hard about this claim.
