The report quoted both men as saying they engaged in \"small talk\" and it noted \"there is nothing illegal or technically improper about a congressman meeting, intentionally or unintentionally, with a witness in an investigation.\" Trump is wrong to claim that Simpson or Fusion GPS wrote the dossier.
