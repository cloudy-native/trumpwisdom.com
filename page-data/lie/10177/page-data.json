I went down to El Paso. We did a tremendous rally, I guess we had 35,000 people between inside and out, at least. And he [Beto O'Rourke] had 502 people, and the press said, they both had big rallies. They both had big rallies. I said, wait a minute, one has close to 40,000 people, one has 500 people, and they were very much comparing them.”","analysis":"Trump often exaggerates his crowd sizes. This is a prime example. The venue for this Trump rally in El Paso holds 6,500 people. Trump claimed his campaign got permission from the local fire department to accommodate 10,000 attendees. El Paso's fire chief <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2019/02/11/el-paso-fire-officials-say-trump-crowd-estimate-permission-not-true/2844091002/\">denied that</a> and said the venue was at capacity, with nearly 6,500 attendees. The chief added that it might have been 10,000 total with the overflow crowd outside. That's still a far cry from 35,000, as Trump later began to claim. Meanwhile, an O'Rourke event organizer, citing law enforcement, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/11/trump-beto-orourke-el-paso-border-wall-1163893\">said</a> his rally drew 8,000. O'Rourke is from El Paso.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"13769, 10872, 10177, 8795, 8677, 8678, 8697, 8712","repeated_count":"8","date":"04/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
