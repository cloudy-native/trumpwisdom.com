There have been nearly 4.9 million <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001?output_view=net_1mth\">jobs created</a> and about 436,000 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/lns14000000\">manufacturing jobs</a> in his term. There has been steady growth in jobs since the Great Recession, though manufacturing job growth had stalled in the year before Trump's election. Moreover, despite the recent gains, the number of manufacturing jobs is still nearly 1 million below the level at the start of the Great Recession in December 2007.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"29055, 28744, 25687, 25495, 26587, 26013, 23996, 21309, 18856, 16732, 16704, 16337, 12749, 12689, 12324, 11644, 11207, 10859, 10236, 9867, 9696, 9510, 9423, 9183, 9108, 8950, 8719, 8608, 7364, 7395, 6786, 6935, 6968, 7124, 6824, 6911, 6606, 6763, 7055, 6573, 6307, 6016, 6393, 6461, 5905, 5415, 5600, 5345, 5364, 5316, 5524, 5821, 5841, 5221, 5768, 5124, 5370, 5019, 4790, 4906, 4945","repeated_count":"61","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
