And it was very, very close, even though they did.”","analysis":"This is another fantasy that has been repeatedly debunked. The New Hampshire attorney general’s office investigated this claim after complaints of out-of-state busing in 2014 and found no evidence that out-of-state voters were ever bused into the state to shift the outcome. Instead, some colleges in the state had hired out-of-state buses to help ferry college students to the polls. In other words, the bus company might have been from Vermont, but not the voters on the bus. After the state asked that in-state buses be used, there were no complaints in 2016 — except from the Trump White House after the president narrowly lost the state to Clinton.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
