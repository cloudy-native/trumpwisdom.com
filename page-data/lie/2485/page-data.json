Not a half a million dollars, not 12 cents.  We lost $800 billion a year on trade.  Not going to happen. ”","analysis":"The U.S. trade deficit in 2017 was $566 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Trump gets his $800 billion number by looking only at the deficit for trade in goods ($810 billion) even though U.S. trade in services runs a substantial surplus of $244 billion. Moreover, countries do not “lose” money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Canadian or Chinese goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce American purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would “gain” money that had been lost. Meanwhile, trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as the relative strength of currencies, economic growth rates, and savings and investment rates.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"15701, 11707, 10631, 10559, 10384, 9873, 9675, 9311, 9106, 8999, 8890, 8368, 7320, 7305, 7394, 6583, 6220, 6019, 6117, 5444, 5254, 5726, 4510, 4607, 4674, 3718, 3657, 3674, 3576, 4027, 3400, 3363, 3661, 3325, 3215, 2588, 2543, 2478, 2493, 2500, 2485, 2469, 2468, 1736, 1646, 1591, 0359, 0264, 0237","repeated_count":"49","date":"03/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
