But the House and Senate GOP plans backed by Trump likely would have resulted in higher costs for people with pre-existing conditions in some states, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Trump administration also refused to defend the Affordable Care Act against a lawsuit that would end protection for pre-existing conditions, putting the entire law at risk, and later asked the Supreme Court to strike down the entire act, actively seeking to end the guarantee for patients with pre-existing conditions. The Trump administration, meanwhile, has issued new rules that promote the use of low-quality short-term plans that were prohibited under the ACA. These plans typically don't have the same protections for people with existing health conditions, allowing insurance companies to deny coverage or charge higher prices.
