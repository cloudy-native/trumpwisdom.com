There are 506,305 registered voters in the city. This falsehood is based on a ridiculous misunderstanding: An <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.gand.283580/gov.uscourts.gand.283580.7.1_2.pdf\">affidavit</a> filed in a Georgia case that made this claim mixed up two states that started with “Mi.” The precincts were not in Wayne County, Michigan, but in some of the reddest parts of Minnesota — Trump country. Our colleague Aaron Blake further <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/20/trump-campaigns-much-hyped-affidavit-features-big-glaring-error/\">dug into the data</a> and found that even in those Minnesota precincts, the data in the affidavit was off. Minnesota has same-day registration and very high turnout rates. Blake determined that the number of voters matched the number of votes cast. He speculated that the affidavit might have been relying upon incomplete “estimated voters” data from the Minnesota secretary of state in the days after the election. Trump's allies also tried to blame the \"overvote\" problem on Dominion voting machines but the counties in Minnesota in question did not use Dominion machines. This is a prime example of the incompetence of the president’s legal team. But it's repeated mishaps and failures apparently have not yet reached the president’s ears.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31387, 31128, 31520, 31068, 30964, 30812, 30850, 31451, 31426, 30723, 30681, 30672, 30673","repeated_count":"13","date":"11/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
