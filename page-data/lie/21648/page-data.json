Portland was totally out of control. The Democrats -- the liberal Democrats running the place had no idea what they were doing. They were ripping down -- for 51 days, ripping down that city, destroying the city, looting it. The level of corruption and what was going on there is incredible.”","analysis":"Protests in Portland in the weeks following the death of George Floyd in police custody continued long after most protests around the country had died down. The president often tells a story of federal agents sweeping in to forcibly stop the protests sometime after the 50th day, July 18, but federal forces were already in the city  — and had been for some time. \n\nFederal officials took a more obvious, aggressive stance toward protesters by July 1, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. They made 98 arrests during the month of July and filed federal charges in at least 75 of those cases, according to data from the U.S. attorney’s office in Oregon. Of those, the vast majority were for misdemeanors. \n\nStill, it is important to keep in mind that the more aggressive tactics — including detaining protesters in unmarked vehicles and use of less lethal munitions — employed by federal forces reanimated the protests, drawing hundreds more people each night. \n\nPortland Mayor Ted Wheeler explained the impact of federal presence simply, “As we were starting to see things de-escalate, their actions [federal forces] last Saturday night and every night since have actually ratcheted up the tension on our streets.” In other words, federal forces did the opposite of quelling protests.
