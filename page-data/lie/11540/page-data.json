Yeah. There he is. He said, 'Sir, thank you for saving our country.' I said, 'Thank you very much.' And, you know, I said, 'Thank you very much.' And I looked at Charlie and I said, \"Charlie do you have any idea how many people say that?\" I gave the commencement address at the Air Force Academy recently, and at Annapolis the year before. And they said, 'Sir, would you like to shake the hands of all the cadets?' I said, 'How many are there?' 'One thousand one hundred.' I said, 'Yeah, that sounds okay.' I say, 'Do other Presidents do it?' 'Yes, they do.' 'Do all of them?' 'Yeah, they do.' What they didn't say is they start and then they peter out and they go back. Because it's -- it's tough. It was really hot. That sun was beaming down. And I'm just one hand. And some of these guys are great athletes. And some of the women -- they had some women in the class that were -- their hands were very strong, okay? And they're all shaking. And, you know, they're a little nervous, maybe; they're meeting the President. They're shaking strongly and -- 'Sir.' But, you know, with shaking 1,100 hands and saluting. We're saluting, shaking, turning, spinning. They're coming at all different directions. I felt like a great fighter pilot. But I stood up there for the whole thing. I said, 'There's no way that other Presidents have done that.' He said, 'No, no, they do it but they leave after about 50 or 60 people.' I said, 'Why didn't you tell me that?' But I'm glad I did it. But I did the same thing -- I did the same thing at Annapolis the year before.”","analysis":"This story is a fantasy, as often happens when the president cites a person supposedly calling him \"Sir.\".
