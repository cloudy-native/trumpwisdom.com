U.S. policy is to detain adults who are apprehended crossing the border illegally. Children and some adults in some cases are eligible for asylum or legal residence, and there's a vetting process to adjudicate their claims. The U.S. has around 350 immigration judges. There's no evidence that anyone is asking for thousands more. Trump says U.S. immigration laws are weak, but they are comparatively tough and it's the same system used by many countries. The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for tighter border controls, found in a 2017 report that “over the past 20 years, 37 percent of all aliens free pending their trials — 918,098 out of 2,498,375 — never showed for court.” That means 63 percent did show up.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/17/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
