You're going to triple your taxes and it won't be enough. And it will be lousy health care. You'll end up waiting for five weeks to see a doctor.”","analysis":"O'Rourke does support some form of universal health care coverage, but the doom and gloom that Trump presents as the consequences is overblown. Obviously, a transition to single-payer health care would lead to upheaval and uncertainty since it would encompass the entire health care system, not just the small piece covered by Obamacare. But other countries appear to manage with single-payer systems, at lower costs than the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"9282, 6369, 5923, 5892, 6071, 5566, 5619","repeated_count":"7","date":"10/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
