She's a third-rate reporter. New York Times. And we put her name up here last week. You saw that. People thought it was a commercial. It wasn't a commercial. It was like a commercial, but it wasn't a commercial. It was just clips. And because we exposed her as being a bad reporter, what happened is she came out and said Mark Meadows was crying. And they made it sound -- I said, Mark -- and it's okay if he did. I wouldn't -- you know, look. But I think he was crying probably -- really, for the wrong reason they had it down. But he's not a crier. And if he was -- I know criers. I could tell you people that you know that are very famous. They cry, and that's okay too. But it was a nasty story in so many ways. It was fake news. And she only did it because we exposed her for being a terrible, dishonest reporter. She is. I've known her for a long while. I haven't spoken to her in a long time. I made the mistake: I take a picture with her at the desk, a long time ago. Every time she does a story, if I say -- I haven't spoken to her in long -- many, many, many months, maybe years. I don't speak to her.”","analysis":"Although Trump criticizes Haberman in this diatribe, at its core he is confirming her reporting that chief of staff Mark Meadows cried in meetings after taking the job.
