John McCain's vote was the only impediment to passing a repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. But none of the substantive replacement bills got nearly enough votes, and McCain's vote was against a \"skinny\" repeal that was only to lead to talks with the House on a common position, with no guarantee of an agreement that would pass both Houses. McCain had earlier voted for a version of repealing the ACA, but he objected to the skinny repeal because the process went against legislative tradition.
