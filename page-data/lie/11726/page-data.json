So the wineries come to me and they say -- the California guys, they come to me: Sir, we are paying a lot of money to put our products into France and you're letting -- meaning, this country is allowing this French wine which is great, we have great wine, too, allowing it to come in for nothing.”","analysis":"The EU, not France, sets wine duties for all member countries. International trade works in such a way that some countries dominate some markets and don't compete as much in others. The French have trade restrictions on U.S. wine, just as the U.S. has trade restrictions on French clothing.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"25726, 16736, 16772, 16784, 14654, 15813, 15690, 14002, 12940, 13283, 12517, 12428, 11198, 11561, 11462, 11467, 11248, 11838, 11726, 10481, 10358, 10252, 10034, 9657, 9429, 8996, 9001, 7832, 7326, 7417, 7489, 6574, 6295, 6192, 6116, 6319, 6083, 5293, 5824, 5252, 5671, 5641, 4585, 3687, 3675, 3876, 4189, 4190, 3806, 4211, 4218, 3644, 3650, 3739, 4120, 4085, 3601, 3839, 4048, 4060, 3442, 3572, 3991, 3914, 3401, 3361, 3294, 3334, 3221, 3001, 2952, 2717, 2674, 2758, 2759, 2793, 2615, 2495, 2484, 2470, 2359","repeated_count":"81","date":"06/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
