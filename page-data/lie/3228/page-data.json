Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam.”","analysis":"These tweets are replete with suspect claims. Trump is referring to the team of lawyers that special counsel Robert Mueller has assembled. Eleven out of 16 attorneys on Mueller's team made public so far have contributed to Democrats, including Clinton and Obama. The other five have no record of political contributions, though the Daily Caller says 13 are registered Democrats. One attorney who donated the maximum amount represented the Clinton Foundation in a 2015 lawsuit. Another attorney without a record of political donations represented a Clinton aide at one point. Both attorneys worked for WilmerHale, a firm that also represents Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, as well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Moreover, Mueller is a registered Republican, and under federal law, he is not allowed to consider the political leanings of his staff when hiring them. The investigation continues and no conclusions have been announced as to any collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia, nor as to obstruction of justice. Mueller's investigation has not cost $20 million. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1015746/download\">Official</a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1067341/download\">reports</a> show the special counsel's investigation has incurred $7.7 million in direct costs (rent, salaries, supplies and the like) through March 2018, and another $9 million in indirect costs that the Department of Justice says it \"would have incurred for the investigations irrespective of the existence of the SCO [special counsel's office].\" Mueller is not legally authorized to investigate the 33,000 emails that went missing from Clinton's private email server in 2016. Trump insinuates that Clinton should be investigated for collecting $145 million as secretary of state. This is a reference to the \"Uranium One\" deal, a sale of uranium from the United States to a foreign company. The suggestion is that Clinton approved this uranium sale in exchange for a $145 million contribution to the Clinton Foundation. But it was not up to Clinton alone to approve the Uranium One deal, but to nine different cabinet members including her. The New York Times reported that Clinton may not have participated in the discussions. Also, $131.3 million of the money was donated to the Clinton Foundation by Uranium One's founder, who had divested from the firm three years before the deal, and a year and a half before Clinton became secretary of state. The Times reported that a Canadian investor in Uranium One contributed $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation around the time of the deal, while Clinton was secretary of state. Andrew McCabe, the former acting FBI director whom Trump fired, became part of the investigation of Clinton’s emails long after his wife, Jill McCabe, unsuccessfully ran for a Virginia state Senate seat. The political action committee of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) gave $452,500 to McCabe, and the state Democratic Party gave her campaign an additional $207,788. That was about one-third of the $1.8 million budget for her campaign. McAuliffe is close to Clinton, but there is no evidence she knew of the contributions. Moreover, it stretches the imagination that McAuliffe would know that the husband of someone he was supporting in a Virginia legislative race was going to be promoted months later to a position of authority in the email case.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"31168, 31089, 30796, 30775, 29791, 29861, 30256, 30452, 30458, 27105, 24027, 23834, 23338, 23567, 22337, 22944, 21707, 22743, 21740, 22665, 21666, 21639, 21172, 20486, 20508, 19845, 20335, 19344, 19786, 19757, 19770, 18985, 18871, 19429, 18963, 19713, 19648, 19606, 19609, 19315, 19565, 19545, 19540, 19482, 18573, 17559, 17108, 16966, 17433, 17470, 17180, 16618, 16685, 16582, 16461, 16305, 15975, 16018, 15225, 15407, 14579, 15775, 14916, 14830, 15729, 15364, 15365, 15565, 14964, 15480, 15491, 14299, 14356, 14373, 14028, 14612, 13928, 15076, 13765, 13790, 13844, 12399, 13135, 13189, 13499, 13710, 12994, 12973, 12361, 11179, 11693, 11051, 11667, 11648, 11655, 11347, 12150, 12083, 12120, 11325, 12015, 12004, 11310, 11305, 11267, 11294, 11161, 11168, 11771, 11762, 11086, 11099, 11732, 10920, 10804, 10652, 10563, 10564, 10575, 10936, 10362, 10364, 10369, 10329, 10347, 10348, 10077, 9689, 9917, 9741, 9742, 9782, 9624, 9595, 9485, 9618, 9621, 9424, 9442, 9313, 9278, 9238, 9174, 9200, 9201, 9204, 9267, 8931, 9082, 9037, 8880, 8899, 8649, 8469, 8400, 8348, 8507, 8017, 8141, 7711, 7282, 7621, 7549, 7428, 7548, 7588, 6582, 6624, 6627, 6632, 6540, 7494, 7498, 7210, 7212, 7005, 7449, 7450, 7457, 6683, 5940, 5948, 6102, 6073, 5394, 5717, 5718, 5184, 5655, 5044, 5650, 5651, 5041, 5968, 4777, 4986, 4758, 4683, 4508, 4459, 4489, 4491, 4493, 4577, 4625, 4480, 4481, 4475, 4478, 4381, 4345, 4466, 4468, 4338, 4283, 4332, 4275, 4529, 3878, 3788, 3802, 3784, 3785, 3790, 4219, 4184, 4185, 4138, 4088, 4089, 4071, 4035, 4036, 3427, 3818, 3423, 3504, 3327, 3176, 3243, 3179, 3229, 3232, 3222, 3226, 3227, 3228, 3209, 2813, 0363","repeated_count":"250","date":"05/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
