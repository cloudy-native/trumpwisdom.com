They should do that race over, by the way. I think her opponent is right when he is having fits about that race. When you look at the ballot, the ballots that are missing and the ballot frauds, nobody knows what's going on with that race and yet they declared her a winner. So I don't know what's happened over the last 24 hours, but her opponent is rightfully going a little bit crazy.”","analysis":"Results were delayed for several weeks in a New York congressional primary, with Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) eventually declared the winner. Trump falsely suggested fraud was afoot, when no such allegation has been leveled. “Let’s be clear, the issue in my race was disenfranchisement, not voter fraud. More than 1 in 5 ballots were discarded, many multiples of the final margin,” Suraj Patel, Maloney’s opponent, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/surajpatelnyc/status/1311135111644155909\">wrote on Twitter</a>. “We called our election a canary in the coal mine for November, we were right.
