In one case, the widow of a deceased man had cast her ballot with a “Mrs.” prefix before her husband’s name, a style that largely went out of fashion in the 1970s. In another case, a dead person did not vote but someone with a very similar name had voted legally. Other alleged cases of dead voters also did not pan out. An investigation by Georgia state election officials found only two possible cases, despite Trump's claims of more than 5,000 dead people voting in the state. “That handful of instances are consistent with what we see in every election,\" Georgia secretary of state counsel Ryan Germany said.
