So I think I'm at 51 percent with Rasmussen. But think of it. It's incredible that I'm at 51 percent.”","analysis":"Trump often cites tracking polls by Rasmussen, which consistently has a Republican-leaning bias. But it had a 50 percent approval rating for Trump, while most other polls were well below that. The polling gurus at {FiveThirtyEight} say that an adjusted rating would have shown Trump at 44 percent in the poll. On the day of the tweet, Trump had an average approval of 42.3 percent in 538's blended poll rating, along with 52.9 percent disapproval.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"28021, 28137, 28281, 27049, 24988, 25134, 24708, 24589, 24162, 22040, 21007, 21543, 22136, 21343, 21760, 21383, 21375, 17861, 16957, 16988, 16602, 16060, 15896, 15017, 15761, 15627, 14218, 13760, 13196, 12807, 12813, 12924, 11473, 11148, 11008, 10315, 10124, 9914, 9664, 9480, 9307, 8913, 8812, 8858, 8676, 8683, 8708, 8606, 7267, 7545, 7006, 5561, 5317, 4738, 2726, 2685, 2625, 2281, 1870, 1492, 0662, 0667, 0665, 0087","repeated_count":"64","date":"06/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
