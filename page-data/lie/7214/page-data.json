Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC? They still don't have it. Check out how biased Facebook, Google and Twitter are in favor of the Democrats. That’s the real Collusion!”","analysis":"There was no collusion between Russia and the Democrats. The dossier commissioned by Fusion GPS for Democrats contained salacious elements and many details turned out to be incorrect or unproven. Fusion has said the former British spy who wrote it received $168,000. The FBI was sufficiently impressed that it considered pay him for additional research. The Fact Checker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/24/what-steele-dossier-said-vs-what-mueller-report-said/\">compared the Steele memos</a> with the findings of the Mueller report and found several areas of overlap as well as major sections that remain unconfirmed and in doubt. Plus, the FBI and the Democratic National Committee disagree on whether the FBI requested access to the DNC's servers. FBI Director James Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee that the bureau made \"multiple requests at different levels\" to access DNC's servers, but the DNC said the FBI never requested access. The DNC ultimately allowed a private company to review its database and share findings with the FBI. And there's no evidence that Twitter, Google or Facebook are intentionally biased against Trump.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"19719, 16119, 13889, 14907, 14176, 13993, 11191, 10142, 7214, 4612, 4198, 3789, 3636, 4090, 3224, 2935, 2777, 1584, 1019, 0766, 0763, 7222, 0554, 0504, 13891, 0206","repeated_count":"26","date":"11/15/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
