They never mentioned the crowds, it’s sort of amazing. You know what? I don't think we've ever had an empty seat from the time I came down the escalator — that’s a long time ago. I don't think we've ever had an empty seat. Now, what the crooked media does, though, if you got like over here — look how packed it is and it’s thousands outside ... but here’s the thing, if this man and that beautiful woman happened to get up because they want to go to the bathroom, those cameras will turn to those two seats and they'll say, ‘Trump wasn't able to fill up the arena.’ ... Nobody ever leaves our speeches because is there a better place to be in the world than a Trump rally? Never. Nobody.”","analysis":"This claim is as ridiculous as it is old. People leave Trump rallies. It happens. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/19/president-trumps-crowd-size-estimates-increasingly-unbelievable/?tid=lk_inline_manual_128\">The evidence abounds</a>. They're human and these events are long. They start late. The story about cameras filming the empty seats of attendees who went to the restroom is bunk. Trump often complains that news reports don't mention his crowd sizes, but they do. Often it’s necessary to do so because Trump is way off the mark and requires a fact check.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
