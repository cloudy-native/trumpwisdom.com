The president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) — a union that represents about 700,000 government workers — said union members \"unequivocally oppose using shutdowns as a means of resolving policy disputes.\" Two days later, Trump claimed most of the workers who were furloughed were Democrats -- again without evidence.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/25/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
