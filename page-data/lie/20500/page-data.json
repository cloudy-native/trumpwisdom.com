Why does Germany show fewer coronavirus cases? Because it flattened the curve early in the outbreak, stopping the spread of the disease. Trump and U.S. political leaders, on the other hand, gave lax and inconsistent guidance, which facilitated the disease's spread. Trump pushed states to reopen their businesses; many did, and as a result covid-19 cases began to spike.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
