We don’t want the money to go into the pockets. I have a list here where it talks about the insurance companies. … Anthem, big company, from the beginning of Obamacare, 270 percent increase in their stock price. Humana, 420 percent up. Aetna, 470 percent increase from Obamacare. Cigna, 480 percent increase since Obamacare. The insurance companies have absolutely taken advantage of this country and our people. And I stopped it by stopping the CSRs.”","analysis":"This claim is false. Insurance companies have actually lost billions in the Obamacare exchanges, according to company filings and industry analysts. For example, Aetna is on pace to lose $750 million from its participation in the exchanges — $100 million in 2014, $150 million in 2015, $300 million in 2016 and more than $200 million in 2017. As a result, it is not participating in 2018, a spokesman said. Humana announced it would leave the exchanges, saying it was too risky after losing $45 million in the individual market in 2017. The CRSs -- cost-savings reductions -- simply reimburse companies for money they were already required under law to spend.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"1372, 1425, 1370, 1373, 1403, 1404, 1438, 1371, 1470","repeated_count":"9","date":"10/17/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
