So we’re going to have to get much, much tougher in terms of penalty. And if you want to stop it — if you look at certain countries where they have, as an example, the death penalty, and say, 'How’s your drug problem?' And they will tell you, 'We don’t have much of a drug problem.'”","analysis":"Trump's argument largely fails to hold water. Of 33 countries and territories that impose death sentences for drug offenses, only seven do so with regularity, according to Harm Reduction International. Five of those -- China, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia and Vietnam -- all have significant problems with drug production or trafficking, despite their use of capital punishment for these crimes. The other two are Saudi Arabia and Singapore, which have modest or no drug problems. But Singapore is a small country and it's not comparable to the United States.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"8988, 8878, 8831, 2850","repeated_count":"4","date":"03/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
