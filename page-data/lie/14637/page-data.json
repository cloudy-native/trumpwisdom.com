It wasn't even fair. And they said, sir, thank you for being so generous on the hurricane. They made a fortune. You made a fortune on the hurricane. Thank you for being so generous, sir. Sir, we want one more small request, just a small -- it's not much and we appreciate you listening to us. We want to build a dam in the ocean, so that if we ever have another hurricane, sir, the water won't be able to come in to where it used to, in all of the areas that it came into, sir. Do you think we could do it and I said how much? It's only $10 billion -- $10 billion? Right, Ted? Right? $10 billion they wanted, and you know the way they sell it, and it's so good, they're salesmen, they're incredible salesmen.”","analysis":"Trump is mixing together a few different pieces of the same story. The Houston Chronicle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Trump-says-Texas-made-a-fortune-on-14544214.php\">reported</a>, “Since Hurricane Ike hit Texas in 2008, state and federal officials have been studying the idea of a 70-mile coastal barrier aimed at protecting Houston’s shipping channel from hurricanes. Often called the Ike Dike, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has estimated it could cost up to $31 billion to build.” But there’s a difference between that study and accomplishing a barrier. In Feb. 2018, Congress sent Texas $4 billion for disaster mitigation, not $10 billion.
