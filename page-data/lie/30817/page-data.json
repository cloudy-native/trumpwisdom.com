'I'm sorry,' they were told. 'I'm sorry. You've already voted by mail-in ballot. Congratulations. We received a ballot, so you can no longer vote.' They didn't know what to do. They had no one to complain to. Most just left and said, 'That's strange.' But many people complained and complained vehemently. And in a lot of cases, they filled out a provisional ballot, which was almost never used but in virtually every case was a vote for Trump....this happened tens of thousands of times all over the country. That's how desperate the Democrats were.”","analysis":"This has been a persistent claim by the Trump campaign in various states — that Trump supporters went to vote, only to find their ballot had already been cast (presumably by Democratic operatives) and thus they were given a provisional ballot. But this is another fairy tale. No evidence has ever emerged to prove this. Trump’s chief lawyer, former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, for instance suggested that 17,000 provisional ballots were cast in Pittsburgh because Democrats had already cast fraudulent ballots on behalf of someone who unexpectedly turned up to vote.

And in Georgia, “there have no reports of anyone being turned away on Election Day,” Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/NorahODonnell/status/1346219556935786496\">told CBS Evening News</a>, noting the situation described by Trump surely would have been reported. (Obviously, the problem can exist and appears to result from clerical errors. There is no evidence it occurs in great numbers, is intentional, or disadvantages one party more than then the other.)","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31117, 30817, 30795, 30762, 31413, 30716","repeated_count":"6","date":"12/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
