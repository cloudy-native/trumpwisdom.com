There have been about 4.9 million jobs created since January 2017, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES0000000001?output_view=net_1mth\">according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. Job growth under Trump in the first two years was little different than Obama's last two years. As for the 60,000 oil and gas pipeline construction jobs, it's not clear how Trump gets to that number. He previously claimed 48,000 jobs were being created by the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, but only 90 of these jobs would be permanent, according to estimates from the State Department and the Brookings Institution.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"20987, 22545, 17999, 18471, 16970, 17510, 14040, 15099, 10992, 10461, 10015, 9940, 9941, 9379, 7176, 6362, 5846, 4783, 4378, 4306, 4161, 2738, 2405, 2330, 2191, 2132, 1860, 1603, 1574, 1262, 1259, 1211, 1124, 0783, 0834, 0741, 0691, 0627, 0484, 0354, 0327, 0180, 0151, 0115, 0094, 0018","repeated_count":"46","date":"04/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
