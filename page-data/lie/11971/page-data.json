Phil Murphy, a Democrat, unsuccessfully attempted to raise the top tax rate on those earning above $1 million. In fact, a similar tax increase in the 2000s did not cause wealthy residents to leave New Jersey, according to a study by researchers at Stanford University. New Jersey Treasury Department data shows the state had more millionaire tax filers after that tax increase.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
