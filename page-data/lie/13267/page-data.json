You know, they've lost 3 million jobs. It'll soon be much more than 3 million jobs. Their chain is breaking. A chain is breaking up like nobody has seen before. And once that happens, it's very hard to put it back together. You understand.”","analysis":"It’s a mystery where Trump gets this number, which seems to grow or shrink with each telling, or is simply \"millions and millions.\" “I know of no reliable evidence that indicates that China has lost 3 million jobs because of the trade war,” Robert Daly, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center’s Kissinger Institute on China and the United States, wrote in an email. “China had embarked on a historic restructuring of its economy before the trade war began. Before Trump’s election, Beijing had committed to slower, more sustainable growth based on domestic consumption, stronger service industries, and moving up the manufacturing value chain from assembly work to high tech. A reduction in the manufacturing labor force (let’s say it is 3 million jobs) must therefore be measured against job growth in China’s tech and service sectors.” Nicholas R. Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says Trump’s claim of millions of Chinese job losses is “delusional.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"14099, 13574, 13555, 13500, 13349, 12745, 12677, 12722, 13141, 12620, 13252, 13267, 12515, 12451","repeated_count":"14","date":"08/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
