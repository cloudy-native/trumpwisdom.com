And they said President Trump built it and how horrible it was. And they still talk about it, even though they know it's not true. … But, no, that was built in 2014, and I never forgot it. Somehow, I never forgot it.”","analysis":"A total perversion of what happened. When the Trump administration was separating migrant families at the southern border in 2018, part of the coverage focused on the caged enclosures where children and families were being detained. The New York Times did not claim that Trump built the cages, but Trump repeatedly sought to deflect criticism over his separation policy by noting that the Obama administration used cage enclosures to hold migrants before he did. The Obama administration never separated families systematically like Trump.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
