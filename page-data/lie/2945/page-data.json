They wouldn't be there except for the United States. They wouldn't last a week. We are protecting them. They have to now step up and pay for what is happening.”","analysis":"Trump's remarks are problematic, to say the least, and sparked outrage in the Middle East. While he does not identify the countries, many U.S. allies have vast oil wealth and fairly robust militaries. As of 2017, the United States had 15,000 in Kuwait, 10,000 troops in Qatar, 7,000 in Bahrain (where the 5th fleet is based), 5,000 each in Iraq and United Arab Emirates, 1,500 in Jordan and 200 in Oman. Allies cover 60 percent of the United States’ basing costs, worth $658 million annually.
