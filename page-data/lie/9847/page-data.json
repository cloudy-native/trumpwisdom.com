The regime rules through fear and intimidation and is mainly concerned with its own preservation, not the economic health of its people. Trump used to make this point himself. On Nov. 7, 2017, speaking in South Korea, he said, \"Citizens spy on fellow citizens, their homes are subject to search at any time, and their every action is subject to surveillance. In place of a vibrant society, the people of North Korea are bombarded by state propaganda practically every waking hour of the day. North Korea is a country ruled as a cult.\" The United Nations, in a 2014 report detailing “systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations,” described the country as a ruthless police state where as many as 120,000 people are kept in political gulags under horrific conditions; other prisons, effectively labor camps, hold people for ordinary crimes. Telephone calls are monitored, and citizens are punished for watching or listening to foreign broadcasts.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"15228, 13217, 13144, 13088, 12263, 11699, 11027, 10724, 10319, 9852, 9847, 9034, 8911, 8645","repeated_count":"14","date":"04/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
