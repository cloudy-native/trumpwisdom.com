I have a right to hire and fire ambassadors, and that's a very important thing. But even if you look at the conversation I had with the president, he didn't like her -- because in there, he didn't like her.”","analysis":"Trump has it backwards. He criticized ousted Ambassador Marie ­Yovanovitch first, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, seemingly under pressure, said he agreed, according to a rough transcript of the July 25 conversation released by the White House. “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that,” Trump says. This came seemingly out of the blue. It was in the middle of two requests Trump made of Zelensky that are being investigated as part of the House impeachment inquiry. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate a conspiracy theory involving a Democratic server, Ukraine and the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike; then he threw in the criticism of Yovanovitch; then he asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. Zelensky was inaugurated the day Yovanovitch left Ukraine for good. He replied to Trump: “It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"18211, 14851, 15250, 13901, 15034","repeated_count":"5","date":"01/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
