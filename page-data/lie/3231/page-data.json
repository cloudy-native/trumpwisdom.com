Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!”","analysis":"Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper specifically said the FBI informant who made contact with Trump campaign officials in Europe, Stefan Halper, was not spying on Trump's campaign. So far, there has been nothing to indicate whether there was a political agenda or a “spy” mandate as part of Halper's assistance to the FBI, which started after the agency opened a counterintelligence probe.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"23036, 22981, 22945, 22960, 22904, 22905, 22873, 22874, 22664, 22634, 22645, 22630, 19785, 19738, 19705, 19671, 19649, 19485, 19445, 17555, 17519, 17196, 16796, 16298, 15906, 15996, 15925, 15394, 14745, 13854, 15486, 12653, 11410, 12040, 11451, 11891, 11265, 11870, 11180, 11773, 11744, 11106, 11080, 10651, 10950, 10763, 10574, 10134, 10135, 10145, 10153, 10077, 9973, 9843, 8054, 5013, 4770, 3314, 3255, 3240, 3256, 3155, 3157, 3178, 3231, 3239, 3143, 3210","repeated_count":"68","date":"05/23/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
