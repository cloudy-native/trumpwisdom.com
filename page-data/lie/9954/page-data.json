They're sending the gang members. That's -- those are the people they're sending to the United States. … They're sending the real killers, including MS-13, because they don't want them in Honduras and El Salvador and -- they don't want the gangs, so they're sending them to our country.”","analysis":"Trump grossly mischaracterizes the Central American refugee crisis. Countries are not \"sending\" anyone; it's mostly voluntary migration. Drug cartels, smugglers, gang members and coyotes do try to game the system. But many thousands of people from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are fleeing gang violence, sexual violence, threats to their safety or high poverty.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
