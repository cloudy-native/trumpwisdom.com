According to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/who-pays-estate-tax\">nonpartisan Tax Policy Center</a>, only about 5,500 estates in 2017 — out of nearly 3 million estates — would have to pay any taxes. About half of estates subject to the tax would pay an average tax of about 9 percent. That’s because for a married couple, about $11 million is exempt from taxation. Only 80 — that’s right, 80 — taxable estates would be farms and small businesses.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"29210, 25753, 26071, 25278, 24425, 23659, 21982, 19308, 17815, 17591, 18403, 17446, 17521, 18319, 16858, 16710, 16544, 13688, 11070, 10471, 10867, 10243, 9965, 9992, 9671, 9520, 8616, 7826, 7363, 6937, 6679, 6039, 6193, 6360, 6470, 5374, 5849, 4912, 4715, 4553, 4291, 4107, 4156, 4073, 4007, 4024, 3943, 2022, 1817, 1815, 1718, 1246, 1258","repeated_count":"53","date":"09/27/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
