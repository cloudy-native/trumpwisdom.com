After the ad asserts, “President Trump tackled the virus head on as leaders should,” it follows with a clip of Fauci appearing to endorse that claim: “I can't imagine that anybody could be doing more.” But Fauci was discussing the workload of the coronavirus task force, not praising Trump. The ad angered Fauci, who issued this statement: \"In my nearly five decades of public service, I have never publicly endorsed any political candidate. The comments attributed to me without my permission in the GOP campaign ad were taken out of context from a broad statement I made months ago about the efforts of federal public health officials.” but the Trump campaign refused to take down the ad.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
