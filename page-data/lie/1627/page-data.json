It would take, as an example, to build a highway -- it would take 17 to 20 years to get approvals. And at the end of 20th year, in many cases, they voted it down. Do you approve? No. So they wasted tens of millions of dollars. There's a highway in Maryland where it took exactly 17 years. And the original numbers were very little, and it ended up costing hundreds of millions of dollars for a very small, short highway. And we can't have that.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to the Intercounty Connector, an 18.8-mile six-lane toll highway that cost $2.4 billion and was revived in 2003 and completed in 2014, though sections began opening in 2011. So that's either 8 or 11 years. There had long been controversy over the proposed highway, dating back to 1975, with opposition from local government officials, the Maryland general assembly and environmental groups. Trump is being misleading by attributing the delays to government regulations.
