The Washington Post <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/08/17/trump-eviction-moratorium/\">reported</a>, “Trump’s executive order directed some regulators to study whether an eviction moratorium was necessary and others to investigate whether they could appropriate money for rental assistance. But it fell short of reinstating the federal eviction ban that prohibited evictions of 12 million renters in government-backed properties that expired last month, as many had expected.” In other words, it does not stop evictions. Moreover, most companies have not enacted the payroll tax holiday meaning it will likely have little economic impact.
