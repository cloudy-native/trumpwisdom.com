Now we have the greatest people in the world in our military. Look at the condition, that plane looks like it's two days old, right? But it's 30 years. Can you believe it? So I said, ‘What's going on?’ ‘Well, they're negotiating with 1 and they signed a contract for $5.7 billion.”…So I said -- I met with the head of Boeing. Good man. And I said, ‘This is the first week.’ I said, ‘We're not going to buy it.’ Signed contract, all done. 5.7 billion. I said, ‘Too much money. We're not buying it.’… And we negotiated for about a month and I said to the head of Boeing, really good guy, I said ‘Hey Denis, look, uh, it's 5-7, it's got to have a three in front of it.\" …And we agreed to 3.95. Somebody said, ‘Well, that must be a totally different plane.’ Nope, in fact I actually had one generator added. It's not a big deal. One generator added, and they said to me, then Boeing came to me, so it was 3.9 as opposed to 5.7. now, that took about two months, three months, but isn't that really nice?”","analysis":"False.
