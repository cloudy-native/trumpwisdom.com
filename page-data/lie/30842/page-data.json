Voters who submitted flawed ballots in some Democrat precincts were notified and asked to fix their ballot while Republican precincts and in particular, Republican voters, were not so notified, which plainly violates the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution. If you are a Democrat, we're going to fix up your ballot, make sure it's perfect. If you are a Republican, don't even talk about it.”","analysis":"This is false -- and rejected by the courts. All counties <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/ballot-curing-in-pennsylvania/\">got the same guidance</a> the night before the election instructing them to notify political parties and update the ballot-tracking online system about ballot errors, thus allowing voters to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day. Some counties notified voters, and some didn't. But that inconsistency didn't fall strictly along partisan county lines. On Nov. 27, only days before this Trump video was released, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit rejected a Trump campaign lawsuit on this issue. Judge Stephanos Bibas, who was appointed by Trump, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www2.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/203371np.pdf\">wrote</a> the campaign’s “claims have no merit.” The complaint “never alleges that anyone treated the Trump campaign or Trump votes worse than it treated the Biden campaign or Biden votes.” Bibas added: “A violation of the Equal Protection Clause requires more than variation from county to county. It requires unequal treatment of similarly situated parties. … To be sure, counties vary in implementing that guidance, but that is normal. Reasonable county-to-county variation is not discrimination.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
