Security Council consideration of the Iranian nuclear deal will terminate and, beginning in 2026, Iran is free to conduct uranium enrichment activity using advanced centrifuges. But that does not mean Iran would be free to \"create nuclear weapons\" because it would still be bound to protocols of the International Atomic Energy Agency. Two years earlier, in 2023, Iran is committed to ratify the IAEA's Additional Protocol, which is intended to significantly increase the IAEA's ability to verify the peaceful use of all nuclear material in States with comprehensive safeguards agreements. Moreover, under the agreement, Iran said it was bound by this commitment: “Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/30/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
