You know what that is? Swifton Village. It was good and it worked out well, and it gives you confidence when things work out well at a young age, and look what happened to all of us, right?”","analysis":"Trump did spend time in Cincinnati at Swifton Village. By all accounts, at best, he did menial labor around the property and we found no evidence that he ever lived there or \"worked there\" with any regularity. There were charges of discrimination and a lawsuit during the Trumps ownership tenure. Without knowing the cost of repairs or legal expenses and the rental income, it's impossible to know if they profited on the project, but all signs suggest any profit they made was not a windfall or a great success by Trumpian standards.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"27802, 19283, 17270, 11591, 5403, 5433, 4413","repeated_count":"7","date":"08/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
