Sen. Corker was strongly opposed to the nuclear agreement with Iran reached by the United States and other major world powers. McGurk wasn't an “Obama appointee.” He was appointed as a senior aide to Afghanistan and Iraq by former President George W. Bush. The $1.8 billion payment was not related to the Iran nuclear deal; instead, it involved a settlement of a long-standing claim made by Iran on the same day four American detainees, including The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian, were released. A jumbo jet carrying $400 million in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies landed in Tehran as the detainees flew off. That money purportedly was partial payment of an outstanding claim by Iran for U.S. military equipment that was never delivered. Soon after, $1.3 billion in cash followed. State Department officials have insisted that the negotiations over the claims and detainees were not connected but came together at the same time, with the cash payment used as “leverage” to ensure the release of detainees.
