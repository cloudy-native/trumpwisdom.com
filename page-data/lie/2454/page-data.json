The unemployment rate for black Americans was 6.8 percent in December, the lowest since 1972, but it rose to 7.7 percent in January. Moreover, citing these stats is a flip-flop. During the 2016 campaign, Trump used to claim a Four-Pinocchio stat that 58 percent of African-American youth was unemployed. The official Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate for black youth at the time was 19.2 percent — about one-third of the rate used by Trump. Now that he’s president, Trump appears all too happy to cite the unemployment rate for African Americans, bragging that it’s the best since the turn of the century. We’re pleased the president is now using accurate statistics but it’s absurd to suggest, as he does to audiences, that he had anything to do with these numbers.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"17491, 17194, 17304, 17373, 17257, 17096, 14896, 14432, 15284, 15313, 15339, 13193, 12826, 12838, 12725, 12752, 12670, 12715, 12298, 12482, 11597, 11645, 11218, 12204, 12253, 11574, 11689, 11549, 12085, 11372, 12046, 11701, 12220, 12017, 11927, 11509, 11893, 11226, 11827, 11867, 11171, 11790, 11146, 11052, 10980, 10710, 10607, 10523, 10417, 10861, 10380, 10350, 10240, 10186, 10217, 10090, 10001, 10037, 9700, 9514, 9436, 9384, 9111, 9022, 9059, 8954, 8900, 8721, 8227, 7924, 7852, 7454, 7142, 7058, 6221, 6185, 6194, 6200, 6171, 6108, 6065, 6053, 5822, 5836, 5778, 5689, 4785, 4837, 4947, 4956, 4765, 4737, 4685, 4716, 4701, 4672, 4673, 4658, 4563, 4571, 4547, 4514, 4521, 4064, 3961, 2454, 2387","repeated_count":"107","date":"02/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
