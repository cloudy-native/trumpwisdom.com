(Trump promised as a candidate 4 percent annual growth.) But GDP growth has routinely topped 3 percent on a quarterly basis. GDP growth hit 3.2 percent in the first quarter of 2015 while Obama was still in office. While one quarter in 2019 topped three percent, the other three quarters had growth of about two percent.
