She's a supporter of Democrats, should have been very unfair.”","analysis":"NBC's Kristen Welker is a professional journalist who Federal Election Commission records show has never made political contributions to candidates. Welker isn't registered to vote as a Democrat, either; she is listed as having no party affiliation. Her parents's contributions are irrelevant to how she would conduct her job as debate moderator; they were also not Democratic fundraisers.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"29500, 29935, 29090, 28647, 26739, 26775, 26695, 27259, 27424, 25761","repeated_count":"10","date":"10/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
