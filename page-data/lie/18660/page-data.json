And every time they bring a package, they lose money on it.”","analysis":"The president says the U.S. Postal Service loses money on every package it delivers for e-commerce merchants. But that appears to be an analysis derived more from his gut — or his animus toward Amazon — than from any sophisticated analysis of the numbers. USPS, by its own calculation, says revenue from package deliveries far exceeds costs. With Amazon perhaps seeking to bypass USPS, the agency must be careful not to price itself out of the market — and thus face a bigger financial squeeze. Moreover, under the law, USPS is prohibited from losing money in the package-delivery sector. While the Treasury Department claims that USPS's calculations are flawed, it does not offer an alternative way of calculating profits. Indeed, internal USPS documents <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/18/trump-amazon-postal-service/\">obtained by The Washington Post</a> found that Amazon generated $3.9 billion in revenue for the agency in the 2019  fiscal year that ended in September. The Postal Service turned a $1.6 billion profit on that business, nearly twice as much as any other customer, according to one memo obtained by The Post.
