You know about that. One in Pennsylvania. It's actually a new mine. That hadn't happen in a long time folks. But we're putting the people and we're putting the miners back to work.”","analysis":"Trump takes credit for a new mine opening up, but the digging of this coal mine began two months before the presidential election. Moreover, these mines are for metallurgical coal, which is used to make steel. It's not relevant in the context of the Paris agreement, in which this claim was made, because the agreement has to do with carbon emissions from thermal coal, which produces heat and electricity.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"5283, 0739, 0689, 0658, 0645, 06340603","repeated_count":"7","date":"06/07/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
