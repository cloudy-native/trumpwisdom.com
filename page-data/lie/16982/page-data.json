And they went in, and they went into the FISA courts and they forged papers, and they did a lot of bad things.”","analysis":"The Mueller investigation was not a scam and was not started illegally. The FBI probe into contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign was not sparked by the dossier assembled by a former British spy, but sprang from a tip provided by the Australian government.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
