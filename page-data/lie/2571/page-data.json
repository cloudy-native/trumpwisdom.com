Many of them, they say 85 percent of them were criminals, and had criminal records. And the mayor of Oakland went out, and she -- she went out and warned them all. Scatter. So instead of taking in a thousand, they took in a fraction of that.”","analysis":"Trump attacked the mayor of Oakland, Calif., for tipping off residents to a raid by ICE in Northern California. Trump blamed the mayor for endangering the community, saying ICE would have captured nearly 1,000 undocumented immigrants but for the mayor's warning. ICE ended up detaining 232 individuals in this raid. But it's important to note that ICE never catches all of its targets during these types of raids, that not all of ICE's targets have a rap sheet, and that not all are violent.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"2570, 2571","repeated_count":"2","date":"03/08/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
