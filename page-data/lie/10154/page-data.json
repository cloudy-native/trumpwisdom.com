This was a coup. This wasn't stealing information from an office in the Watergate apartments. This was an attempted coup. … Why didn't they mention in the Mueller report all of the horrible things that we found out about the other side, including the fake dossier, the fake dossier which even the New York Times now says was fake, which, again, I respect that they came out and said it.”","analysis":"After special counsel Robert Mueller released his report, the New York Times published <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/us/politics/steele-dossier-mueller-report.html\">an article</a> noting that \"some of the most sensational claims in the [Steele] dossier appeared to be false, and others were impossible to prove.\" (The Fact Checker also found that Mueller's report seemed to cast \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/24/what-steele-dossier-said-vs-what-mueller-report-said/?utm_term=.f53807d26905\">grave doubt</a>\" on several parts of the dossier.) The Times article noted that the Justice Department inspector general and Attorney General William Barr have said they are looking into whether the FBI improperly relied on the dossier to make the case for investigating Trump. The dossier was not the genesis of the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Trump's campaign and Russia, though some elements later on were used as leads.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
