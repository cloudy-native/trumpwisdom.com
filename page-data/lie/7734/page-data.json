They said, 'You know, we could make it smaller. We could make it 3 percent. We could make it 2 percent. We could make it 4 percent.' I said, 'No. Make it 10 percent. Make it more than 10 percent.' Because it's been a long time. It's been more than 10 years.

Military pay <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.military.com/benefits/military-pay/charts/proposed-pay-charts.html\">will go increase 2.6 percent in 2019</a>, under a bill passed by Congress and signed by Trump. It increased 2.4 percent in 2018. Pay has increased for the military every year since 1983 but this will be the largest increase since 2010.
