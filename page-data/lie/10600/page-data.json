The United States has led the world in natural gas production since 2009. Crude oil production has been increasing rapidly since 2010, reaching record levels in August 2018, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. In September 2018, the United States passed both Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the largest global crude oil producer. It is expected to hold that position, according to predictions from the International Energy Agency.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
