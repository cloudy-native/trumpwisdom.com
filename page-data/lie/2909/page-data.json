And I don't take responsibility, but I would be very embarrassed if I had to. $7 trillion, and when we want to build Mr. President our infrastructure, everybody says that we want to be careful with our money. When we want to fix a highway or we want to build schools and lots of other things, tunnels, bridges, they say oh, let's be careful with our money. And yet we've spent $7 trillion in the Middle East and we've got nothing for it. Nothing, less than nothing, as far as I'm concerned.”","analysis":"Trump is lumping together the wars in Iraq (in the Middle East) and Afghanistan (in South Asia), which together cost about $1.6 trillion from 2001 to 2014. He is also adding in estimates of future spending, such as interest on the debt and veterans' care for the next three decades.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"24770, 24691, 24735, 24284, 20532, 20095, 20013, 18774, 18731, 19280, 19527, 19062, 18603, 19046, 17756, 17246, 14945, 15604, 14698, 14397, 14354, 14639, 13982, 14232, 13949, 15113, 13876, 12766, 13587, 12794, 13322, 11368, 12119, 11249, 11841, 10317, 10320, 9363, 9121, 8639, 8462, 7717, 5067, 3586, 3539, 3185, 3217, 2995, 2909, 2820, 2867, 2557, 2277, 2421, 2198, 2316, 2324, 2084, 1947, 1920, 1935, 1964, 1878, 1681, 1020, 1037, 0853, 0678, 0709, 0637, 0635, 0364, 0314, 0185, 0158, 0146, 0058, 0028","repeated_count":"78","date":"04/24/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
