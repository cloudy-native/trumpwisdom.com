But that number is very, very much under one percent. It's, you know, it's one- tenth of one percent. So this number would be higher. But I think that's a big positive because when this started people were talking about three, four and five percent. Now, they're seeing that and it's through the testing but they're seeing that it looks like it's substantially below. I think it's substantially below one percent, because the people don't report. The only people that report are the people that are really feeling sick. And those are the ones that unfortunately sometimes don't make it.”","analysis":"Trump initially kept making inappropriate comparisons between the coronavirus and the seasonal flu. The new coronavirus appears to have a much higher fatality rate than the seasonal flu, possibly 10 times higher, but the outbreak was too new for a firm death rate to be determined. Moreover, it’s a new virus, not yet a seasonal one, although it’s possible covid-19 will become seasonal in the future. The death toll for the seasonal flu is an estimate calculated several years later, as a measure of excess mortality, because the flu often contributes to deaths, while not being recorded as the cause of death.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"19251, 19111, 17923, 17944, 18516, 17950, 17833, 18495, 18479, 17804, 18082, 17766, 17796, 18447","repeated_count":"14","date":"03/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
