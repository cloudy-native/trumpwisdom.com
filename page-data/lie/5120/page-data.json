It would've been 25 years before it was built. ....I said, 'How much is that? I'm sorry, what's this?' \"Sir, that's the embassy in Israel.' I said, \"What is it?\" 'Sir, it's going to cost approximately $1.1 billion.' I said, whoa, we know how to build -- two friends of mine are builders right here. They hear -- they haven't spent that much in their whole life, and they built a hell of a lot of stuff....I said, 'What do you think it'll cost to renovate the building?\" He said about $190,000. I said... I said, 'What?' He said, yes....It wouldn't be built for 25 years. As opposed to $400,000 and we just opened the most beautiful embassy -- it's been open for seven months. Seven months. So we saved essentially, over $1 billion -- actually, we really saved $1.1 billion, you want to know the truth. But we saved $1.1 billion. We opened it up in four months.”","analysis":"The new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem. Costs for the permanent embassy could well surpass $400,000 when all is said and done.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"09/21/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
