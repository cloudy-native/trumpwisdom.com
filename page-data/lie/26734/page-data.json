Every year, they'd come to see me, and I'd say, 'Why do you have to come back every year?' And I got friendly with some of the heads of the colleges, and they do a great job. But every year, they had to come back looking for funding. I said, 'You should have a long term plan.' And I worked it out, and I gave them more money than they asked for. They can't believe it. I said, 'The only bad thing about me doing this is I won't, maybe, ever see you again.' I gave them a ten year funding plan. They never had that. And one of the, really good guy, I won't say who. I don't want to embarrass. But he said, 'They make us come back. We feel like beggars.' Every year, they had to come back. I took care of the funding for Historically Black Colleges and University long term. And more than they asked for. I said, 'You're going to need more than that.' And it was an honor to do it.”","analysis":"Trump regularly touts his support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), often with a lengthy, anecdotal story that appears to be invented and has little basis in reality. He's referring to bipartisan legislation, dubbed the FUTURE Act, that the Congress passed in December, 2019. The legislation extended $255 million in annual STEM funding for minority-serving colleges, including roughly $85 million specifically allocated to HBCUs. Obama had put in place <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-signs-executive-order-promoting-excellence-innovation-and-sustainab\">a ten-year programming stream</a> but Trump had let it lapse. (Trump often makes it sound as if Obama refused to do this and Trump had to come to the rescue.) Moreover, the funding for HBCUs is a congressional initiative. “Congress does all this work and presents it to him in the budget, and he can choose to sign it. This year [2019], he held off on signing some significant STEM funding, making HBCUs beg for it,” said Marybeth Gasman, a Rutgers professor and one of the leading authorities on HBCUs. “Most HBCU support is the result of Congress. Trump has promised all kinds of things to HBCUs and has followed through on little. Under Trump, the White House Initiative for HBCUs was moved to the White House and is quite quiet compared to the work under President Obama’s administration.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Education","repeated_ids":"30380, 29833, 29919, 30295, 30322, 30528, 29304, 29379, 28282, 27002, 26734, 26768, 27277, 27548, 26386, 26322, 25413, 25318, 25371, 25215, 25079, 24958, 23480, 23267, 23118, 22116, 22078, 21937, 21914, 22466, 21890, 22137, 21349, 21276, 20667, 20110, 20060, 19983, 20218, 20190, 20197, 19877, 20315, 19879, 19880, 19878","repeated_count":"46","date":"10/21/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
