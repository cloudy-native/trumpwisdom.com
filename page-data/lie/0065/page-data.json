And I just said, ‘Why?’…1,250. It could be 2,000, it could be more than that.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to the estimated 1,250 refugees and asylum-seekers that the United States, under Obama, agreed to accept from an Australian detention center. Refugees and asylum-seekers who arrive illegally by boat in Australia are called “illegal maritime arrivals.” They can apply for two types of temporary visas, and some may qualify to apply for permanent residency.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"0044","repeated_count":"1","date":"02/02/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
