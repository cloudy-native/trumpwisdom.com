Trump suggests that Zaid was threatening a coup. But Zaid <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whistleblower-attorney-coup-trump\">said</a> that was not the case: “I was referring to a completely lawful process of what President Trump would likely face as a result of stepping over the line, and that particularly whatever would happen would come about as a result of lawyers. The coup comment referred to those working inside the Administration who were already, just a week into office, standing up to him to enforce recognized rules of law.“","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25296, 25937, 25832, 20245, 19755, 19709, 19598, 19619, 18503, 14525, 15269, 15625, 15566","repeated_count":"13","date":"03/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
