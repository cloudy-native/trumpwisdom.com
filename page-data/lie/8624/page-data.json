The Trump administration is deporting hundreds of MS-13 members per year. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it deported 1,332 members of MS-13 in fiscal 2018, and another 1,000 or so in the previous year, fiscal 2017, which included part of Obama’s term.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
