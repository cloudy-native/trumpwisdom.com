He can't claim to have the biggest political crowds in U.S. history. Reagan attracted huge crowds. For instance, in 1984, a Reagan rally attracted 100,000 people to a rally in Doylestown, about two hours away from Hersey, Penna., where Trump in 2019 spoke to a crowd estimated to be about 10,000 people. Since Trump is claiming a 200-year record, it's also worth noting that the Nazi Nuremberg rallies led by Adolf Hitler attracted hundreds of thousands of people, far more than any Trump rally. (Like Trump, the Nazis lied about crowd estimates so we can discount a claim of 1 million people but the fairgrounds likely could hold 250,000 to 350,000.) Barack Obama attracted a crowd of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/barack-obama-returns-berlin-scene-iconic-2008-speech-n684066\">about 200,000 people</a> in 2008 when he gave a speech in Berlin.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"30996, 30327, 30359, 30368, 29790, 30045, 29415, 28890, 27745, 27783, 27264","repeated_count":"11","date":"10/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
