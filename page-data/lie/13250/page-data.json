They're going to other countries. And if I were them, I'd want to make a deal. But, in the meantime, the United States is taking in tremendous amounts of dollar. You know, billions and billions of dollars. And, frankly, there's been no inflation. And most of these products haven't even gone up because China is able to manipulate and also able to put cash into the system where the product can stay at the same price. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a competitive product and they wouldn't be able to sell it, and they'd lose jobs. But they lost a lot of jobs, and I think they want to see a sensible solution.”","analysis":"This is highly misleading, as there is little to no evidence supporting Trump's claim that China has lost millions of jobs due to the trade war with the United States or his claim that China is bearing the entire burden of the tariffs. Multiple economic studies have shown that American consumers are paying for the tariffs in the form of higher costs passed down from the businesses contending with the tariffs.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
