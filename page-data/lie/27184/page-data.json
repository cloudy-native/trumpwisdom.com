And we did the exact opposite the way they've been doing it for 50 years with blood all over the place, no blood in the sand, right?”","analysis":"Trump's rhetoric of \"peace without blood in the sand\" is misleading. Unlike Jordan and Egypt, the Arab and North African nations extending diplomatic recognition to Israel during his presidency have never been at war with the Jewish state. The source of much of the violence remains the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians -- an issue that Trump largely ignored. Helping win diplomatic recognition for Israel from Arab states is certainly a noteworthy achievement. But Trump also sometimes misleadingly says it came with \"no cost.\" In reality, the Trump administration made a number of deals to coax Middle Eastern and North African leaders into recognizing Israel, such as weapons sales and upending U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara region claimed by Morocco.
