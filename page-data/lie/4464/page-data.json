The South African government is considering plans to redistribute private farmland, which is owned mostly by whites, but this plan is not yet final and Trump’s protest appears to have been spurred by one test case. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Trump added an outlandish and baseless claim that South African farmers are being killed on a “large scale.” He prodded the secretary of state to investigate this myth fueled by white supremacists. He earned Four Pinocchios for that. ","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
