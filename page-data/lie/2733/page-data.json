Nine members of Mueller’s team have made political donations to Democrats, compared to seven with no record of such donations. Five of the 16 known members contributed to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. In any case, the DOJ is legally barred from discriminating career appointees based on political affiliation.
