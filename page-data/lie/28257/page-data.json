You look at -- you look at what's happened there: We were doing a trade deal, Bibi -- two trade deals -- and they were killing each other all the time for 25 years. Right? Much longer than that. I said, 'Wait a minute, we're doing trade with each country. Why don't we just settle it up so you don't have to kill each other?' And they were so happy. You know, they were so happy. So we settled the deal.”","analysis":"Trump falsely-- and bizarrely -- takes credit for ending a war between Serbia and Kosovo that ended more than two decades ago. Despite continued tensions, the two sides have not directly fought each other since 1999. Trump helped negotiate an economic normalization deal between Kosovo and Serbia, but that agreement mostly involved economic and transportation links, and it did not solve tougher geopolitical issues like Serbia’s refusal to recognize Kosovo ever since the country declared its independence in 2008.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30386, 30272, 29720, 30033, 28579, 28391, 27963, 28257","repeated_count":"8","date":"10/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
