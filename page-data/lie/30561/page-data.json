There was no reason to believe illegal votes turned the tide in Georgia’s election. On election night, Trump was ahead by more than 100,000 votes, but there were nearly 270,000 ballots to be counted, mainly from Democratic strongholds. So Trump fell behind as more votes were counted. After a recount, Biden eventually won by nearly 12,000 votes.
