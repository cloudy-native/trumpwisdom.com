A handful of studies looked at whether there is a causation between sanctuary cities and crime. They either found no statistically significant impact of sanctuary policies on crime, or a reduction in crime due to immigrant-friendly policing strategies. The vote Trump is referring to has to do with the “No Sanctuary for Criminals Act,” which would bar federal grants from sanctuary cities and allow victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants to sue those cities. Voting to allow those cities to keep federal funds is not the same as voting for \"deadly\" cities.
