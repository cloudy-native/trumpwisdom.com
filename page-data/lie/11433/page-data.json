Think of that.

But there's a big caveat: \"No attempt is made to estimate possible benefits resulting from a particular regulation, or category of regulations, or to argue that costs associated with particular regulations are (or are not) justified.\" In other words, this claim only addresses the supposed cost of regulations, not any benefits that might justify those costs.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
