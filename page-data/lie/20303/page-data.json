I've had 144 all-time highs stock markets during a 3 1/2 year period. Nobody has ever come close to that and we are going to do it again but it's going to be even stronger than last time.”","analysis":"Trump often claims that the stock market has notched record highs more than 100 times during his presidency. The stock market is doing well, but his scorekeeping is fishy. For example, on Oct. 10, 2019, he said “the stock market today just hit another all-time high,” but the Dow Jones industrial average was higher nine days earlier. According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/dow-jones-closing-history-top-highs-and-lows-since-1929-3306174\">the Balance</a>, a personal finance website, the Dow Jones had broken 44 records from the time Trump took office through Jan. 9, 2020. It is worthing noting that between Inauguration Day and Jan. 4 of the fourth year of their respective presidencies, the stock market grew 63 percent under Trump, vs. 82 percent under Obama.
