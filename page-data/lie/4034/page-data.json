So there's just one example where Apple is spending $350 billion.”","analysis":"Trump suggests that Apple's investment was entirely in response to the tax cut, which is a stretch. Apple is certainly bringing back money from overseas because the corporate tax rate was reduced, but its investment plans likely would have proceeded with or without the tax cut.
