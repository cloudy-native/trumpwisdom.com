A relatively small percentage of Iranians participate in these chants, which is mainly of symbolic use for the government. “Over the decades, I've heard ‘Death to America!’ shouted routinely at Friday prayers, and at commemorations of the U.S. Embassy takeover and other demonstrations,” a New Yorker writer <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/death-to-america-and-the-iran-deal\">reported</a> in 2015. “The regime refuses to shelve the slogan. These days, however, students are often bused in on anniversaries as crowd-filler; the perk is a day off from school. They chant when prompted. The enthusiasm is a bit like the anti-American graffiti on public walls — it hasn't been painted over, but it’s fading.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
