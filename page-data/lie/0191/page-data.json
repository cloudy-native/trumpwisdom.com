That’s something that nobody has ever heard of or thought could happen, and they’re actually doing that rather than being forced to buy insurance.”","analysis":"Trumps slips in the word \"exemption,\" which allows him to inflate the figure. Only 6.5 million taxpayers paid the so-called “shared responsibility” payments in 2015. That’s actually a decrease from 2014, when 8 million taxpayers made a payment. Another 12.7 million taxpayers received an exemption but the main reason is because they live in a state that choose not to accept the Medicaid expansion in Obamacare.
