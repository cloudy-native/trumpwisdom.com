I think it's a decision that allows tremendous cheating to go on after the fact but before the votes are tabulated....It is a horrendous decision for our country. It's a mistake. It allows cheating. It allows cheating at a very high level, and very easy cheating, too.”","analysis":"There is no legal requirement that mandates the immediate reporting of all election results in the country; delayed counting is unavoidable when so many people are avoiding election lines during the pandemic. Plenty of presidential elections have remained unsettled on election night, some for days or weeks. Trump baselessly suggests Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, will manipulate the vote count, laying the groundwork for his many unsuccessful challenges to contest his loss in the state.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
