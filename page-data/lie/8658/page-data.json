He has no basis to do that [look into Trump’s personal financial transactions]. He's just a political hack who's trying to build a name for himself. And I think that's fine because that's what they do. But there would be no reason to do that. No other politician has to go through that. It's called presidential harassment, and it's unfortunate.”","analysis":"Trump's business dealings in Russia and elsewhere are already under investigation by federal prosecutors. Trump says House Democrats such as Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the intelligence committee, have no basis to investigate his personal finances. He says no other politician has to go through this, but many politicians' personal finances have been investigated by congressional committees or law enforcement. And no other president has owned a sprawling business while holding office, which poses a range of new questions. For example, Trump's businesses, such as his hotel in Washington, take revenue from foreign governments. That may violate the constitution's emoluments clause (a court case over this question is ongoing).","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
