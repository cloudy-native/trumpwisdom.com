But he's been wrong. First of all, he said, don't wear masks. Very strongly. I'm sure you have that clip. He said don't wear masks. He's said many things. He said, let the Chinese -- let -- let the people from China that are heavily infected, let them come in. He admits that he was wrong on that and he admits that I saved thousands of lives. And it's good if people trust him. But it's not that the people -- reporters like him because they think he's against me.”","analysis":"Trump has three basic complaints about Anthony S. Fauci, the renowned director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But they are bogus. 1) Fauci never said anything like “This will pass.” He spoke as a scientist, evaluating the data in front of him. From the start, he warned of the need to be vigilant. 2) While Fauci did initially express public skepticism about the effectiveness of travel restrictions, by the time of the announcement, Fauci was a supporter of the idea. “These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS,” Health Secretary Alex Azar said shortly after the announcement. 3) As for wearing a mask, Fauci has explained he was motivated by early fears that N95 masks needed by hospital workers would quickly run out of stock. Once science indicated that the virus was spread by people who were asymptomatic, the guidance was updated, because even fabric masks can help halt the spread if everyone wears them.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"29424, 30071, 26942, 27030, 26747, 26718, 26900, 27256, 27399, 26375, 26180, 26307, 26023, 24880, 24801, 24556, 24333, 24211, 23333, 23495, 23130, 23017, 21286, 21716, 20834, 21613, 21082, 21160, 21163, 20870","repeated_count":"30","date":"10/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
