And now they're finding out it was all a big hoax. They're finding out it was a horrible thing.”","analysis":"Stone was convicted of lying to investigators, witness tampering and obstructing congressional investigations into Trump. Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his dealings with the Russian ambassador and other diplomats during the presidential transition. They were not the victims of a hoax.
