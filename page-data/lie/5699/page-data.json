That's not a good comparison, because third quarter growth this year slowed to 3.5 percent -- and growth exceeded 4 percent at several points during Obama's presidency and reached 5.1 percent in the second quarter of 2014. The average for Trump's presidency so far is 2.8 percent, which is not twice Obama's average.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"5471, 6080, 5395, 5541, 5121, 5137, 5688, 5699, 4798, 4904, 4946","repeated_count":"11","date":"09/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
