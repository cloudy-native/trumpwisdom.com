It's only wrong 93% of the time in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's interest in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 130,000. Think of it. You go in and you vote, and then they tell people who you supposed to be voting for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody's ever even heard. They adjudicate your vote. They say, well, we don't think Trump wants to vote for Trump. We think he wants to vote for Biden. Put it down for Biden.”","analysis":"Another fantasy offered by Trump. The Dominion software has a function that flags ballots for adjudication based on defects such as improperly filled bubbles on the ballot or overvotes, when a voter votes for more candidates than allowed. In Fulton County, 113,130 absentee ballots were scanned, and more than 106,000 were adjudicated. (The number includes all ballots in a batch, even if only one ballot needed to be checked.) The vote counts were reconfirmed with two recounts.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/06/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
