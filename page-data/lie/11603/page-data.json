Baltimore is a city, and Trump is comparing Baltimore, an urban area, to countries with a mix of urban and rural areas. It would be more relevant compare the state of Maryland to these countries: The state had a homicide rate of 9 per 100,000 people, compared to El Salvador (50), Honduras (41), and Guatemala (22). Or one could compare cities in those countries with Baltimore. For instance, in 2017 San Salvador’s homicide rate was 59 per 100,000 residents — higher than Baltimore’s 2018 homicide rate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
