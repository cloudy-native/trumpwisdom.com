We could have the Republican votes, 100 percent. We still don't have enough votes. People don't understand that. We need Democrat votes to get it fixed.”","analysis":"Trump's claim that smugglers have only recently learned about U.S. immigration laws is not plausible. What Trump describes as \"loopholes\" are actually important provisions in U.S. humanitarian relief laws for asylum-seekers and refugees. Trump claims his plan to tighten these laws has 100 percent Republican support, but several Republicans did not support it when the White House's preferred bill came to the Senate.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26946, 26835, 26671, 27144, 26210, 26327, 25697, 25568, 25438, 25356, 24434, 24097, 23680, 21591, 22455, 18863, 17785, 16549, 16205, 16476, 16347, 14676, 12687, 11639, 11954, 11939, 11899, 11850, 11141, 11719, 10877, 10263, 10006, 9890, 9645, 9705, 9536, 9297, 9140, 9141, 8852, 8451, 8498, 8324, 8280, 8167, 8195, 8216, 8217, 8223, 7891, 7893, 7910, 7911, 7912, 7148, 7077, 7078, 7079, 7081, 6537, 6557, 6644, 6202, 6386, 6161, 6425, 6486, 5899, 5818, 4401, 4288, 4525, 3892, 3460, 3847, 3945, 3955, 3917, 3936, 3318, 3270, 3202, 3172, 3122, 3083, 2816, 2829, 2695","repeated_count":"89","date":"06/19/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
