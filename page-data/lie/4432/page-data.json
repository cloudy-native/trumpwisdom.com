Even then, experts say the improvement in the economy may not be only reason for the decline. Most states have either no longer qualifiy for or have declined to apply for waivers that allowed some adults to keep their benefits for longer periods of time without employment. Reports have also suggested immigrant families with citizen children have dropped out of the program fearing the administration's immigration policies.  Moreover, the number of people collecting benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly called food stamps, has been declining since fiscal year 2013. It had spiked because of the Great Recession but began declining under President Obama.
