And then, ultimately, Secretary General Stoltenberg -- who, I think, you would say is maybe my biggest fan -- we got them to pay an additional $400 billion -- billion -- other countries.”","analysis":"Trump gives himself too much credit. Since 2006, each NATO member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending. Defense expenditures for NATO countries other than the United States have been going up — in a consistent upward slope — since 2014. That’s when NATO decided to boost spending in response to Russia’s seizure of Ukraine’s Crimea region. NATO estimates that European NATO and Canada will add $130 billion in cumulative defense spending through 2020, in 2015 dollars, as an increase over 2016 spending. NATO also estimates the cumulative figure will rise to $400 billion through 2024.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
