A study by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://publichealth.gwu.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/projects/PRstudy/Acertainment%20of%20the%20Estimated%20Excess%20Mortality%20from%20Hurricane%20Maria%20in%20Puerto%20Rico.pdf\">George Washington University</a> estimated the death toll at between 2,658 and 3,290. Puerto Rico adopted the midpoint number, 2,975, as its official death toll. The island's population dropped 8 percent because of the death toll and heavy outmigration after the hurricanes, according to the GWU study. A separate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694231.pdf\">report</a> by the GAO found a litany of issues that prevented FEMA from responding quickly and efficiently to the Puerto Rican disaster. Full power was not restored to Puerto Rico for 11 months after the hurricanes.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/12/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
