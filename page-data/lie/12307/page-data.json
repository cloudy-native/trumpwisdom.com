Somebody said, 'Oh, he might have rented a room to a man from Saudi Arabia for $500.' What about the $5 billion that I'll lose? You know, it's probably going to cost me -- including upside, downside, lawyers -- because every day, they sue me for something. These are the most litigious people. It's probably costing me from 3 to 5 billion for the privilege of being -- and I couldn't care less.”","analysis":"There is no evidence for nor any way to verify Trump's estimate that he is losing anywhere from $3 billion to $5 billion as president. Trump once admitted in a legal deposition that he sometimes gives estimates of his financial condition based on gut feeling. Trump's net worth is estimated to be about $3 billion. It's highly unlikely being president will cost him more than his net worth -- and he could well profit from it, since he and his family often blur the line between official actions and private business interests, and because he has refused to divest from his business.\n\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"28829, 28160, 27269, 26446, 26081, 17712, 14126, 13845, 13713, 13275, 12307","repeated_count":"11","date":"08/13/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
