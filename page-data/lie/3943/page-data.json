And that goes for almost all small businesses. You won't have the estate tax to pay anymore, which was crippling. That was in our bill. ... I'm honored to have done it, because it was destroying -- the estate tax -- small businesses and farms. Destroying them.”","analysis":"This is an enormous stretch. Repealing the federal estate tax primarily benefits the wealthy. The estate tax rarely falls on farms or small businesses, since only those leaving behind more than $5 million pay it. According to the Tax Policy Center, nearly 5,500 estates in 2017 — out of nearly 3 million — were subject to the tax. Of those, only 80 taxable estates would be farms and small businesses.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"29210, 25753, 26071, 25278, 24425, 23659, 21982, 19308, 17815, 17591, 18403, 17446, 17521, 18319, 16858, 16710, 16544, 13688, 11070, 10471, 10867, 10243, 9965, 9992, 9671, 9520, 8616, 7826, 7363, 6937, 6679, 6039, 6193, 6360, 6470, 5374, 5849, 4912, 4715, 4553, 4291, 4107, 4156, 4073, 4007, 4024, 3943, 2022, 1817, 1815, 1718, 1246, 1258","repeated_count":"53","date":"06/19/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
