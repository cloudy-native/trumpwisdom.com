Auto parts and vehicles produced in each country freely flow over the borders, without tariffs or other restrictions, as thousands of part suppliers serve the automakers that build the vehicles. This is known as the “motor vehicle supply chain.” Technological advances have led to more automation across industries. These and other developments all had an effect on the decline in U.S. manufacturing. “In reality, NAFTA did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics or the large economic gains predicted by supporters,” according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R42965.pdf\">a Congressional Research Service report</a> assessing the legacy of NAFTA. “The net overall effect of NAFTA on the U.S. economy appears to have been relatively modest, primarily because trade with Canada and Mexico accounts for a small percentage of U.S. GDP. However, there were worker and firm adjustment costs as the three countries adjusted to more open trade and investment.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
