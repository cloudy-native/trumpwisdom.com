However, do you –”] No, I wouldn't expect they'd ask. Because why would -- he's a proud man [Putin]. He's done a real job. And why would he ask? No, it's something we discussed and it's under discussion now. No votes or anything. But I would be inclined to say yes, and so would others, and some probably wouldn't be. But it's just a discussion. … I think, ultimately, people like the idea.”","analysis":"According to multiple reports, Trump was the only world leader pushing for Russia's return to the G-7. Other world leaders said it didn't make sense to have a nation hostile to the West -- Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election, for example -- in the group of liberal democracies.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
