Should never have been allowed to begin, except for the Collusion and many crimes committed by the Democrats. Witch Hunt!”","analysis":"Special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- a Trump appointee -- after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. Trump frequently complains about potential conflicts, such as an unverified (and denied) dispute over golf fees when Mueller was a member of a Trump golf club. Eleven out of 16 attorneys on Mueller's team have contributed to Democrats, including Clinton and Obama; 13 are registered Democrats. Under federal law, Mueller is not allowed to consider the political leanings of his staff when hiring them, but he took action against a former team member when texts expressing anti-Trump sentiments were discovered. Throughout the special counsel’s investigation of possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump has sought to deflect attention by asserting that the Democrats colluded with Russia. But he has little evidence to make his case, which largely rests on the fact that the firm hired by Democrats to examine Trump’s Russia ties at the same time was working to defend a Russian company in U.S. court. In fact, U.S. intelligence agencies found that Russian entities hacked Democratic leaders' email during the campaign. Far from being a hoax, the investigation led by Robert Mueller has resulted in the indictments or guilty pleas of 33 people and three Russian companies, including five former Trump advisors and 26 Russian nationals.
