But, again, this trend began in 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea. In July, Stoltenberg told reporters that NATO nations had committed an extra $41 billion in spending since Trump took office in January 2017.

That’s all,” Macron said.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
