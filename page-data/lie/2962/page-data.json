They sold the site for [the London embassy] like $250 million. They think they are geniuses. They go out and buy a horrible location and they build a new embassy. That's the good news. The bad news, the embassy cost over a billion dollars. So, now what do we have? We have an embassy in a lousy location and I was supposed to cut the ribbon. I didn't do the deal. It was started by Bush and Obama. It was a Bush-Obama special, okay, but it could have been stopped by Obama. It would have been stopped by me.”","analysis":"Trump, perhaps wary of planned protests if he visited London, came up with a phony excuse. While he blamed Obama, the decision to move the embassy was made and announced during the George W. Bush administration. The price that could be obtained for the old embassy was limited because it was named an historic building and thus cannot be significantly changed. Nevertheless, the entire cost-- about $1 billion, not $1.2 billion --  was financed through the sale of the existing chancery and other buildings.
