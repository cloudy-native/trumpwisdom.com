I said, 'Show the crowd,' you know what? They have circles. Someday I'm gonna hire the guy that does those circles. No, because it's really good. Big thick nice circles, they're perfectly done. It's the best part of his campaign, the circles. And usually he's got five of them, usually he can't fill them up with people, so he puts the fake news in the circles.”","analysis":"Biden campaign rallies are purposely smaller because he and his surrogates are following federal guidelines designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus; Trump consistently ignores the guidelines and puts his supporters at risk. Trump also wildly overestimates the size of his crowds.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31147, 30336, 30360, 29757, 29860, 29301, 29416, 29599, 29489, 29560, 29938, 30126, 28889, 28660, 28524, 28403, 28989, 29018, 28093, 28118, 28266, 27932, 27697, 27863, 27915, 27926, 27746, 26816, 26725, 27101, 27176, 25767, 25712, 25533, 25632, 25634, 25020","repeated_count":"37","date":"10/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
