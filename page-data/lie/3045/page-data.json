His approval with black men a week before was 11 percent with this poll, which uses a non-probability online sample, a methodology that a 2014 Pew Research study found doesn't necessarily accurately represent African Americans. A Pew Research Center poll released on May 3 reported that only 13 percent of African Americans approve of Trump. In January that number was 14 percent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/04/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
