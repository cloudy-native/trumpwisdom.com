We have looked closely at the Keystone numbers, and the same methodological issues appear to apply to the Dakota estimates. The actual number of Keystone construction jobs, for instance, is just 3,900 on an annualized basis — and other jobs have already been created (such as for building high-strength line pipe.) In the context of the U.S. economy, which just in June added 222,000 jobs, these are not many jobs.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"20987, 22545, 17999, 18471, 16970, 17510, 14040, 15099, 10992, 10461, 10015, 9940, 9941, 9379, 7176, 6362, 5846, 4783, 4378, 4306, 4161, 2738, 2405, 2330, 2191, 2132, 1860, 1603, 1574, 1262, 1259, 1211, 1124, 0783, 0834, 0741, 0691, 0627, 0484, 0354, 0327, 0180, 0151, 0115, 0094, 0018","repeated_count":"46","date":"07/12/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
