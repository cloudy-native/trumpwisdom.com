Trump appears to be citing the exit-poll results only for white women, in which he got 52 percent. But for all women, exits polls show he received only 41 percent. Clinton received the votes of 54 percent of all women. Meanwhile, Trump's standing among African Americans remains poor. He appears to have focused on the fact that he got 8 percent of the black vote vs. 6 percent for Mitt Romney in 2012 and 4 percent for John McCain in 2008. In the polling world, a two- or even four-percentage-point shift is relatively small. Moreover, who was running as a Democrat in 2008 and 2012? The first African American candidate, Barack Obama. Trump was not running against a black man, so that further discounts his claims of a substantial achievement. Strictly by the numbers, Trump actually did worse than any Republican running against a white man, though in effect he came close to tying George W. Bush in 2000 and Ronald Reagan in 1984.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"30337, 30381, 29835, 29436, 29636, 25369, 25212, 24811, 24385, 24231, 20718, 17193, 15307, 15324, 14258, 14081, 13154, 10055, 7166, 2938, 0170, 0043","repeated_count":"22","date":"09/21/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
