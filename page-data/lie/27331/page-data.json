And I said to my very talented, who is one of the greatest lawyers in New York, David Friedman, a great lawyer. I said David, see if you could get a piece of land cheap or a piece that we already own because they want to spend $2 billion to build this thing. I said we could do it cheaper, calls me back two days later. Sir, we have a piece of land with a building on it. I think we can renovate it for $350,000 and it'll be nicer than the one they want to build. So we did it for $350,000, I actually -- first time in my life, I said, David, I've never said this before, it sounds too cheap, make it $500,000. So instead of spending $1 billion to $2 billion, probably would have never got built.”","analysis":"The new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem for about $400,000. (Trump sometimes claims it cost $500,000.)
