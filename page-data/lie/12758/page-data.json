But number two, it's many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb that worked very well. And very importantly -- I don't know if you know this -- they have warnings. If it breaks, it's considered a hazardous waste site. It's gasses inside. And read what they say: 'If it breaks, bring it to your local whatever. Have it wrapped, have it this.\" What are we doing? What are we doing? And I said to one of the top people today, 'Well, they break a lot. Don't they?' 'Yes, sir.' 'What do they do?' 'They just throw them away. They don't care.' But they call it 'hazardous waste.' But it's many times more expensive.”","analysis":"Trump is trying to justify the weakening of rules to promote the extension of light bulb energy-efficiency standards. He appears to be talking about compact fluorescent, or CFL, bulbs, which contain mercury and tend to have harsher color quality. But he's out of date. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nema.org/Intelligence/Indices/Pages/LED-A-line-Halogen-and-CFL-Lamp-Shipments-Decrease-in-First-Quarter-2019-Compared-to-First-Quarter-2018.aspx\">says</a> that in 2019 CFLs accounted for less than 5 percent of all sales of the classic pear-shaped bulbs. Light-emitting diode, or LED, bulbs are the dominant environmentally friendly technology. They don't have safety risks and often provide comparable light at a cheaper lifetime cost than incandescents. LEDs currently made up more than 70 percent of sales.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"21307, 21182, 16330, 13543, 13733, 12758, 12708","repeated_count":"7","date":"09/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
