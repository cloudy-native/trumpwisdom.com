Bill Clinton even reached an agreement that shuttered the Yongbyon nuclear facility and froze Pyongyang's production of plutonium for eight years. The deal collapsed during the George W. Bush administration, but then Bush made some headway after North Korea's first nuclear test, including the dismantling of a cooling tower at Yongbyon. The Obama administration in 2012 also reached a short-lived agreement with North Korea to suspend its nuclear weapons tests and uranium enrichment and allow international inspectors to monitor activities at its main nuclear complex.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"8915","repeated_count":"1","date":"02/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
