They use non-existent 'sources' and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family. Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked & respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if it means lying or making up stories. Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media!”","analysis":"Trump wrote this just days after Haberman shared in winning a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the Russian investigation. There is also no reporter that Trump speaks with more often than Haberman. Mainstream news organizations may make mistake but they do not invent sources.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/21/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
