Investigative warrants were duly authorized by judges. Trump suggests these criminal investigations were out of bounds, but there's no evidence that the investigations were tainted by corruption and in fact several Trump campaign advisers have pleaded guilty. Trump has previously claimed that Obama wiretapped his phones at Trump Tower, but there's no evidence of that, either.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/29/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
