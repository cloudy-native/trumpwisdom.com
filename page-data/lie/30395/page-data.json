We were getting ready to win this election.”","analysis":"This is baseless speculation. Because there were so many outstanding votes to be counted in swing states, networks could no longer call any races. The Biden campaign did not file any suits; instead, the Trump campaign and its allies filed dozens of suits in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin and Nevada. Trump and his allies compiled a 1-60 loss record.
