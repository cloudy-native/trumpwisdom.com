I said, I'm ready. And he led me to a ramp that was long and steep and slippery. And I said, I got a problem because I wear, you know, the leather bottom shoes. I can show them to you if you like.

I said, General, I got a problem here. That ramp is slippery.…So I'm going to go real easy. So I did. And then the last 10 feet I ran down. They always stop it just before I ran, they always stop it.”","analysis":"It was a beautiful day and reporters said the ramp did not appear to be wet. Trump did not run the last ten feet.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
