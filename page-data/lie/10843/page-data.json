The closest approximation was from an interview that McCarthy gave Fox News: “No. No, we support this president. And why, when you're about to have a meeting – the secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, is meeting with Mexico tomorrow. We want to solve this crisis at the border – Why wouldn't you help them be as strong as they can be? Stand up with him, and you know what, if you give the president his strongest hand, you’ll never end up with tariffs and we'll have a border that is secure.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
