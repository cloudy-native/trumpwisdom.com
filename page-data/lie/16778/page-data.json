The FBI relied on some information in the dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant on a former Trump campaign official, and the Justice Department Inspector General identified mistakes in the handling of the FISA applications. He did not say the FBI's actions were illegal or criminal and he concluded there was no bias in FBI decision-making.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
