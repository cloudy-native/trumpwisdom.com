(Those answers were \"inadequate,\" according to Mueller's report.) Trump does not specify which statements in the report he thinks are B.S., but he has complained especially about his former White House counsel, Donald McGahn. McGahn was a key witness for Mueller's investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice. According to McGahn's testimony as laid out in the Mueller report, Trump directed McGahn to have Mueller removed. McGahn refused. Trump later told McGahn he never asked him to fire Mueller. That was false, according to the Mueller report.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
