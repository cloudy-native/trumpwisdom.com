MS-13 often attempts to recruit young immigrants, but Trump's suggestion that all of the gang's members entered as unaccompanied minors is not supported by evidence.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/23/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
