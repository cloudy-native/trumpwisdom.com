Zero, I have none. I have none. I said I have more Indian blood in me than she has and she choked she said, 'I'm gonna show oh, I'm gonna show.' She hired this company and they went out and did a blood test, 1,024, correct? So that means I probably won somewhere down the line a million years ago. I'm telling you that was horrible.”","analysis":"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released the results of her DNA test, which showed that she likely had a sixth generation ancestor with Native American heritage in the mid-1800s. Early news reports had incorrectly suggested a range of 1/64th to 1/1024th, which some misreported as less than the average European-American. Trump has seized on the misleading news reports to incorrectly say she has no Native American heritage. She has some but her DNA is more than 95 percent European-American.
