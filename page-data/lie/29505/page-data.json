Trump used both figures in the past but somehow, especially in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, he started to say Hunter Biden earned $183,000 a month. There is no evidence that is true, so we will assume this is typical Trumpian exaggeration. He also often claims Hunter Biden received a $3 million up-front payment but has offered no evidence to back that up. (Any offspring of a prominent politician needs to be wary of even the appearance of a conflict of interest between the child's business interests and the parent's political position, so we are not excusing Hunter Biden's poor judgement in accepting this position.)
