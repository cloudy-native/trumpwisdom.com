There have been 436,000 manufacturing jobs created since January 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.This is an impressive gain for almost two years; under President Barack Obama, about 900,000 manufacturing jobs were gained over seven years from the 2010 nadir after the Great Recession. Moreover, despite the recent gains, the number of manufacturing jobs is still nearly 1 million below the level at the start of the Great Recession in December 2007.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"29055, 28744, 25687, 25495, 26587, 26013, 23996, 21309, 18856, 16732, 16704, 16337, 12749, 12689, 12324, 11644, 11207, 10859, 10236, 9867, 9696, 9510, 9423, 9183, 9108, 8950, 8719, 8608, 7364, 7395, 6786, 6935, 6968, 7124, 6824, 6911, 6606, 6763, 7055, 6573, 6307, 6016, 6393, 6461, 5905, 5415, 5600, 5345, 5364, 5316, 5524, 5821, 5841, 5221, 5768, 5124, 5370, 5019, 4790, 4906, 4945","repeated_count":"61","date":"02/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
