The number of drug addicts officially registered with the Chinese government rose to about 2.5 million in 2013 from just under a million in 2001. First-time offenders are generally sent to drug treatment centers, while repeat offenders are often sent to “education through labor” camps.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"8988, 8878, 8831, 2850","repeated_count":"4","date":"02/22/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
