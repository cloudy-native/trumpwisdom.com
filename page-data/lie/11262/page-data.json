Reports have suggested that some minors from Central America are coming to the U.S. border with adults who are not their parents. But the number of suspected cases of fraudulent parentage is a fraction of the overall number of family units apprehended. The Post’s Joshua Partlow and Nick Miroff reported, between April 19, when the trend was first suspected, and Sept. 30, the end of the 2018 fiscal year, CBP agents separated 170 families after determining that the child and adult traveling together were not related. That equals about 0.25 percent of all family units apprehended. It's well documented that families are fleeing gang violence in Central America.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/23/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
