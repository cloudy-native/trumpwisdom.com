It reached a low of 5.9 percent in May 2018, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000006\">rose to 6.7 percent in March</a>, the most recent month available. An older set of government data suggests black unemployment went much lower in the 1950s. Similarly, Hispanic unemployment rates have been calculated only since 1972, so it's an exaggeration to say the current numbers are the lowest ever. The rate reached a low in February but rose to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000009\">4.7 percent in March</a>.  The Asian-American statistic has been around for less than 20 years. And while it reached a low of 2.1 percent rate in May 2018, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNU04032183\">it had risen to 3.0 percent in March</a>. Lately, Trump has been using the word \"reached,\" perhaps to indicate the lows are in the past.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
