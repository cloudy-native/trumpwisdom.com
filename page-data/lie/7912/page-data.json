We do paperwork. We bring them to court. You can never have enough judges because you're talking about thousands -- tens of thousands of people. You end up in trials, but the trials don't take place, because what they have to do -- because it's impossible to hold all of it. This is by law.”","analysis":"Trump is routinely astonished by the workings of U.S. and international laws on asylum. This is how it works in any country that abides by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees: A refugee enters and makes a petition, and the government makes a ruling after analyzing the facts.

Trump's claim that the \"trials don't take place\" is false. The Justice Department reports that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1107056/download#page=34\">72 percent</a> of immigrants showed up for their hearings in fiscal 2017, including 89 percent of asylum-seekers.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26946, 26835, 26671, 27144, 26210, 26327, 25697, 25568, 25438, 25356, 24434, 24097, 23680, 21591, 22455, 18863, 17785, 16549, 16205, 16476, 16347, 14676, 12687, 11639, 11954, 11939, 11899, 11850, 11141, 11719, 10877, 10263, 10006, 9890, 9645, 9705, 9536, 9297, 9140, 9141, 8852, 8451, 8498, 8324, 8280, 8167, 8195, 8216, 8217, 8223, 7891, 7893, 7910, 7911, 7912, 7148, 7077, 7078, 7079, 7081, 6537, 6557, 6644, 6202, 6386, 6161, 6425, 6486, 5899, 5818, 4401, 4288, 4525, 3892, 3460, 3847, 3945, 3955, 3917, 3936, 3318, 3270, 3202, 3172, 3122, 3083, 2816, 2829, 2695","repeated_count":"89","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
