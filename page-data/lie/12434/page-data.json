In other words, 17,000 criminal aliens were released by these cities directly into U.S. communities.”","analysis":"This is mostly false. The 17,000 figure is an estimate from a group of immigration hard-liners, not a government figure, and it covers a 19-month period from 2014 to 2015, not \"last year alone.\" Furthermore, all U.S. states and territories, including sanctuary cities, enforce criminal laws. That means that any undocumented immigrants booked for violent crimes are highly unlikely to be released pending trial. Trump uses the highly charged term \"criminal alien\" but in most cases the offense at issue is crossing the border without authorization.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
