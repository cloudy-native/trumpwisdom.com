And after nearly 60 years of really crooked Democrat rule, it's one of the poorest cities in America. It was one of the most successful cities in America.”","analysis":"Corruption played a role in Detroit’s decline but it’s misleading to pin all of the city’s problems on corrupt officials. The structural shifts in auto manufacturing led to massive job losses and deindustrialization which are more directly to blame. The city also suffered race riots which led to white flight and many small businesses to shutter permanently.
