Progress was made, with at least two vaccines showing good results announced shortly after election day. (Ironically, the process went faster than expected because the U.S. caseload was so high.) The first doses were delivered in December. But many health experts say a vaccine for this coronavirus would not be ready for mass distribution until 2021. Experts also say a focus on a vaccine as a cure is misplaced, since it may give people false hope that they do not need to practice social distancing and good hygiene.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"23585, 23295, 23129, 23189, 21992, 22024, 21917, 21967, 22348, 21567, 22405, 22441, 22469, 21228, 20703, 20725, 20661, 20772, 19964, 19980, 20274, 20356, 19335, 19058, 19224, 19075, 19038, 17945, 18064, 18069, 18080, 18585","repeated_count":"32","date":"08/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
