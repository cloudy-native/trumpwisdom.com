You have to sign papers. You get it 'cause you can't be there. That's one thing. When they sent 80 million ballots to people, they have no idea where they're going.”","analysis":"All wrong. Some states were mailing ballots to all registered voters, accounting for 51 million voters combined, according to a Washington Post tally. (In California alone, that means 20 million ballots were mailed.) Other states, with a combined 44 million voters, were simply mailing ballot applications. In all of these cases, people had to register to vote before receiving a ballot or ballot application in the mail. That means they had to provide identification and a signature before receiving any ballots. Despite Trump's scaremongering, the ballot verification process is the same whether one requests a ballot, or fills out a ballot application, or gets a ballot automatically.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
