A border-free zone where thousands of criminal aliens can roam free. A very, very dangerous situation -- unacceptable to everyone.”","analysis":"Trump's claim that sanctuary jurisdictions \"violate\" the Constitution is untested. The courts decide what is and isn't constitutional, and there is not yet a definitive ruling on this question. (The Trump administration is currently suing California, a sanctuary state.) It's worth noting that under the 10th Amendment, the federal government cannot force states to help enforce federal law. Immigration matters are left exclusively to the federal government. So when cities or states adopt sanctuary policies, they are not necessarily \"nullifying\" federal law, because they cannot be compelled to enforce immigration laws in the first place. It's also not clear what data Trump is relying on to claim that \"thousands of criminal aliens can roam free\" in California. Many deportable individuals covered by sanctuary laws do not have criminal records.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
