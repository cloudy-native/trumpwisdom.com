The only study that claims a 10-year approval is common comes from a pro-deregulation group, which raises questions about its reliability. This still falls short of Trump's 20-year claim.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"31307, 30468, 29542, 29113, 28786, 28049, 28129, 27975, 27581, 27798, 27064, 26920, 27303, 26448, 26166, 25389, 25198, 23874, 23699, 22077, 22354, 21187, 22569, 19405, 18458, 16971, 17321, 18204, 16106, 15829, 15677, 14058, 14059, 12289, 10482, 10894, 9935, 9690, 8948, 6855, 6128, 4448, 4265, 4264, 4263, 2711, 2526, 2190, 4262","repeated_count":"49","date":"04/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
