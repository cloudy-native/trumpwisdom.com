I have never seen the Evangelical Christians more angry over any issue than this attempt to illegitimately remove this President from office, overturn the 2016.... ....Election, and negate the votes of millions of Evangelicals in the process. They know the only Impeachable offense that President Trump has committed was beating Hillary Clinton in 2016.”","analysis":"U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and the U.S. charges d'affaires in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, have both indicated that they either suspect or could not rule out a quid pro quo in Trump's push to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. The Trump administration went outside normal channels to withhold security aid for Ukraine and Trump also dangled a prospective meeting between himself and the Ukrainian president while he pressed for the investigation of Biden, a potential Democratic opponent in the 2020 election. The White House readout of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lays out that Trump was offering to meet with Zelensky at the same time he was asking for the Biden probe. In addition, a quid pro quo could have been implicit and still be a weighty matter for investigators to probe. If Trump were impeached, Vice President Pence would assume the presidency, so the 2016 election hardly would be overturned.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/29/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
