That's the largest amount of money ever given to any state -- talking about states and Puerto Rico; a little different -- $91 billion. Texas got $30 billion]. Florida got $12 [billion]. Puerto Rico got $91 billion. … Now, you remember how big the hurricane was in Texas? The largest water dump in the history of our country, they say. Three times -- it went in, went out, went in. Texas got $30 billion.”","analysis":"As of the time of this comment, Puerto Rico had only received over $11 billion out of nearly $41 billion in funds that have been appropriated. Trump’s $91 billion figure includes $50 billion in additional estimated liabilities that could emerge over the next 20 years, but that’s a figure subject to change. Trump sometimes suggests that the money has already been received but that’s simply wrong. By the end of fiscal year 2019, the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates, Puerto Rico will have received about $21 billion. While Trump often says this is an all-time record, Congress spent $120 billion on Hurricane Katrina, spread across three states.
