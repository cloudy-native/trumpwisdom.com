But 9,653 of them were \"inadmissibles,\" which CBP defines as \"individuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible, individuals presenting themselves to seek humanitarian protection under our laws, and individuals who withdraw an application for admission and return to their countries of origin within a short timeframe.\" Moreover, the number of inadmissibles declined January to February, and although the total for southwest border apprehensions increased, it does not come close to the monthly records set in the early 2000s.
