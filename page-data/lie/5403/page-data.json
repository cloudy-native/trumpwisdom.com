I loved Ohio. I loved Ohio. ...I love the Queen City. We had a job, Swifton Village, Swifton. Does anyone ever hear of Swifton? And it was a great experience. It was a successful experience. I did it with my father, one of my earliest things that I've done, and I guess it's sort of like if you get your first up as a hit, you're a hitter, you hit, you sink the 10-foot putt on the first hole.”","analysis":"Trump did spend time in Cincinnati at Swifton Village. By all accounts, at best, he did menial labor around the property and we found no evidence that he ever lived there or \"worked there\" with any regularity. There were charges of discrimination and a lawsuit during the Trumps ownership tenure. Without knowing the cost of repairs or legal expenses and the rental income, it's impossible to know if they profited on the project, but all signs suggest any profit they made was not a windfall or a great success by Trumpian standards.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"27802, 19283, 17270, 11591, 5403, 5433, 4413","repeated_count":"7","date":"10/12/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
