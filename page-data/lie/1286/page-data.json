Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won't fail.”","analysis":"This is an odd statement. Trump uses the \"Rocket Man\" nickname for Kim Jong-Un. It's unclear whether Trump knows that there have been three North Korean leaders since Bill Clinton's presidency, all with the last name Kim. It's a misleading claim that the past three presidents have \"all been outplayed by this gentleman.\" It's actually three men in the same Kim family: Kim Il-Sung, Kim Jong-Il and Kim Jong-Un. Clinton, Bush and Obama would dispute that they were \"nice\" to North Korean leaders.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"9159, 9004, 8710, 8352, 8294, 6297, 5328, 5531, 5720, 5157, 4592, 4367, 4302, 4033, 3971, 3924, 16809, 3367, 3305, 3298, 3301, 2949, 2905, 2805, 2632, 2802, 2550, 2489, 2491, 2301, 2075, 2111, 1984, 1955, 1893, 1333, 1317, 1317, 1286, 1286, 1268, 0996, 0580, 0495","repeated_count":"44","date":"10/01/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
