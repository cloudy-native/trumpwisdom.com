And our economy, if you look at the numbers, since my election, is up almost 50 percent.”","analysis":"Trump is boiling things down to stock market performance, but his numbers are off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 30 percent from the time Trump took office to the time he made these remarks. The S&P 500 was up roughly 20 percent and the Nasdaq composite index was up around 30 percent. Measuring from the 2016 election does not get him to 50 percent, either. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index is basically flat since Trump took the oath of offfice. The president appears to be getting the 38 percent figure from the high the index achieved in June 2016, but it fell sharply before Trump became president.
