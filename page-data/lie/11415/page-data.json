The Obama administration would not sell them the Patriot missiles. They need the Patriot missiles for defense. They would not sell them, under any circumstance. And Turkey tried very hard to buy them, and they wouldn't sell them, and this went on for a long period of time...But, by that time, Turkey had already signed and paid a lot of money to Russia for the missile system that they were not allowed to buy here, foolishly -- because Turkey is a NATO member.”","analysis":"Trump offers a rosy view that could have been issued by the Turkish foreign ministry. In reality, the U.S. has sought to sell to Turkey the Patriot air-defense missile since at least 2013, but the Turks insisted it come with a transfer of technology so that Turkey can develop and build its own missiles. The Obama administration refused. An earlier deal between China and Turkey also fell through over technology-transfer conditions. It's unclear whether Turkey got what it wanted from Russia when it purchased the S-400, Moscow's most advanced air-defense system. Integrating the Russian system into NATO’s second-largest army could help Moscow gather intelligence on the stealth capabilities of the next generation F-35 fighter planes. (Turkish manufacturers help build the F-35.) Despite Trump's defense of Turkey, Congress may still impose sanctions.
