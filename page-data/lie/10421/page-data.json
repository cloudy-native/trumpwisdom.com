This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S., 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree.”","analysis":"Trump appears to be quoting from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.econpol.eu/sites/default/files/2018-11/EconPol_Policy_Brief_11_Zoller_Felbermayr_Tariffs.pdf\">a study by European economists</a> that predicted that a 25 percentage point increase in tariffs raises U.S. consumer prices on all affected Chinese products by only 4.5% on average, while the producer price of Chinese firms declines by 20.5%. The study attributed that to the fact the U.S. government \"strategically levied import duties on goods with high import elasticities, which transfers a great share of the tariff burden on to Chinese exporters.\" The study was released in November, using previously released studies from the 1990s, not actual data on prices. But <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/papers/CEPR-DP13564.pdf\">a paper</a> published on March 2 by three prominent U.S. economists found exactly the opposite had happened when actual trade data was studied. \"Overall, using standard economic methods, we find that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018,\" they reported. \"We find that the U.S. tariffs were almost completely passed through into U.S. domestic prices, so that the entire incidence of the tariffs fell on domestic consumers and importers up to now, with no impact so far on the prices received by foreign exporters. We also find that U.S. producers responded to reduced import competition by raising their prices.\" Another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.econ.ucla.edu/pfajgelbaum/RTP.pdf\">paper</a>, published March 3 by a different set of economists, found similar results. \"Tradable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties are the most negatively affected by the trade war,\" the paper said. One of those studies pegged the cost of tariffs announced thus far (including the most recent escalation on $200 billion of Chinese goods) at $831 per U.S. household.
