But John Dingell earned his burial at Arlington Cemetery because he’s a World War II veteran.” Trump also implied that he arranged for Dingell to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda, but Dingell did not lie in state there (and such decisions are left to congressional leaders, not the president).\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
