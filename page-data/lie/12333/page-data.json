When a Conservative does even a fraction of what Chris Cuomo did with his lunatic ranting, raving, & cursing, they get destroyed by the Fake News. But when a Liberal Democrat like Chris Cuomo does it, Republicans immediately come to his defense. We never learn!”","analysis":"Trump is seizing on a single incident to make a dubious point. A man had called Cuomo \"Fredo,\" in reference to the weak Corleone brother from The Godfather, as Cuomo was with his family. Cuomo responded angrily and profanely. A video emerged of the incident, and Sean Hannity of Fox News defended Cuomo. Even after Trump's tweet, Hannity said he was still right. \"Last night on Twitter I defended Cuomo—he did not start this—because I don't support harassment of any public figure. Especially in front of their children, and their family, and their wife,\" Hannity said. \"\"No person in this country should be taunted because of their political beliefs or opinions, and with that said, 'Fredo' was designed to be an insult… It was an insult. He was like the dumb brother in the show. So he's insulting Chris Cuomo. And Chris has a right to defend himself.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/13/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
