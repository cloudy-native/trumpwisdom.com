It debuted with a big splash in the 2003-2004 season, and immediately ranked seventh among primetime shows, averaging almost 21 million viewers a week. But that was the show’s only year in the top 10. After its second season, neither The Apprentice nor its successor, The Celebrity Apprentice, cracked the top 20 again. Four years into its run, roughly half as many people watched as had when the show debuted.
