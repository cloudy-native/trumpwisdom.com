In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book. With that being said, the... ...transcripts of my calls with President Zelensky are all the proof that is needed, in addition to the fact that President Zelensky & the Foreign Minister of Ukraine said there was no pressure and no problems. Additionally, I met with President Zelensky at the United Nations... ...(Democrats said I never met) and released the military aid to Ukraine without any conditions or investigations - and far ahead of schedule. I also allowed Ukraine to purchase Javelin anti-tank missiles. My Administration has done far more than the previous Administration.”","analysis":"Bolton, who served as Trump's national security adviser, wrote in a book that the president told him in August 2019 \"that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in security assistance to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats including the Bidens,\" according to reporting in the New York Times. That undercuts Trump's defense that he did not improperly tie the security aid to political favors. The transcript of a July 25 phone call shows Trump repeatedly asking Ukraine's president for these same political favors right after the Ukrainian leader mentions the U.S. security assistance. With much riding on U.S. assistance, Ukraine's president said there was no pressure on the phone call. But he later criticized Trump for delaying the security funds. A meeting at the UN does not carry the same halo effect as a meeting in the White House, especially for a new Ukrainian president battling corruption and seeking legitimacy on the world stage. The military aid was not released ahead of schedule. It was released days before the congressional appropriation would have lapsed, and Congress had to pass a new bill to ensure that some of the funds would get to Ukraine because of the delays.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
