The New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/politics/russian-bounty-trump.html\">reported</a> that intelligence reports of Russia offering bounties to the Taliban to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan were included in the Presidential Daily Briefing document on Feb. 27, 2020, or sometime in late February 2020. Trump is wrong to say \"everyone is denying it\" and to suggest the story came from a single anonymous source who spoke to the Times. Multiple news organizations including The Washington Post have confirmed key details of the story. Defense Department officials have said the intelligence was real but inconclusive (which is often true for battlefield intelligence).\"I sent the intelligence guys back to continue to dig on it. And I believe they're continuing to dig right now,\" Gen. Frank McKenzie, the commander of U.S. Central Command, said July 7.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/28/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
