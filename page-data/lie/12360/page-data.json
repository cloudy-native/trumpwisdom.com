I mean, what they do, The New York Times, The Washington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, these are -- these are really disgraceful. I mean -- and I see it better than somebody would. You know, If you look and you know a person sitting there wouldn't know if it's truthful or not because they don't know. I give something out that I know is what I want and what is true and they will report it.”","analysis":"When Trump doesn't like what's being reported, he calls it fake news. But in almost every case, the reports are proven to be accurate and the substance of Trump's complaint is that the facts reflect poorly on him. Reputable news organizations follow ethical rules and correct mistakes promptly, something Trump knows since he often celebrates these corrections on Twitter. These overheated comments are not based in facts.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
