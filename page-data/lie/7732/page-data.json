Mexican officials have already identified several and deported them, so they are no longer a potential threat. Trump's assertions are based on a fuzzy news release, and a later Facebook post by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, to justify presidential assertions, and officials refused to explain how the numbers were calculated. Still, numbers issued by DHS are roughly consistent with the percentage of people with criminal pasts — 5 percent — in the 2014 surge. So it may not be completely out of line even if the possible criminality is hyped.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"11421, 8827, 8600, 8641, 8329, 7719, 7732, 7703, 7577, 7578, 7327, 7331, 7515, 7546, 7521, 7522, 7535, 7506, 6728, 6958, 6982, 7102, 7105, 7106, 7149, 6798, 6817, 6515, 6605, 6748, 6752, 6753, 7031, 7032, 7034, 7075, 7087, 7093, 6534, 6536, 6548, 6549, 6558, 6630, 6652, 6653, 6268, 6269, 6293, 6231, 5984, 6011, 6187, 6196, 6197, 5202, 6334, 6340, 6354, 6355, 6135, 6137, 6159, 6422, 6455, 6456, 6457, 6458, 6468, 5458, 5461, 5489, 5491","repeated_count":"73","date":"12/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
