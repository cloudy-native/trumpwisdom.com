No country in the world is hiring judges like that.”","analysis":"The U.S. has about 350 immigration judges, and funding has been authorized for another 100 or so. There's no evidence that anyone has asked Trump to hire thousands more. One bill by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) would add around 700. The president also says no other country in the world has judges hearing immigration cases. That's misleading. Plenty of countries have independent officials in the executive branch deciding who is and isn’t a refugee or an asylee. And in many of those countries, the courts are a last resort for these claims.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/21/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
