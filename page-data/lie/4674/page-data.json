These lawmakers are just fine with this!”","analysis":"The U.S. trade deficit in 2017 was $566 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Trump gets his $800 billion number by looking only at the deficit for trade in goods ($810 billion) even though U.S. trade in services runs a substantial surplus of $244 billion. Trump regularly complains about the trade deficit with China, saying it is $500 billion. But it was $310 billion in 2016. The goods deficit in 2017 was $375 billion, but that will be lower when the trade in services figure is calculated.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"15701, 11707, 10631, 10559, 10384, 9873, 9675, 9311, 9106, 8999, 8890, 8368, 7320, 7305, 7394, 6583, 6220, 6019, 6117, 5444, 5254, 5726, 4510, 4607, 4674, 3718, 3657, 3674, 3576, 4027, 3400, 3363, 3661, 3325, 3215, 2588, 2543, 2478, 2493, 2500, 2485, 2469, 2468, 1736, 1646, 1591, 0359, 0264, 0237","repeated_count":"49","date":"08/28/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
