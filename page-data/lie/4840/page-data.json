You figure that one okay just figure that one and they have a 96% if you shoot two of them up which the company likes. But if you shoot two of them up, you have a hundred percent, but that cost you another $5 million.”","analysis":"The president speaks with confidence but descends into hyperbole. No single interceptor for ICBMs has demonstrated a 96-percent success rate, and there is no guarantee using two interceptors has a 100-percent success rate. Moreover, the military’s suggestion that it could achieve a 97-percent success rate with four interceptors appears based on faulty assumptions and over enthusiastic math. The odds of success under the most ideal conditions are no better than 50-50, and likely worse, as documented in detailed government assessments.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"1376","repeated_count":"1","date":"09/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
