It derived from a list circulated by the Trump campaign saying 3,062 people voted after moving out of state. Using fuzzy math, Schlapp then tripled the figure. But there are all sorts of reasons people can legally vote in a state after moving out of it, such as attending college or serving in the military. Republicans may have been able to turn up <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-11-10/single-nevada-case-shows-futility-of-trump-effort-to-reverse-election-result\">one possible case</a> of a dead person voting, though it’s still being investigated. (Another case appears to be a mix-up: The ballot was signed by the dead person’s daughter, who did not cast her own ballot.) Biden ultimately won Nevada by more than 33,000 votes.
