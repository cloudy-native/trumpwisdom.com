Mexican officials have already identified several and deported them, so they are no longer a potential threat. Trump's figure of 300 people is based on a fuzzy news release to justify presidential assertions, and officials refused to explain how the numbers were calculated. Still, numbers issued by DHS — 270 to 470 — are roughly consistent with the percentage of people with criminal pasts — 5 percent — in the 2014 surge. So it may not be completely out of line even if the possible criminality is hyped. \n","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"11421, 8827, 8600, 8641, 8329, 7719, 7732, 7703, 7577, 7578, 7327, 7331, 7515, 7546, 7521, 7522, 7535, 7506, 6728, 6958, 6982, 7102, 7105, 7106, 7149, 6798, 6817, 6515, 6605, 6748, 6752, 6753, 7031, 7032, 7034, 7075, 7087, 7093, 6534, 6536, 6548, 6549, 6558, 6630, 6652, 6653, 6268, 6269, 6293, 6231, 5984, 6011, 6187, 6196, 6197, 5202, 6334, 6340, 6354, 6355, 6135, 6137, 6159, 6422, 6455, 6456, 6457, 6458, 6468, 5458, 5461, 5489, 5491","repeated_count":"73","date":"11/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
