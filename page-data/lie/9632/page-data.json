Trump’s $91 billion figure includes $50 billion in additional estimated liabilities that could emerge over the next 20 years, but that’s a figure subject to change. Trump sometimes suggests that the money has already been received but that’s simply wrong. By the end of fiscal year 2019, the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates, Puerto Rico will have received about $21 billion. The federal aid after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 amounted to $120 billion, though Louisiana’s share of that amounts to $76 billion. Hurricane Maria was Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in nearly a century, and the government there was already grappling with near insolvency.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"17204, 12613, 12145, 11332, 10598, 10560, 10561, 10850, 10379, 9632, 9799, 9474","repeated_count":"12","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
