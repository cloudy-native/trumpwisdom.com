We're going to give you single payer.\" They don't say that you're going to wipe out 180 private plans that people love.”","analysis":"Trump apparently means to refer to the 180 million or so Americans who receive health insurance through employers, not that there are \"180 private plans.\" A single-payer health care system would not \"wipe out all healthcare;\" it would simply have the government pay the bills. But it may be costly, in terms of higher taxes, though advocates say it would bring the cost of health care down. Trump’s numbers for private insurance are a little off. The Census Bureau <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-264.pdf#page=10\">says</a> that in 2017, 217 million Americans had private insurance, with 181 million covered through an employer and 52 million directly purchasing it. Meanwhile, 123 million Americans are covered already through a government plan, such as Medicare, Medicaid or the military health system.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
