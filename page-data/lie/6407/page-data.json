We're protecting -- you got to pay. They weren't paying. Close to $100 billion a year, we got it. That they pay.”","analysis":"Excluding the U.S., NATO members have collectively increased defense spending by $11.4 billion over the past year, when adjusted for inflation and using 2010 prices and exchange rates. Trump could be referencing the same calculation in today’s dollars, which comes to $34 billion, not $44 billion or $100 billion. Plus, the notion that they are \"paying more\" is still very misguided. This is simple what countries spend on their own defense.
