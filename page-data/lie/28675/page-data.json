I got the building built for a tiny fraction, you know that story, right? Tiny fraction. I called up our great Ambassador, David Friedman. I said David, let's see if we can get it open. They wanted to spend 2 billion dollars to build an Embassy, do you believe, and it would've never happened. I said David, go around, do we have any land that we own with the government? We own everything, right? Even in other countries. See what we have. He calls me back the following day, he says Sir, we own a great piece much better than the piece they were gonna buy. We didn't buy it 'cause I didn't like it. I didn't like the location, does that make sense? 'Cause I'm in the real estate b -- I didn't like location, locations very important. I said see what we have, he said Sir, we have a piece that's much bigger it's in a much better location and it has a building. Now remember, we're gonna spend between a billion and 2 billion dollars. I said, well what's the building? He said, the building is a building that's basically unoccupied, it's pretty big, we could fix it up. I said how much? He said, let me get back to you. He gets back to me two days later, Sir I think we can do it for $390,000 dollars. Right, right, you understand that Mr. Congress. So I said, you know, it's the first time I've ever done this. I said, David that doesn't sound good it sounds to cheap, make it a little more, make it 500, okay. And we did, we did it for $500,000…We had it opened four months later for $500,000 dollars. That means -- 'Cause you know what, not only would it have cost more than 2 billion dollars you wouldn't have that building built for 25 years. So we got, we did something a little different. We got something done for a tiny, tiny fraction of what it was supposed to cost and we had it open in three and a half, four months and it's now our Embassy. It's a great Embassy and it's recognized, Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Sort of a great story.”","analysis":"The new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem for about $400,000. (Trump sometimes claims it cost $500,000.) U.S. government documents <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usaspending.gov/#/award/67072609\">show</a> the overall cost for the conversion now totals more than $23 million. Costs for the permanent embassy could well surpass $1 billion when all is said and done.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"10/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
