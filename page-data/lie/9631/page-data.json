NOTHING WILL EVER SATISFY THEM!”","analysis":"Trump goes back and forth on whether special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s nearly 400-page report on Russian interference in the 2016 election and potential obstruction of justice by the president should be released to the public.\n\nOn March 16, after the House voted 420 to 0 to release the report, Trump tweeted: “I told leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency. Makes us all look good and doesn't matter.” On March 20, he said “I don't mind” when asked whether the public has a right to see the Mueller report. “I mean, frankly, I told the House, ‘If you want, let them see it,’ ” Trump said.\n\nBut maybe he does mind. On April 2, Trump brought up old comments from Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who opposed the full release of independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s report on President Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky. “It’s grand jury material. It represents statements which may or may not be true by various witnesses. Salacious material. All kinds of material that it would be unfair to release,” Nadler said in 1998. But Nadler went on to say he was open to making public at least some of the report that had already been given to Congress.\n\nNow Trump is in the White House, and Nadler has changed his tune, the president suggests.\n\nBut there are some key differences here. Starr delivered his full, unredacted report to Congress in 1998, complete with grand jury testimony. Congress debated how much of the report to release to the public.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
