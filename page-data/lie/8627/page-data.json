In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.”","analysis":"For San Diego, Trump’s comparison goes back 23 years, to 1992, when a wall went up in that border area.

In fiscal 2017, CBP reported nearly 304,000. That’s an 81.5 percent decline overall. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the San Diego fence that Trump mentioned, by itself, “did not have a discernible impact on the influx of unauthorized aliens coming across the border.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
