We're at 53, and they say 53 plus maybe 10. A lot of people say that, because you add about 10 percent to the Trump polls because some people don't want to talk; they just want to go out and do it, and they know what's good.”","analysis":"Trump cited a daily tracking poll for Sept. 24 that found he had a 51 percent approval rating by Rasmussen, which consistently has a Republican-leaning bias. The polling gurus at FiveThirtyEight say that an adjusted rating would have shown Trump at 45 percent in the poll. On the day of the tweet, Trump had an average approval of 42.4 percent in 538's blended poll rating, along with 53.7 percent disapproval. Every president since Carter had polled higher at this point in their presidency.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"28021, 28137, 28281, 27049, 24988, 25134, 24708, 24589, 24162, 22040, 21007, 21543, 22136, 21343, 21760, 21383, 21375, 17861, 16957, 16988, 16602, 16060, 15896, 15017, 15761, 15627, 14218, 13760, 13196, 12807, 12813, 12924, 11473, 11148, 11008, 10315, 10124, 9914, 9664, 9480, 9307, 8913, 8812, 8858, 8676, 8683, 8708, 8606, 7267, 7545, 7006, 5561, 5317, 4738, 2726, 2685, 2625, 2281, 1870, 1492, 0662, 0667, 0665, 0087","repeated_count":"64","date":"09/24/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
