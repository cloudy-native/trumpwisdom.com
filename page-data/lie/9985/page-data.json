And that's just in a very short period of time.”","analysis":"A local television station <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2019/04/17/reality-check-president-donald-trump-minnesota-tax-day-visit/\">looked into this claim</a> and said it was false and out of context. \"According to the Minnesota Secretary of State’s Office, which monitors business filings: In 2017, there were 67,008 total business filings. In 2018, there were 70,308.\" That's about a five percent increase. Statewide, new filings were down 2.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. The report said you only get close to 20 percent if you compare the fourth quarter of 2017 with the first quarter of 2018. The White House said it relied on data from the Census Bureau’s Business Formation Statistics (BFS) which tracks new business applications via applications for Employer Identification Numbers (EINs), using a four-quarter moving average. This shows an increase of 18 percent from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2018, so the administration is counting from start of Trump's presidency. The data provided from the White House showed business applications in Minnesota had been flat since 2011. \n","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
