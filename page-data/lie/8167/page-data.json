You catch them and then you release them. What kind of stuff is this? If they want to do something with that, it would be all right.”","analysis":"The United States releases some unauthorized immigrants while they wait for immigration hearings because there's no space to house all of them for prolonged periods of time. Justice Department data show that the majority of these immigrants show up for their immigration hearings. It's important to note that catch-and-release is primarily for asylum-seekers and children. Immigrants with criminal records are ineligible. Official statistics show 85 percent of deportations are ordered quickly, without hearings before judges or temporary release into the country.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26946, 26835, 26671, 27144, 26210, 26327, 25697, 25568, 25438, 25356, 24434, 24097, 23680, 21591, 22455, 18863, 17785, 16549, 16205, 16476, 16347, 14676, 12687, 11639, 11954, 11939, 11899, 11850, 11141, 11719, 10877, 10263, 10006, 9890, 9645, 9705, 9536, 9297, 9140, 9141, 8852, 8451, 8498, 8324, 8280, 8167, 8195, 8216, 8217, 8223, 7891, 7893, 7910, 7911, 7912, 7148, 7077, 7078, 7079, 7081, 6537, 6557, 6644, 6202, 6386, 6161, 6425, 6486, 5899, 5818, 4401, 4288, 4525, 3892, 3460, 3847, 3945, 3955, 3917, 3936, 3318, 3270, 3202, 3172, 3122, 3083, 2816, 2829, 2695","repeated_count":"89","date":"01/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
