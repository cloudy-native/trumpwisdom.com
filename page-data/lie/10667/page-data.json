I didn't have to give any of it. We gave it.”","analysis":"In many ways, Trump has been one of the least transparent presidents. Unlike George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Trump refused to sit for an interview with the special counsel. He only responded to written questions, many of which he responded: \"I do not recall.\" Trump has also refused to release his taxes, unlike every president since Gerald Ford. The White House ended the tradition of releasing visitor logs. His administration has largely ended press briefings at the White House, State Department and the Pentagon. The White House has refused to answer oversight inquiries from House Democrats, including allowing testimony by key officials.
