It is called the ‘chicken tax.’ If we did that with cars coming in, many more cars would be built here..... .....and G.M. would not be closing their plants in Ohio, Michigan & Maryland. Get smart Congress. Also, the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the U.S. for decades. The President has great power on this issue - Because of the G.M. event, it is being studied now!”","analysis":"This is not how the North American automaker industry works. Since NAFTA was adopted in the 1990s, the U.S., Canada and Mexico have become an integrated auto market. When a car is built in North America, each country makes certain parts, and they flow freely across the borders without tariffs. This means each country gets a cut of the business when a car assembled in North America is sold. Because of these long-standing dynamics, Trump's claim that more cars would be built in the U.S. simply by imposing a 25 percent tariff is nonsense.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/28/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
