Next up is the U.S. Post Office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their “delivery boy” for a BIG percentage of their packages … In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon. Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?”","analysis":"Amazon chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos has owned The Washington Post since 2013 as a personal investment. The two companies operate independently of each other. The Post has been profitable for the last two years. Amazon charged sales taxes in every state with a sales tax before the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair in June. The company also offered to charge sales taxes for third-party vendors selling products through Amazon.com before the court’s decision. The U.S. Postal Service gives Amazon bulk-shipping rates and says its relationship with Amazon is profitable.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30129, 30525, 27637, 27310, 25967, 24707, 14192, 13343, 12475, 9752, 9919, 8272, 5074, 5150, 4889, 4949, 4950, 4629, 4474, 3642, 4212, 4183, 4142, 3103, 1992, 1727, 1289, 1238, 1065, 0978, 0747, 0746, 0743, 0335, 0163, 0106, 0077, 0050, 0035","repeated_count":"39","date":"07/23/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
