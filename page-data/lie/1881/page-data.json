But a lot has to do with the wording of the question, with support growing to majority approval if respondents are told more details about how it works. Trump here scales back his previous claim that he essentially repealed the ACA; it is possible that elimination of the mandate will undermine the law. The repeal does not take effect until 2019.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/26/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
