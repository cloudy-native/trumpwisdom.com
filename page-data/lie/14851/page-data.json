But I said, 'Why are you being so kind?' 'Well, sir, she's a woman. We have to be nice.' She's very tough. I've heard bad things. And by the way, when I was talking to President Zelensky, it's right on the phone. You can read it. He didn't like her. He brought up her name, and he didn't like her at all. How do you have an ambassador when the president, the new president, does not? Because she was so wedded in.”","analysis":"Trump has it backwards. He criticized ousted Ambassador Marie ­Yovanovitch first, and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, seemingly under pressure, said he agreed, according to a rough transcript of the July 25 conversation released by the White House. “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that,” Trump says. This came seemingly out of the blue. It was in the middle of two requests Trump made of Zelensky that are being investigated as part of the House impeachment inquiry. Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate a conspiracy theory involving a Democratic server, Ukraine and the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike; then he threw in the criticism of Yovanovitch; then he asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. Zelensky was inaugurated the day Yovanovitch left Ukraine for good. He replied to Trump: “It was great that you were the first one who told me that she was a bad ambassador because I agree with you 100%.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"18211, 14851, 15250, 13901, 15034","repeated_count":"5","date":"11/22/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
