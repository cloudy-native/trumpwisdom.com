And they say you had the largest water dump ever. It just didn't stop. It came in, and you thought it was gone, and then it went back out and it reloaded, right? And it happened three times. And your governor came, and he wanted to build a barrier so that water would hit the barrier, it wouldn't come into certain parts of Texas. He called me, he said, 'Sir, I just have one more request.' This is after we gave $28 billion. So, $28 billion. I mean, we watch the pennies, but when it comes to Texas, we don't watch them too closely, okay?”","analysis":"Trump is mixing together a few different pieces of the same story. The Houston Chronicle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Trump-says-Texas-made-a-fortune-on-14544214.php\">reported</a>, “Since Hurricane Ike hit Texas in 2008, state and federal officials have been studying the idea of a 70-mile coastal barrier aimed at protecting Houston’s shipping channel from hurricanes. Often called the Ike Dike, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has estimated it could cost up to $31 billion to build.” But there’s a difference between that study and accomplishing a barrier.
