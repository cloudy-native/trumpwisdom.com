The total military budget peaked in 2010 at $774 billion. Since 2011, the base budget of the military budget is capped by the Budget Control Act which aims to reduce the deficit by reigning in federal spending. Without changes to the BCA caps the base military budget can only increase within a pre-designated range. Spending on overseas contingency operations is not constrained by the BCA, but it is unlikely OCO spending will increase over war-time spending.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
