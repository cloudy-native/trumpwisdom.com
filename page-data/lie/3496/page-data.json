They were all coming in from China and putting our companies out of business and not high quality, either. It was not what we want.

The Solar Energy Industries Association estimated that 23,000 net jobs would be lost in the first year of Trump’s tariff, and tens of thousands more in the following three years before it expires.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"3594, 4062, 3445, 3496, 2767, 2751, 2540, 2752, 2753, 2754, 2203","repeated_count":"11","date":"06/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
