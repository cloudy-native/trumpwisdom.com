It is possibly the greatest political movement anywhere.”","analysis":"Trump has been questioned about this claim. The abolitionist movement, the civil rights movement, the women's suffrage movement, the anti-fascist movement during World War II, the anti-Apartheid movement and the global human rights movement all come to mind, just to name a few. Trump's case would be stronger had he won the popular vote in 2016 -- or was re-elected in 2020.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"31583, 31234, 30315, 29939, 31235, 31236, 31237, 7370, 6714, 31239, 31241, 31238, 31240, 31242, 31243, 31244, 6167","repeated_count":"17","date":"10/31/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
