Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!”","analysis":"There are slew of falsehoods in this tweet. First of all, FBI agents did not \"break into\" Michael Cohen's office. They were executing a search order that had been approved by a federal judge. In New York state, only one party needs consent to a recording. That means it is not illegal for a lawyer to record a client. As for Cohen taping Trump, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-allies-worry-that-federal-investigators-may-have-seized-recordings-made-by-his-attorney/2018/04/12/16d6345a-3e89-11e8-912d-16c9e9b37800_story.html?utm_term=.eb5df7ce023d\">The Post reported in April</a>, it was a regular practice of Cohen's that Trump knew about. Lastly, Trump is not America's \"favorite President.\" At the time of this tweet, his approval rating had dipped to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/\">42 percent</a>.
