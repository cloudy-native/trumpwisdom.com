Now that they are going up, he tries to flip the script and say the rise also shows he is stemming illegal immigration. There is no evidence another president would have been any more or less effective on immigration. Generally, apprehensions have sharply declined since their peak in the early 2000s.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
