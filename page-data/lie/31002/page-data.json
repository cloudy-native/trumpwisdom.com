Biden denied a number of specific false allegations that Trump raised -- that his son Hunter received $3.5 million from the wife of the Moscow mayor, that he was \"given\" tens of millions of dollars, that he had no job before Biden became vice president, that he was dishonorably discharged from the military -- but he was never asked about a possible tax investigation of Hunter Biden. (The  probe was not public at the time because activity in the investigation had gone covert in recent months due to Justice Department guidelines prohibiting overt actions that could affect an election.) \"My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem. He’s overtaking it. He’s fixed it. He’s worked on it. And I'm proud of him, I'm proud of my son,\" Biden said at the debate.
