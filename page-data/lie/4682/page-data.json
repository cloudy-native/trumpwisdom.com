'It is astonishing that the FISA courts couldn’t hold hearings on Spy Warrants targeting Donald Trump. It isn’t about Carter Page, it’s about the Trump Campaign. You’ve got corruption at the DOJ & FBI. The leadership.... ....of the DOJ & FBI are completely out to lunch in terms of exposing and holding those accountable who are responsible for that corruption.' @TomFitton @JudicialWatch”","analysis":"This is not how the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court works. The duty judge doesn't normally hold a hearing for an application for a warrant. The judge instead usually decides whether to grant a warrant based on written submissions laying out probable cause. It's the same standard used in courts across the country. The {FBI's initial application} to monitor Page said \"the FBI believes that the Russian Government's efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with [Trump's] campaign\" and that \"Page has established relationships with Russian Government officials, including Russian intelligence officers.\" A judge granted the application, and other judges later extended the warrant, finding probable cause at each step. In any case, the FISA application makes clear that the FBI requested Page’s wiretap after it was announced he had left the Trump campaign.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/01/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
