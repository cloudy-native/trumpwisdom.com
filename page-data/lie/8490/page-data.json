Notice how Trump switches quickly from the total for arrests over two years (266,000) to the total for charges and convictions: “100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 homicides.” These numbers for arrests and charges are apples and oranges. By switching from one to the other, Trump confuses the issue and exaggerates the criminality. In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, and not all charges result in convictions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26673, 9553, 9265, 9134, 8783, 8738, 8625, 8490, 7809, 7764","repeated_count":"10","date":"01/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
