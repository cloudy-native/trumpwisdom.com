They're going to be buying $250 billion worth of goods and $50 billion from our farmers.”","analysis":"Trump often says China committed to buy $250 billion in goods from the United States as part of his trade deal, but the figure is $200 billion over two years compared to a 2017 baseline. That $200 billion figure includes the purchase of farm products, which Trump incorrectly hypes as $50 billion -- it's $32 billion -- so Trump often mistakenly combines the two numbers. In this instance, he took the incorrect $250 billion and added the (incorrect) farm number for a second time. The Chinese have indicated these are aspirational numbers, not written in stone as Trump implies, and certainly the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on buying patterns is unclear.
