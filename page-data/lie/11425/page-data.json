In the State Department, one of Mike's people said -- the woman that we respect, who's been in charge of Mexico for 20 years -- she laughed when we said we were going to ask for these things. She said, \"They've been trying to get\" [Mexico to stop migration to the U.S.]-- she was there for 20 years. But they've been trying to get it for 45 or 50 years, the things that I asked for. And they all laughed. I got it done in one day. Because I said, \"If you don't do it, we're going to put tariffs on.\" ”","analysis":"Trump is referring to Mexico's decision to place nearly 20,000 troops along its southern and northern borders to tamp down immigration flows from Central America to the United States. But Trump's claim that the U.S. has sought this change for over 20 years makes little sense. The Central American migration phenomenon began in 2014. And Mexico for decades has apprehended and deported Central Americans at rates that rival those of the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"11377, 11425, 11452, 11440, 11890, 11252, 11819","repeated_count":"7","date":"07/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
