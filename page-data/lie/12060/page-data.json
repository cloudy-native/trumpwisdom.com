The organizations he mentions did find that Hillary Clinton had a slight advantage over Trump leading up to the 2016 election. It was a very close race and Clinton, it should be noted, won the popular vote by 2.1 percentage points.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
