If instead of 14 million tests we did 3 million -- like, Germany is at about 3 million; South Korea is at 3 million, and they've done a very good job. It's not a knock, but we're at almost 14 million. We're going to be passing 14 million very soon.”","analysis":"No, the main reason the United States had more cases is that the virus was spreading. Another contributing cause was U.S. officials' halting response during critical early weeks. Some countries for months had a higher per capita testing rate than the United States -- Germany, for example, yet Trump here misleadingly uses raw numbers. (Germany and South Korea have much smaller populations than the 350 million or so in the United States.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
