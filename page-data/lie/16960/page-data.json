Everything having to do with this fraudulent investigation is badly tainted and, in my opinion, should be thrown out. Even Mueller’s statement to Congress that he did not see me to become the FBI Director (again), has been proven false. The whole deal was a total SCAM. If I wasn’t President, I’d be suing everyone all over the place. BUT MAYBE I STILL WILL. WITCH HUNT!”","analysis":"Trump stirs up a witch's stew of invective here. There is no evidence that Mueller lied to Congress about wanting to be FBI director again; even Trump's aides said the allegation was silly. Among its many convictions of Trump aides for malfeasance, the Mueller investigation uncovered a sophisticated hacking operation by a unit responsible for intelligence collection for the Russian military.
