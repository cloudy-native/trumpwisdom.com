Security Council declared “null and void and without international legal effect.” No president has campaigned to formally support the annexation. Before Trump. U.S. policy had been to support the ongoing quid pro quo between Israel and Syria around the Golan Heights, with diplomatic efforts in the Clinton and Obama administrations to resolve the dispute in a satisfactory manner for both countries. Trump often suggests that he managed to accomplish something in the works for a half-century, but the action he took was never contemplated by any previous American administration.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29844, 30036, 30308, 30537, 29250, 29387, 29453, 29640, 29547, 29717, 29968, 29048, 28677, 28465, 28221, 27375, 27374, 26630, 27485, 27196, 27333, 27518, 27379, 27376, 27377, 27378, 27381, 27380, 27382, 27383, 23488, 17854, 17420, 14407, 11209, 10044, 9559, 9591, 9458","repeated_count":"39","date":"09/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
