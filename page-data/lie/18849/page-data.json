But the same could be said about Trump in this period, who repeatedly praised China’s “transparency” and handling of the outbreak. Here are some examples:\n\nJan. 24, Twitter: “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!”\nJan. 30, remarks at a campaign rally: “Maybe we've never had a better relationship [with China], and we’re working with them very closely on the coronavirus. We’re working with them very, very closely. We only have five people [infected]. Hopefully everything’s going to be great. They have somewhat of a problem, but hopefully it’s all going to be great.”\nFeb. 7, remarks to reporters: “Late last night, I had a very good talk with President Xi, and we talked about — mostly about the coronavirus. They're working really hard, and I think they are doing a very professional job. They're in touch with World — the World — World Organization. CDC also. We’re working together. But World Health is working with them. CDC is working with them. I had a great conversation last night with President Xi. It’s a tough situation. I think they're doing a very good job.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
