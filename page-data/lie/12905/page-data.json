I was sued by him. He's a do-nothing. Sued by him so that I can't get on the ballot in the state of California. It was a massive story. It was the biggest story, Mr. President. It was headlines all over the place: 'Trump gets sued by this do-nothing governor in California.' It was big. Here's what happened: Yesterday, I won the case, very convincingly. A very tough, smart, highly respected judge -- not a Trump person at all -- not appointed by Trump; appointed by somebody that you would call the opposition -- came out with a scathing and tough opinion. I won the case. I didn't see one story that I won that case -- not one story -- from the fake news.”","analysis":"Trump's legal victory was widely covered in the news media.
