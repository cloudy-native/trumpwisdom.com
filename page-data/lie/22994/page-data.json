They bailed them right out of jail.

The vast majority of people — 92 percent — had to pay no bail. So Trump is wrong to suggest that the donations by either Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) or Biden campaign staff led to the release of many protesters or rioters.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"28943, 28826, 26645, 27080, 27253, 25875, 24845, 24627, 24399, 23098, 22404, 22994","repeated_count":"12","date":"08/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
