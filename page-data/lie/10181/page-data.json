But they hadn't hit these numbers in 16 years.”","analysis":"Trump mixes up a bunch of things here. The economy achieved an unexpected 3.2 percent growth rate in the first quarter. But higher quarterly growth rates for the gross domestic product were achieved in 2018 (and also under President Barack Obama). Trump's reference to \"16 years\" appears to be referring to an old, discredited claim for the annual growth rate for gross domestic product in 2018. Trump used to claim it was the best in 14 years, but that was inaccurate. It was the best growth rate in four years -- at least until the Commerce Department revised the figure downward. With the revision, there were no bragging rights at all. As for calling for quantitative easing, the Federal Reserve adopted that policy when it could no longer lower interest rates beyond zero after the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, with unemployment reaching 10 percent. The economy is now basically at full employment.
