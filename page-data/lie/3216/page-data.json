In Libya, we decimated that country. That country was decimated. There was no deal to keep Gaddafi. The Libyan model that was mentioned was a much different deal. This would be with Kim Jong-un -- something where he'd be there, he'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich. His people are tremendously industrious. ... I think when John Bolton made that statement, he was talking about if we're going to be having a problem because we cannot let that country have nukes. We just can't do it. So that's the way it meant. It's really just the opposite.”","analysis":"National Security Adviser John Bolton had indicated the United States was looking at the Libya model of nuclear disarmament as a potential path in negotiations with North Korea. But the North Koreans have angrily rejected the Libya model as too extreme and blasted Bolton for his comments. Trump has the last word on these negotiations, but it's worth noting that his and Bolton's comments were in conflict.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/17/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
