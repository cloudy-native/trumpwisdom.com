It wasn't to their advantage to say that.”","analysis":"Trump often gets this statistic wrong. In 2015, there was the biggest percentage jump in a single year since 1970-1971, or 45 years ago. It was not the highest rate in 45 or 47 years. Overall, the rate of homicides and violent crimes are back down to the levels they were 45 years ago, and are at about half the rates at their peak in the 1980s and early 1990s.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/07/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
