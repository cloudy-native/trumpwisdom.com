The current practice of leaving town while conducting phony pro forma sessions is a dereliction of duty that the American people cannot afford during this crisis. It is a scam, what they do. It's a scam, and everybody knows it. And it's been that way for a long time. And perhaps it's never done before -- it's never been done before; nobody is even sure if it has. But we're going to do it. We need these people here. We need people for this crisis, and we don't want to play any more political games.”","analysis":"Trump demanded that Congress adjourn so that he can make recess appointments—temporary appointments permissible when the Senate is recessed. But whether he has the power to adjourn Congress is disputed. Article 2, Section 3 of the Constitution does give the president some power to adjourn Congress, but under specific circumstances: “he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.”  The House and Senate already had a date set for January 3, 2021, for their formal adjournment, so for Trump's gambit to work, the GOP-controlled Senate would need to seek to change that. That would be all but impossible, as it would require the Senate to defeat a motion to end debate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
