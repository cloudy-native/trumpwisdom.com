I want them to make they do a big part of their platform. No more airplanes, no more cows. One car per family....And we had a problem because when they didn't want the airplanes they were saying well, how do you get to Europe?”","analysis":"In reality, the Green New Deal resolution has no teeth and wouldn’t become law if it passed. So these claims are based on a retracted FAQ about a nonbinding resolution. In these documents, proponents of the Green New Deal mused about ending air travel. Problematic as those lines were, none made it into the resolution. High-speed rail would become an airplane alternative for some travelers under the terms of the Green New Deal, but it wouldn’t end commercial air travel. Travelers who prefer flights over high-speed rail would still have a choice. As for cows, Trump is referring to a line in the FAQ intended to be an ironic reference to the impact of cow emissions.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30947, 29481, 29087, 28444, 27661, 28858, 28016, 28106, 28265, 27801, 27628, 26956, 26628, 27085, 27336, 26371, 26396, 26095, 26159, 25530, 25163, 26539, 26002, 24409, 24184, 24091, 23465, 23117, 22449, 22292, 22908, 20867, 21903, 22691, 21514, 20053, 20282, 18570, 16839, 16210, 16441, 15705, 14141, 13650, 12759, 11047, 11792, 10486, 10513, 10887, 10264, 10171, 9883, 9712, 9531, 9588, 9075, 9128, 9043, 8730, 8670","repeated_count":"61","date":"03/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
