The claim that Biden's plan would cause household income to decline by $6,500 a year is fiction. The number comes from a report co-written by President Trump’s former chief economic adviser, so it’s clearly designed for campaign weaponization. The $6,500-figure is an estimate for 2030, a decade in the future — not even during a theoretical two-term Biden presidency -- and is disputed by other, more reputable analyses.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"29593, 30101, 28693, 27954, 28194, 27012, 26802, 26855, 26636, 26713, 27084","repeated_count":"11","date":"10/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
