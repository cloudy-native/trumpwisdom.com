Several measures of economic recovery show that the U.S. has fallen behind China and several other major countries during the coronavirus pandemic. The United States had an unemployment rate of 7.9 percent in October, compared to an average of 7.4 percent for other developed countries, whose jobless rate averages 7.4 percent, according to the latest data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. (Netherlands, Germany, South Korea and Japan had unemployment rates of 4.6 percent to 3 percent.) China leads the world with reported growth in gross domestic product of 11.5 percent last quarter over the same quarter last year. The U.S. lags far behind, at minus 9 percent. Inflation in the U.S., a measurement of price increases for consumers, stands at 4.6 percent, compared to an average of 3.9 percent for other OECD countries. And while Trump constantly brags about the stock market, Japan's stock market, as reflected by the Nikkei index, has done better in 2020. Trump sometimes adds the U.S. had the smallest contraction of \"any major Western country. The Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden did better and are certainly major Western countries. Taiwan and South Korea <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/covid-health-economy\">were by far the best performers</a> but maybe Trump does not consider them \"Western\"? We're not sure, but either way, he's spinning.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"31593, 30922, 31571, 29759, 29905, 30136, 30227, 29261, 29318, 29393, 29684, 29691, 29743, 28884, 28947, 28616, 28453, 28020, 28097, 28127, 27987, 27832, 27553, 27477, 27554, 27555, 27556, 27552, 27557","repeated_count":"29","date":"10/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
