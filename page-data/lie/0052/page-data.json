And we put the money up, and we have really nothing to show for it.”","analysis":"The payment was connected to a $1.7 billion settlement of claims with Iran announced by the State Department, in which $400 million was always Iran’s money. (The rest was negiotiated interest.) In the 1970s, the then-pro-Western Iranian government under the shah paid $400 million for U.S. military equipment. But the equipment was never delivered because the two countries broke off relations after the seizure of American hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Iran. Trump says the United States has nothing to show for it, but the money was transferred on the same day four Americans being held in Iran were released, though the Obama administration denied there was any connection.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/05/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
