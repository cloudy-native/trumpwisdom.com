It's called a manifesto. You know why it's called a manifesto? Because this is beyond socialism. This is a word that starts with a C [communism], not an S, that's where they're coming from. That's what they're coming from.”","analysis":"Trump often claims that Biden swung far to the left after winning the Democratic presidential nomination, pointing to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://joebiden.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/UNITY-TASK-FORCE-RECOMMENDATIONS.pdf\">a set of recommendations</a> issued by a task force made up of Biden advisers and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The problem? The recommendations are much more moderate than Sanders's positions were, and Biden has said he will consider them but that they are not his official positions. For example, the recommendations do not call for Sanders's \"Medicare-for-all\" plan -- instead, they mirror Biden's plan: an expansion of the Affordable Care Act.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"30279, 29707, 29954, 30122, 27842, 26670, 27500, 26213, 25489, 25164, 25265, 26558, 26021, 26047, 25841, 25921, 24726, 24240, 24077, 23992, 23816, 23641, 23456, 23253, 23109, 20984, 22192, 21333, 22772, 22836, 21237, 22715, 22724, 22752, 22601","repeated_count":"35","date":"09/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
