So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution,... ....which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama’s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer’s liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!”","analysis":"The special counsel continues to investigate, and no conclusions have been announced on whether the Trump campaign illegally coordinated with Russia in 2016. Trump also characterizes Michael Cohen's campaign finance violations on behalf of Trump's campaign as \"a simple private transaction\" or a civil legal matter. But prosecutors and judges decide these kinds of things, and in this case, prosecutors and the judge overseeing Cohen's case have already determined that these were illegal campaign contributions meriting criminal charges.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"9222, 9205, 8144, 7753, 7626, 7595, 7596, 7597, 7599, 7600, 7603, 7618, 7619, 7592, 7265, 7296","repeated_count":"16","date":"12/10/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
