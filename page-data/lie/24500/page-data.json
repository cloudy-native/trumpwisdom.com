It's a disaster. Everyone knows it. Everyone knows it's a disaster.”","analysis":"Trump has to know -- as anyone who has ever watched live election results does -- that early trends showing one candidate in the lead can change during the course of the counting. Some Republican-heavy precincts reported earlier than Democratic precincts, and mail votes were all counted even later in several swing states. The upshot, as experts had been explaining for months, was that Trump appeared to be in the lead early on in some states, but lost them in the end as more Biden votes came in. This is how elections work, but Trump suggests it's nefarious because he resents having lost.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
