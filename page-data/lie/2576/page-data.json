The Republican majority offered preliminary conclusions, released in a one-page summary of a draft 150-page report, which said they found “no evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy” between the Trump campaign and Russia. Democrats on the committee have said that the investigation was incomplete and that key witnesses had not been interviewed.
