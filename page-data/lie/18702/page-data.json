You had people in that group … There were people in that rally — and I looked the night before — if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people — neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them. But you had a lot of people in that group that were there to innocently protest, and very legally protest.”","analysis":"On the night of Aug. 11, the \"night before,\" neo-Nazi and white-supremacist groups marched on the campus of the University of Virginia, carrying flaming torches and chanting anti-Semitic slogans. Trump assumed there were peaceful protestors, but there were only neo-Nazis and white supremacists in the Friday night rally. It’s possible Trump became confused and was really referring to the Saturday rallies. But he asserted there were people who were not alt-right who were “very quietly” protesting the removal of Lee’s statue. But that’s wrong. There were white supremacists. There were counter protesters. And there were heavily armed anti-government militias who showed up on Saturday, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/08/very-fine-people-charlottesville-who-were-they-2/\">according to a Fact Checker investigation</a>. The militia groups were not spurred on by the Confederate statue controversy. They arrived in Charlottesville heavily armed and, by their own account, were prepared to use deadly force — because of a desire to insert themselves in a dangerous situation that, in effect, pitted them against the foes of white supremacists.\n\n","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"26291, 25764, 22472, 10127, 10214, 18702","repeated_count":"6","date":"08/15/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
