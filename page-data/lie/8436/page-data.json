But we have a wall. It's an old wall. It's not a good wall, and it still works.”","analysis":" For San Diego, Trump's comparison goes back 23 years, to 1992, when a wall went up in that border area. But the apprehension numbers also are down as a general matter and in border sections without these barriers. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials reported 1.6 million southwest border apprehensions for fiscal 2000. In fiscal 2017, CBP reported nearly 304,000. That’s an 81.5 percent decline overall. (Border apprehensions have been rising this year.)
