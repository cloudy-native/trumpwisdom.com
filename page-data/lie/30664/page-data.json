The all Democrat County Commissioner race, on same ballot as President, just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy. Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security. Major impact!”","analysis":"There was no “big victory.”\n\nTrump tweeted this over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamLaxalt/status/1328473113504354305\">a tweet</a> by one of his lawyers in Nevada, Adam Laxalt, who wrote that “the Clark County Commission just threw out an election that represents almost 1/6 of the total votes cast in Clark County because there were too many ‘discrepancies’ to be sure that that the results in that election can be certain.” But if Trump had read more deeply into <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/meganmesserly/status/1328443530696552448\">the Twitter thread</a> on which Laxalt was commenting, he would have seen that this involved only the Clark County Commission District C race. Just 10 votes separated the two candidates, with the Republican behind. There were enough questions about various ballots, such as possible double votes, to make a difference in this race. “It is common practice in the county to report election discrepancies,” {noted the Las Vegas-Review Journal}. “Of nearly 975,000 votes cast for all races countywide, there were 936 issues identified, according to [Registrar of Voters Joe] Gloria, not enough to doubt the results of other contests.” It’s possible another election for the commissioner slot will be arranged.\n\nThe 936 discrepancies make up .096 percent of total ballots cast in Clark County in this year’s election, noted the Nevada Independent. Even the campaign for the Republican in the race, Stavros Anthony, distanced itself from Trump’s tweet: The campaign manager told the Independent that Anthony “has never subscribed to the conspiracy side of that” with regard to the discrepancies. “What we've consistently talked about is human error,” she said. “I don't care if you're counting ballots or making pizzas, there’s going to be errors.”\n\nThe results in all of the other races were certified, including the presidential election. Trump was behind by more than 33,000 votes in the state. Clark County has 72 percent of the state’s population.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/16/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
