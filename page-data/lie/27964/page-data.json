We used to give the Palestinians $750 million dollars a year. And I said, 'Look, we're not gonna pay you. If you're not gonna make a deal, why would we pay?'

It wasn't a terrible thing.”","analysis":"A Congressional Research Service report <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22967.pdf\">from 2018</a> says the U.S. provided $496 million in aid for Palestinians in 2012. The amount of aid steadily declined during Obama's second term. In Fiscal 2019, the U.S. provided $250 million in aid, according to the report. The figure grew to $800 million in 2016 when factoring in direct aid to the Palestinian Authority and the United Nations' Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/fact-check-how-much-funding-does-u-s-actually-give-palestinians-1.5630320\">according to Haaretz</a>. Either way, Trump's number is way off. Trump has sharply reduced aid to the Palestinians but U.S. assistance has not been entirely eliminated.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
