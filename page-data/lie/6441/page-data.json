Now, they're starting to go up.”","analysis":"The price of soybeans has not dropped 50 percent since five years before the election, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. In 2011, five years before the 2016 election, soybeans peaked at $13.40 per bushel. In May 2018, soybeans cost $9.84 per bushel. That’s a 27 percent drop. Measuring since 2011, the lowest price was $8.56 in March 2016. Tariffs and trade barriers are not pushing these prices down; record soybean plantings and record yields are the cause.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"10216, 6441, 5335, 5291, 5703, 4980, 4995, 5017, 4436","repeated_count":"9","date":"10/27/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
