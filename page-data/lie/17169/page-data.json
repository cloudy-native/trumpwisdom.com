Trump, unlike many presidents in his four years, had signed relatively few major pieces of legislation. Certainly, the whirlwind of accomplishments under presidents such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama exceed Trump’s efforts during his first three years, but then the stimulus bills passed after the pandemic shut down the United States in his 4th year are significant. As of Dec. 30, 2020, his 1441st day, Trump had signed 702 bills, most of which were minor. Trump has signed more bills and joint resolutions than Obama, but was still behind every other president since Eisenhower, according to a calculation provided to The Fact Checker by Josh Tauberer of GovTrack. “What matters is the content of the legislation,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://govtrackinsider.com/the-115th-congress-in-review-76efbaadf03d\">he wrote at the end of 2018</a>. “When you look at the actual policy, the 115th Congress was underwhelming.” Trump's numbers are also driven largely by his first two years, when both chambers of Congress were held by Republicans. The rate of new laws has dropped precipitously since the start of 2019. But at the same time, the bills signed by Trump exceed every president but Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush in terms of page count, Tauberer said. \"But what he's done --- most of it increasing the size of the federal government in Democrat-led legislation -- goes against the regulation-cutting and swamp-draining philosophy that he and the Republican Party campaigned on.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"30995, 30776, 29278, 29902, 30465, 29265, 29700, 29737, 30016, 28894, 28920, 28680, 28493, 28756, 28830, 27698, 27055, 27248, 27289, 26341, 26407, 26241, 26269, 26088, 25731, 25499, 25447, 25349, 25277, 26063, 24883, 24779, 24667, 24561, 24349, 24367, 24296, 24242, 23977, 23853, 23657, 23442, 23570, 23150, 23153, 21989, 22054, 22387, 20930, 23025, 22154, 22188, 21051, 21314, 22813, 22871, 22667, 20918, 20831, 21640, 21430, 20694, 20736, 20591, 20436, 20023, 19936, 19911, 20309, 19425, 19312, 18803, 18768, 18935, 18637, 18055, 17621, 17558, 17480, 17169, 17284, 16931, 17147, 18236, 17138, 16867, 16779, 16660, 16423, 16300, 15978, 14802, 13847, 15458, 14295, 14177, 13940, 13766, 13888, 13592, 13446, 13470, 12953, 13224, 13702, 13729, 12993, 12728, 13325, 13337, 12776, 12468, 12270, 12259, 12139, 11333, 12084, 11367, 12237, 11237, 11830, 11833, 11853, 11770, 11150, 10935, 10122, 9732, 9497, 9276, 9175, 8982, 9038, 8946, 8691, 8446, 8364, 8309, 8203, 8015, 8143, 7987, 7844, 7854, 7281, 7605, 7275, 7401, 6718, 6870, 7136, 6142, 5949, 5503, 5084, 5163, 5068, 4824, 4843, 4935, 4943, 4961, 4763, 4371, 3582, 3982, 4020, 3500, 3927, 16816, 3282, 2974, 2934, 2038, 1823, 1942, 1849, 1918, 1869, 1686, 1665, 1544, 1563, 1494, 1074, 1006, 0913, 0955, 0806","repeated_count":"189","date":"02/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
