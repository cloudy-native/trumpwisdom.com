That's what our people are doing. We want a clear and faithful defense of American history, and we want unity. When you level these false charges, you not only slander me, you not only slander the American people, but you slander generations of heroes who gave their lives for America. You slander people much braver and more principle than you. You're slandering the young men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima and those who perished fighting for freedom in the Civil War.”","analysis":"This is an imagined grievance. News organizations are not condemning citizens, consistently labeling them as racist or slandering them for supporting Confederate symbols and statues. They mostly point out what those symbols and statues represent: A militarized movement to secede from the United States rather than abolish slavery.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/04/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
