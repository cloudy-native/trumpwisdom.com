Republican Congressmen & Congresswomen will hopefully fight hard to defeat it. We must protect and cherish our police, they keep us safe!”","analysis":"Trump's rhetoric is way over the top here in claiming Democrats would \"destroy\" police. There were areas of common ground between Republican and Democratic versions of police reform bills. Both measures include language aimed at stopping officers from using chokeholds, for instance, but the House Democratic bill makes them outright illegal. The Democrats’ bill would effectively end the practice of no-knock warrants, which allow police officers typically working drug cases to enter a house or other premises without announcing their presence. The GOP legislation would require states and localities to report the use of no-knock warrants to the attorney general at the federal level on an annual basis. The attorney general would then publish the information in a public report. Departments that fail to comply would see a 20 percent reduction in their normal federal funding. The biggest difference was over the issue of qualified immunity, which shields police officers from being sued by citizens.
