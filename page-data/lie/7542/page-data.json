A review of the deals shows that many are not concluded and are simply aspirational. Moreover, many of the investments are in Saudi Arabia, making it difficult to argue that these will create many jobs for Americans. Other deals, such as the SoftBank fund and ExxonMobil Chemical deal in Texas, had been announced months earlier and thus are not appropriate for inclusion on a list of achievements from the president’s visit. As for the number of jobs created, many would end up in Saudi Arabia.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"17202, 15050, 13631, 11933, 11250, 10870, 10250, 7307, 7527, 7542, 7248, 7256, 7258, 7231, 6188, 6189, 6205, 6207, 6330, 6331, 6136, 6416, 6420, 6446, 6447, 6125, 6131, 5938, 5939, 5967, 5866, 5870, 5935, 6063, 2706, 0832, 0832, 0704, 0643, 0630, 0618, 0588","repeated_count":"42","date":"11/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
