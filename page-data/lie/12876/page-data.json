Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!”","analysis":"Trump referred to a hyphen when he apparently meant apostrophe. But an apostrophe is used when characters have been taken out of a word — as in “I'm goin’ to the store,” or “Li’l Abner,” or “Lyin’ Ted Cruz.” Liddle’ is missing no letters; it’s just a strange spelling of “little” with a superfluous mark at the end.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
