But he's simply wrong to say the United States inflates the number of deaths, compared to other countries. Many are counting deaths in the same way,\" [reported the BBC</a>. \" Italy counts any death of a patient who has Covid-19 as a death caused by Covid-19; so does Germany and Hong Kong. In the US, doctors have more discretion: they are asked to record whether the patient died 'as a result of this illness' when reporting Covid-19 deaths to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It could be easy to see how a physician might believe that a Covid-19 patient who died of, say, a heart attack or brain aneurysm didn't die as a result of Covid-19, and so wouldn't report accordingly. [But] at present in the US, any death of a Covid-19 patient, no matter what the physician believes to be the direct cause, is counted for public reporting as a Covid-19 death.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/03/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
