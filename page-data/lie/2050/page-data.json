So we're going to take a strong look at that. We want fairness. You can't say things that are false -- knowingly false -- and be able to smile as money pours into your bank account.”","analysis":"Under current libel laws, publishers can be sued if they print articles about public figures that are knowingly false. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1964 unanimously decided that a public figure has to prove an offending statement was made \"with actual malice, that is with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.\" Trump himself has made many false claims about individuals.
