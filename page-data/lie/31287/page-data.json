In so doing, I was fighting to defend American democracy.”","analysis":"It is not credible for Trump to assert he was \"fighting to defend American democracy\" when he continued his efforts to contest the presidential vote after score of his court challenges had failed and the Electoral College had certified Biden as the winner in mid-December. Instead, he encouraged thousands of supporters to come to Washington and he falsely insisted that the vice president take the unlawful act of refusing to accept Biden's electors from key states. That would have disenfranchised millions of votes and greatly undermined U.S. democracy.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/07/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
