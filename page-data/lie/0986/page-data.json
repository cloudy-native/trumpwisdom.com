Among those hit the hardest in recent years have been immigrants and, very importantly, minority workers competing for jobs against brand-new arrivals. And it has not been fair to our people, to our citizens, to our workers.”","analysis":"Low-skilled immigration increased sharply after 1970, but leveled off by the mid-2000s. So he is using outdated data. Overall, there is no evidence that immigration depresses wages or employment of natives, according to a comprehensive study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. Low-skilled immigration did have small — not “substantial” — effects on wages of certain subgroups of native workers, including low-skilled African American workers and some low-skilled Hispanic workers. In the long-term, low- and high-skilled immigration is a net positive to the economy.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"1085","repeated_count":"1","date":"08/02/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
