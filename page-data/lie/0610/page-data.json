Tiny, tiny amount.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to research by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a 2015 report. Researchers found that proposed emissions cuts in the Paris plan would result in about 0.2 degrees (Celsius) less warming by 2100, if the cuts were not extended further. But John Reilly, lead author of the report, said he “disagrees completely” with Trump’s characterization that the 0.2 degree cut is a “tiny, tiny” amount that is not worth pursuing. The intent of the research was to say the Paris deal was a small step, and that more incremental steps need to be taken in the long run.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/01/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
