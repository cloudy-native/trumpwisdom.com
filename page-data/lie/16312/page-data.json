And then, what do I say? I say the United States attorney general. Attorney general of the United States could speak to you would be great, okay? Because it’s known for major corruption. ... I used the word us, us as the United States, our country. ... How many times have you heard it where they say it in a speech, ‘And then the president said, do me a favor.’ Well, that’s not what I said. I said, ‘Do us a favor’ — our country — and then, I said the attorney general of the United States. I didn't say my campaign manager.”","analysis":"Trump is whitewashing what he said to Zelensky. Weeks after the rough transcript of the July 25 call with the Ukrainian president was released, Trump began claiming that when he said “do us a favor” in the call, the word “us” referred to the United States, not himself or his administration. This ex post facto explanation is a real stretch. Trump repeatedly requested that Ukrainian officials meet with his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, whom he didn't mention in these remarks at his Michigan rally. Senior U.S. officials with responsibility over Ukraine matters have said the Biden and CrowdStrike claims Trump wanted investigated were baseless and not in keeping with official U.S. policy.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"16312, 15982, 15859, 15941, 16232, 15214, 15236, 15220, 15219","repeated_count":"9","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
