Same with Late Night Shows. Should Federal Election Commission and/or FCC look into this? There must be Collusion with the Democrats and, of course, Russia! Such one sided media coverage, most of it Fake News.”","analysis":"There is nothing illegal or nefarious about a comedy show making fun of a president. Saturday Night Live has a First Amendment right to skewer the president, as it has done for more than four decades.  Trump assumes comedy shows collude with the Democrats to present one-sided coverage, but those shows have been tough on Democrats when they are in positions of power.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
