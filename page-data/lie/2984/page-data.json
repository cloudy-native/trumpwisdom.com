Here, he adds the oddity of suggesting that Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign aides -- an action criticized by the House Intelligence Committee report -- is actually working at the behest of Russian President Vladimir Putin. That would make the circumstances of the meeting even worse.
