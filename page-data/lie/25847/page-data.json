Democrats had not proposed plans that would reduce Social Security benefits, unlike some Republicans, and in fact many have pushed for greater benefits. When running for re-election in 2020, Trump expanded this to add another falsehood -- that Biden would eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Biden had no such policy and was a strong supporter of such protections. This is a good example of how Trump simply makes up statements that he thinks will sway votes, without paying attention to the actual policies.
