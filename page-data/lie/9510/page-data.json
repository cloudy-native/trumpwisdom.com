There have actually been about 450,000 manufacturing jobs <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES3000000001\">created</a> since he took the oath of office. There has been steady growth in jobs since the Great Recession, though manufacturing job growth had stalled in the year before Trump's election. As for the magic wand reference, {Trump is misquoting Barack Obama}. The former president said in a June 2016 town hall, that \"you're actually seeing some manufacturers coming back to the United States\" but that alone won't help workers whose jobs had been previously outsourced and so \"what we have to do is to make sure that folks are trained for the jobs that are coming in now.\" The \"magic wand\" referred to recreating jobs of the past through negotiating \"a better deal.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"29586, 28747, 25689, 25444, 26586, 24597, 24749, 24698, 23995, 20974, 22429, 22984, 22953, 21831, 21310, 20132, 20302, 20756, 18857, 19537, 18394, 17472, 18260, 16733, 16705, 16336, 15383, 14183, 15831, 14937, 15663, 12822, 12690, 12323, 11643, 12042, 12171, 11894, 11802, 10902, 10237, 9697, 9510, 9182, 8720, 8570, 8293, 8065, 7365, 7396, 6787, 6969, 7159, 6912, 6607, 6762, 7056, 6572, 6308, 6017, 6394, 5906, 5399, 5584, 5625, 5626","repeated_count":"66","date":"03/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
