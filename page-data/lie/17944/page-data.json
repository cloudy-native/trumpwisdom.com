The new coronavirus appears to have a much higher fatality rate than the seasonal flu, possibly 10 times higher, but the outbreak was too new for a firm death rate to be determined. Moreover, it’s a new virus, not yet a seasonal one, although it’s possible covid-19 will become seasonal in the future. The death toll for the seasonal flu is an estimate calculated several years later, as a measure of excess mortality, because the flu often contributes to deaths, while not being recorded as the cause of death.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"19251, 19111, 17923, 17944, 18516, 17950, 17833, 18495, 18479, 17804, 18082, 17766, 17796, 18447","repeated_count":"14","date":"03/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
