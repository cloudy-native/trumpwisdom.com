The use of a helicopter with red cross markings was an abuse of global norms that could help erode its neutral symbolism, military justice experts said. One helicopter buzzed protesters from a height nearly level with three- and four-story buildings in the Chinatown area, ripping tree limbs away. Rotor wash hurled glass from broken windows like shrapnel. Protesters and a few remaining journalists scattered to the sides of the street to seek shelter beneath awnings, or went sprinting away, shouting “I can’t hear!” and “I can’t see!”","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/04/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
