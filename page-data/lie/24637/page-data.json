We had six countries that were current and the -- the amount of current is too low, OK, six countries. I went in and said, 'You've got to pay, sorry, you're delinquent.' They said, 'Really?', 'Yeah. I said you're delinquent, you've got to pay.' Obama would go and make a speech and leave.”","analysis":"During the presidential election, Trump consistently inflated the U.S. contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Once he became president, his inaccuracy has persisted, but with a twist. He often claims that “billions and billions” of dollars have come into NATO because of his complaints. All that is happening is that members have increased defense spending as a share of their economies — a process that was started before Trump even announced his candidacy. In terms of direct funding of NATO, the United States paid the largest share — about 22 percent. Germany is second, with about 15 percent, though Trump sought an agreement to make the payments equal. Trump sometimes suggests NATO members \"owe\" money to the United States or are \"delinquent\" but that is simply not the case. NATO members are supposed to meet a guideline of spending at least two percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024. He also claims NATO spending was at a low point when he came into office, but that's also not true. It had fallen after the end of the Cold War but had started rising sharply after 2014, after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"31587, 29679, 27787, 25395, 24756, 24637, 23788, 23404, 23079, 22087, 22307, 21125, 20811, 20120, 18781, 17719, 17335, 16897, 16644, 16172, 16071, 15010, 14587, 14599, 14670, 15778, 15781, 15787, 15810, 14000, 13618, 13510, 11564, 11411, 11459, 11247, 12249, 10911, 10553, 10557, 10896, 10251, 8359, 8028, 7920, 7928, 7313, 7218, 7488, 7207, 7205, 6226, 6179, 6191, 6406, 6118, 5962, 6098, 6317, 6318, 5361, 5368, 4803, 4821, 4881, 4755, 4767, 4594, 4370, 4586, 4588, 4747, 4748, 4296, 3896, 3733, 3884, 3761, 4188, 4199, 3793, 3804, 3805, 3808, 3626, 3638, 3639, 3779, 4210, 4214, 4215, 3641, 3748, 3751, 3419, 3591, 3646, 3649, 3738, 3740, 3319, 4117, 4118, 4122, 4123, 3600, 3574, 3990, 3402, 3348, 2951, 2785, 2812, 2825, 2839, 2659, 1903, 1873, 1645, 0759, 0761, 0638, 0616, 0598, 0600, 0591, 0592, 0593, 0594, 0524, 0474, 0486, 0422, 0300, 0267, 0256, 0188","repeated_count":"137","date":"09/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
