People that vote, you can't have that national security unless you're going to have voter identification. … If you look, voter identification. So when people show up to vote -- because, if you look, Judicial Watch made a settlement with California, I guess, or Los Angeles, where they found over a million names that was very problematic -- a problem. And you just take a look at that settlement; that's a lot of names. You had people that were well over 100 years old that were voting, but we know they're not around any longer. So, you have a lot of voter fraud. The way you stop it, the easiest way, is voter identification. We have to go and think about that.”","analysis":"Once again, the president is grasping at straws to make bogus claims about alleged voter fraud. Judicial Watch, a conservative group, in 2017 sued the state and Los Angeles County to meet requirements under the National Voter Registration Act to clean up its voter registration files. The group said that the state had not done so for at least two decades and that there were more than 1.5 million registrations on the county’s file of inactive registered voters. In other words, the case had nothing to do with people who had voted — but people who had not voted. The text of settlement did not say there was fraudulent voting or any type voter fraud. There was also no admission of wrongdoing. It simply set up a process for notices to be sent to people found to be inactive.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"22276, 22306, 20410, 19697, 19443, 12465, 12379, 17830","repeated_count":"8","date":"08/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
