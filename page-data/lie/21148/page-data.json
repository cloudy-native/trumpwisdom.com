I heard good things. There was some very good studies. They went after it...Frontline doctors take it. A lot of people like it since. Then, we got a couple of phony reports and everybody said, oh, no good. Then, since then, some very good reports have come out...Plus, we have a lot of doctors saying it works great. We have one doctor in Westchester, New York. He said he has 500 patients and every one of them lived. You've seen that. But we've had a lot of good report, the French study, and I say it works.”","analysis":"President Trump regularly says he has “great hope” for hydroxychloroquine as a cure for covid-19 or even as a defensive measure, pointing to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920300996\">a preprint study</a> from French doctor Didier Raoult as evidence. The study suggested Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin cured covid-19 patients. At Trump’s urging, the Food and Drug Administration <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/136534/download\">granted emergency</a> approval to distribute millions of doses of the drugs to hospitals across the country on March 30. But experts are wary of putting too much weight on anecdotal reports of the drug's success. The decades-old medication is used to fight malaria, as well as to ease discomfort for patients with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, has not been approved to combat covid-19 and can cause serious side effects. Raoult's study, which had not yet been peer reviewed when it was published, was pulled by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.isac.world/news-and-publications/official-isac-statement\">the science journal</a> that originally printed it for failing to meet scientific standards. Other studies eventually found a higher risk of death and severe heart problems in covid-19 patients who were given hydroxychloroquine. On June 15, FDA withdrew its emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine, concluding that it “is no longer reasonable to believe” that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are effective in treating the disease. “Nor is it reasonable to believe,” the agency said, \"that the known and potential benefits of these products outweigh their known and potential risks.” The World Health Organization on July 4 announced it had ended its own trials after results that \"show that hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir produce little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to standard of care.\"","pinocchios":"4","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"24709, 21966, 22227, 21285, 22682, 21714, 21148, 20640, 20644, 19894, 19753, 19749, 19736, 19415, 19416, 19417, 19421, 19422, 18840, 19677, 18749, 18663, 19451, 19204, 19431, 19054, 19056, 19115, 19037, 19047, 18670, 19000, 19001, 19027, 18137, 17902, 17893, 17948, 17711, 17831, 17973, 17688, 17694","repeated_count":"43","date":"07/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
