You don't have fires like you do in California, you know. In Europe, they have forest cities. You look at -- you look at countries -- Austria. You look at so many countries, they live in the forest. They're considered forest cities -- so many of them. And they don't have fires like this and they have more explosive trees. They have trees that will catch easier. But they maintain their fire. They have an expression, they thin the fuel. The fuel is what's on the ground -- the leaves. The trees that fall, they're dry. They're like -- they're like a matchstick, you know, after 18 months. If they're on the ground longer than 18 months, they're very explosive.
