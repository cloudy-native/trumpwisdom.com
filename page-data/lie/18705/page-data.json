The key indicator is tests per capita, which gives a read on the share of the population that has contracted the disease. A crowdsourced tally <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily\">provided by the Covid Tracking Project</a> says the United States has tested 1.1 million people as of March 31. That represents about 1 in 297 people. Italy, for example, has a smaller population and a lower number of total tests, but it tested about three times as many people on a per capita basis: 1 in 133. As of July 1, the U.S. per capita testing rate was still lower than other major countries, such as the United Kingdom. China in June also claimed it had conducted 90 million tests, triple the number in the United States at the time. Another problem is test results are slow in the United States. \"Test results for the novel coronavirus are taking so long to come back that experts say the results across the United States are often proving useless in the campaign to control the deadly disease,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/long-delays-in-getting-test-results-hobble-coronavirus-response/2020/07/12/d32f7fa8-c1fe-11ea-b4f6-cb39cd8940fb_story.html\">The Washington Post reported in July</a>. \"The long testing turnaround times are making it impossible for the United States to replicate the central strategy used by other countries to effectively contain the virus — test, trace and isolate.\" By Election Day, the United States still was not in the top ten countries when measured by testing per capita.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28955, 29134, 27918, 27023, 26764, 25986, 23963, 23758, 23562, 22083, 23003, 22952, 22968, 21900, 22248, 22881, 21844, 22790, 21258, 21291, 22739, 21717, 22643, 21692, 20907, 20923, 21484, 21109, 21146, 21156, 20875, 20844, 20722, 20379, 20078, 19889, 20347, 18682, 19376, 18873, 19098, 19402, 19419, 19325, 18800, 19562, 19585, 18746, 18939, 19272, 18705, 18715, 18693, 18696, 19541, 19233, 19479, 19470, 19213, 19460, 19201, 18618, 19129, 19143, 19175, 19437, 19094, 19122, 18587, 18085, 17732, 18557, 18583, 18541, 18542, 18543, 18527, 17922, 17933, 17872, 16800","repeated_count":"81","date":"04/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
