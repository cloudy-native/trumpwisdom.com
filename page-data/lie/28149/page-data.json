Mexico is not paying for Trump's border barrier. U.S. taxpayers are paying, via money Trump diverted from authorized military construction projects. This was perhaps Trump's most famous campaign promise -- during the 2016 campaign, Trump more than 200 times said Mexico would pay for the wall -- so he simply pretends that Mexico, in some way, is paying for the project or will in the future, in some ill-defined way, such as through a toll. But he has proposed no actual policy to implement this idea -- and neither has Mexico accepted it. At one point, Trump even said the reworking of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will earn enough money for pay for the wall. This betrays a misunderstanding of economics. Countries do not “lose” money on trade deficits, so there is no money to earn; the size of a trade deficit or surplus can be determined by other factors besides trade.
