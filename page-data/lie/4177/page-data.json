But other studies show there is at least a casual relationship between aid and votes. The final breakdown of countries that receive aid in fiscal 2018 is still pending, so it’s not clear if the Trump administration has “stopped it,” but aid programs were cut by 4.2 percent for fiscal 2018 over 2017.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
