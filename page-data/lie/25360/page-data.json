If we had forest management, you wouldn't have any forest fires. In Europe, you go there, they live, they have forest nations. They call them Austria, different places. They don't have the woods burning down, and heir trees are more explosive than ours. Meaning explosive from potential fire. They have trees and they have, they maintain their forest, and they put cuts in between so if they have a fire it doesn't burn down a half a million acres. They do it properly. Our people don't do that.”","analysis":"Half of the forested land in California is managed by the federal government, and those officials out of necessity have diverted forest management funds to deal with the rash of wildfires. In any event, experts say the most recent wildfires besetting California were not sparked by forest management problems such as an overpopulation of trees or a lack of raking. “The ones in Southern California are burning in chaparral, so it’s not a forest management issue at all,” LeRoy Westerling, a climate and fire researcher at the University of California at Merced, told us. “The fire in Northern California didn’t start in forest; it started in other types of vegetation, from what I read. … There, you're talking about what kind of vegetation people manage on their homes on private properties.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"26991, 27314, 25360, 25166, 26006, 24729, 24183, 24261, 24124, 24138, 24144, 24146, 24035, 23987, 20985, 17451, 14783, 14154, 14263, 12161, 11078, 10474, 8033, 7302, 7233, 7484, 6114, 4266, 4267","repeated_count":"29","date":"10/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
