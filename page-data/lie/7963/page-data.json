But Trump's claim is misleading because the automakers in question already had U.S. operations and never left, and because they are increasing production capacity in the United States but not closing any existing plants in other countries. For example, GM is expanding in Michigan and moving production of one model from Mexico to the new U.S. facility. But the automaker says it's keeping the Mexican plant. Toyota and Mazda are building a new plant in Alabama. But both automakers already had manufacturing facilities in the United States and never left.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
