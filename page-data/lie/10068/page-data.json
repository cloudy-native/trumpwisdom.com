That is not Obstruction.’ @JesseBWatters  I had the right to end the whole Witch Hunt if I wanted. I could have fired everyone, including Mueller, if I wanted. I chose not to. I had the RIGHT to use Executive Privilege. I didn’t!”","analysis":"There is no evidence that Trump was being framed. Trump could not have fired Mueller directly, because such decisions are left by law to the attorney general. Trump may not have asserted executive privilege, but he declined to sit for an interview with Mueller's team, said more than 30 times in his written responses that he could not recall certain information, and stonewalled Mueller's requests for information about the Trump Tower Moscow project. The special counsel's office called Trump's written responses \"inadequate.\" It's a false construct to say \"fighting back\" is not the same as obstructing justice. Mueller laid out substantial evidence of obstruction on Trump's part, but said he declined to reach a decision on bringing charges in part because of a Justice Department policy not to indict a sitting president and in part because he didn't want to get in the way of potential impeachment proceedings in Congress, among other reasons.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
