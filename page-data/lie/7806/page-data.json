But the number of suspected cases of fraudulent parentage is a fraction of the overall number of family units apprehended. The Post’s Joshua Partlow and Nick Miroff reported, between April 19, when the trend was first suspected, and Sept. 30, the end of the 2018 fiscal year, CBP agents separated 170 families after determining that the child and adult traveling together were not related. That equals about 0.25 percent of all family units apprehended.\r\n\r\nDHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman said the December total for apprehensions of unaccompanied children and those with family members was 19,313. But it’s wrong to describe it as a statistic that represents children being smuggled into the country. Border officials screen for false claims of parentage. To imply as Trump has that a child’s mother, father or legal guardian is or hired a smuggler, coyote or gang member in all of these cases is wrong.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8275, 8113, 7806, 7766, 8214, 7875","repeated_count":"6","date":"01/14/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
