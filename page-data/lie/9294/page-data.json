Ours is not actually complex. We have very, very bad laws that are archaic, that were put in by Democrats. And the Republicans didn't fight hard enough at the time. That was a long time before me. But we have catch and release, and we have chain migration, and we have all sorts of things that are horrible.”","analysis":"Catch and release is a collection of policies, court precedents, executive actions and federal statutes spanning more than 20 years, cobbled together throughout Democratic and Republican administrations, including his own. It primarily applies to asylum seekers and children. Trump's mother- and father-in-law immigrated to the United States through chain migration.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"14877, 14675, 13691, 11659, 11379, 11422, 12227, 11512, 11128, 10793, 10956, 10638, 10642, 10573, 10378, 10298, 9840, 9648, 9482, 9598, 9604, 9447, 9323, 9294, 8682, 8748, 8182, 7913, 7738, 7168, 6701, 6959, 7117, 7147, 6823, 7041, 7073, 6656, 6233, 6012, 5209, 6335, 6339, 6134, 6409, 6421, 6453, 5460, 5957, 5451, 5900, 4779, 4834, 5002, 4643, 4427, 4462, 4441, 3889, 3736, 3686, 3431, 3556, 3558, 3459, 3550, 3552, 3485, 3526, 3376, 3384, 3425, 3381, 3404, 3203, 3131, 3125, 2980, 2686, 2814","repeated_count":"80","date":"03/14/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
