The Obama administration had been able to win broad international support for crippling sanctions precisely because it convinced Russia and China, two major Iranian partners, that the pressure was designed to curb Iran’s nuclear ambitions and force the government into negotiations. If the government had started to teeter because of the sanctions, especially if it was perceived as part of an American campaign of regime change, that support probably would have been withdrawn.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/13/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
