You'd thought he lost. You remember that? He, sort of, gave -- he stopped campaigning. It was over. And then he won by three points. And we have him in the Senate. And now he's this great honorable guy, because you know why? The fake news doesn't ever want to put that stuff on. They don't want to talk about it. They don't ever want to put it on. They're a bunch of fakers.”","analysis":"Blumenthal on a few occasions before his first Senate race in 2010 said or implied he had served in Vietnam, when he hadn't. But Trump seems to have fabricated a bunch of anecdotes and statements that Blumenthal never uttered. He did not stop campaigning in 2010 and won by 12 points, not three. Trump complains that the media did not cover this story, which was broken by the New York Times.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"25635, 25788, 25790, 7551, 6877, 6955, 5428, 5342, 5318, 5319, 5799, 5800, 5801, 5187, 5199, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5790","repeated_count":"19","date":"10/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
