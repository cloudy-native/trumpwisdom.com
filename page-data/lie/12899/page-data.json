Not a thing wrong.... I heard Rick Scott today say, 'That was a perfect conversation. How can they impeach him on that conversation?' He read it. He's a very smart guy from Florida -- Rick Scott -- and he said, 'That was a perfect conversation. How can you impeach somebody on that conversation?' But the whistleblower wrote not that conversation.”","analysis":"Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) never said Trump’s phone call was a “perfect conversation.” Instead, in a variety of interview, he professed confusion about whether the president did something wrong. “I still don't see what the crime is,” Scott said on Fox News. “I keep saying, show me what the crime is. No one ever says that. They say he shouldn't have done it. Well, all of us would do things differently than other people would do it but if we're going to impeach somebody there ought to be something they did wrong.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
