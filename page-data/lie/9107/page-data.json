They charge us a lot when we send a motorcycle to India. It's 100 percent tariff. They charge 100 percent.

India in 2017 announced it would reduce the duties from 100 percent to 50 percent, but Harley already got around that higher duty by assembling in India most of the 4,500 motorcycles sold in the country. Harley, for its part, says it is indifferent to the matter and has no objection to India’s import duties. Former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) also says the Wisconsin-based company opposes higher tariffs for steel and aluminum because of the potential negative impact on its sales.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"18135, 12429, 11722, 10247, 9682, 9107, 8376, 5250, 5266, 4086, 3821, 2465, 2451, 2380, 0897, 0921, 0540, 0276, 0196, 0197","repeated_count":"20","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
