Where the unemployment numbers are the best in 51 years.”","analysis":"The black and Hispanic unemployment rates have been calculated only since 1972, so it's an exaggeration to say the current numbers are the lowest ever. The U.S. jobless rate for Asians has been around for less than 20 years. Although the black unemployment rate was at an all-time-low 5.9 percent in May, it had risen to 6 percent in November. That was still significantly higher than the overall unemployment rate of 3.7 percent. And while it reached a low of 2.1 percent rate in May 2018, the Asian-American unemployment had risen to 3.2 percent in January, the most recent month available.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"14891, 14437, 15287, 14084, 14591, 14657, 13522, 13505, 13194, 13206, 12826, 12838, 13637, 13664, 13095, 12730, 12299, 12484, 11375, 11705, 12221, 11227, 11172, 11053, 10982, 10711, 10522, 10186, 10217, 10091, 10039, 9413, 9487, 9062, 8721, 8467, 8534, 7607, 7332, 7187, 6723, 6874, 6951, 6672, 6848, 6509, 6741, 6539, 6592, 6272, 6246, 6398, 6498, 5929, 5908, 5417, 5602, 5294, 5526, 5222, 5257, 5159, 5168, 4786, 4854, 4908, 4702, 4411, 4729, 4322, 4226, 4239","repeated_count":"72","date":"01/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
