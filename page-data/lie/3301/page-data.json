They waited until the last second. And they shouldn't have waited. This should have been solved by many others. I'm not just saying President Obama; I'm saying other Presidents. A long time ago, this could have been solved in a lot easier manner and a lot less dangerous manner. But it wasn't. So I'll solve it, and we'll get it done.”","analysis":"Trump is unusually ungracious to his predecessors, especially considering he has only just embarked on negotiations. Bill Clinton negotiated a nuclear agreement with North Korea that froze its plutonium program and was working on a missile deal when he departed office. But that agreement fell apart under George W. Bush. But then Bush tried to negotiate a deal, even lifting sanctions on North Korea. But that deal fell apart once Obama was elected. In each case, North Korea used the arrival of a new president to wiggle out of its commitments.
