But he ignores that the report faulted the Trump campaign for accepting meetings with Russian operatives in hopes of getting \"dirt\" on Hillary Clinton. And while Trump again highlights the \"dossier,\" the report confirmed that the FBI counterintelligence investigation began not with the dossier but with a tip about a Trump campaign operative who appears to have heard about the hacking of Democratic emails from a Russian operative. The special counsel was appointed because Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"3862, 4137, 3061, 2950, 2957, 2930, 2770, 2603, 2576, 2719, 2623","repeated_count":"11","date":"04/27/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
