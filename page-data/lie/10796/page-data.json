If you look at — if you look at Bill Clinton, that very nice gentleman who’s been so much on my side, as you know, his special prosecutor — it was guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty. So many guiltys.  With me, there was no guilty.”","analysis":"Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, but he was acquitted by the Senate — meaning he was ultimately not found “guilty.” The case against Clinton was brought under the Independent Counsel statute, which has since expired. Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, did not issue a criminal indictment of Clinton; in the report to Congress on his investigation, Starr said there was “substantial and credible information supporting … eleven possible grounds for impeachment” by Congress, including several examples of perjury and obstruction of justice.\" Special Counsel Robert Mueller operated under an internal DOJ regulation, and so reported to the Attorney General, not to Congress.
