Yesterday, the Supreme Court took up the Census Citizenship question, a really big deal. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”","analysis":"In this tweet, Trump undercuts the administration's official reason for requesting a citizenship question on the Census. Administration officials have argued the citizenship question would improve the quality of the data the Justice Department uses to enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. This section “prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in one of the language minority groups” recognized by law. More than a dozen states and cities and a range of groups sued to block the administration's move, calling the citizenship question a ruse by the Trump administration to weaken the political power of heavily Democratic states with large immigrant populations. Census data is used to allocate federal funds, draw legislative districts and reapportion congressional seats. Three federal judges who have ruled on these claims all found that adding the citizenship question would probably produce an undercount.
