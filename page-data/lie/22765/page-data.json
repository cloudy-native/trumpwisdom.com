They're thousands of votes off. They're missing votes. There are fraudulent votes. They have to do the election over. There's no way that she can take that election because -- I mean, it's between two Democrats, but I guess he's probably, as the expression goes, more progressive. But she's -- she's in trouble.”","analysis":"Results were delayed for several weeks in a New York congressional primary, with Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) eventually declared the winner.

More than 1 in 5 ballots were discarded, many multiples of the final margin,” Suraj Patel, Maloney’s opponent, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/surajpatelnyc/status/1311135111644155909\">wrote on Twitter</a>. “We called our election a canary in the coal mine for November, we were right.
