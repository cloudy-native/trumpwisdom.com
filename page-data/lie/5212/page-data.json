First, the map showed air quality data worldwide for 2016, one year before Trump took office. Second, the claim added to the map — that \"none in [the] U.S.\" are exposed to pollutants levels above WHO's recommendations — is inaccurate. Finally, the United States does not have the world's best air quality, as Trump claimed. According to WHO's database of the annual average concentrations of fine particulate matter in urban areas, Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and New Zealand each were less polluted than the United States in 2016.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30614, 27011, 26807, 26463, 26206, 23713, 21823, 22688, 21186, 22570, 20281, 17995, 17622, 17207, 16760, 16108, 16188, 16448, 15489, 14046, 13737, 12756, 12934, 13263, 12326, 11338, 11945, 11196, 10308, 10311, 11000, 9945, 7405, 7443, 7028, 6044, 5212, 5965, 5695","repeated_count":"39","date":"10/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
