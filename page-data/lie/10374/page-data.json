They would have red walls and you would never see Christmas. That was four years ago. Take a look at your stores nowadays. It's all Merry Christmas again. Merry Christmas again. They are proud of it. I always said you are going to be saying Merry Christmas again and that is what has happened.”","analysis":"This claim is a strange favorite of the president's. There is no evidence that stores stopped using Merry Christmas in their advertising, were \"ashamed\" to do so or that any of this changed since Trump took office.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
