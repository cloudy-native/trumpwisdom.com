That was something that nobody -- that was something that nobody heard of before: after the moment of birth. Nobody believed it. I had never heard of it. I don't think anybody had heard of it. When he talked about wrapping the child and then discussing with the mother whether or not she wants to keep -- the child is born. So that becomes an execution. That becomes an execution.”","analysis":"Trump mischaracterizes remarks by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D), even sometimes claiming that Northam himself killed a baby. Northam told a radio show that late-term abortion procedures are “done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that’s not viable. So in this particular example, if a mother’s in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” Critics suggested the governor was endorsing infanticide. His office later said the governor was referring to medical treatment, not ending the life of a baby.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"28530, 25157, 25093, 24664, 24578, 22530, 20102, 17825, 18190, 15447, 15528, 14681, 13939, 12697, 12440, 11633, 11491, 11811, 10888, 10267, 9720, 9556, 9146, 8736","repeated_count":"24","date":"06/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
