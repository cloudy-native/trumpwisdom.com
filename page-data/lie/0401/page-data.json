VERY weak on crime and illegal immigration, bad for jobs and wants higher taxes. Say NO”","analysis":"Jon Ossoff, the Democrat Trump is referring to, supports a comprehensive immigration bill that allows a \"path to legal status\" for undocumented people (excluding felons) living in the country. But he also said he supports strong border security. As PolitiFact found, this is not the same as \"allowing illegal immigration.\" On taxes, factcheck.org found that Ossoff has proposed to simplify the tax code, and that “in order to lower tax rates, we can eliminate carve-outs and special treatment in the tax code that privilege large organizations at the expense of small businesses.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"0454, 0396","repeated_count":"2","date":"04/18/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
