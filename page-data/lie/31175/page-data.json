You say you’re released into our country. I ended it. You’re released. Come back in four years. We're going to take you to court. So far, nobody’s ever shown up. I mean, literally, they almost don’t show up and turn out. That’s when I had the big debate with Biden. They come back for court. I said, no, they don’t.”","analysis":"This is a regular complaint of the president’s, but it was not accurate when he debated Biden and is not accurate now.\n\nThe chain of events that Trump describes — and calls “catch and release” — applies when someone first appeals for asylum. The United States follows the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, which says that a refugee enters and makes a petition, and the government makes a ruling after analyzing the facts.\n\nThe vast majority — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/06/26/president-trumps-misconceptions-about-immigration-courts-and-law/\">almost 85 percent of all deportations</a> — in the United States are ordered quickly, without a hearing before a judge. Still, Justice Department data <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/05/10/fact-checking-trump-administrations-immigration-fact-sheet/\">shows</a> the vast majority of non-detained migrants given a court date have returned and attended their immigration court proceedings. For asylum seekers, data suggests the return rate is even higher.\n\nIn other words, Trump was wrong and Biden was right.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/04/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
