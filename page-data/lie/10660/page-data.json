On a media tour following the release of his memoir, McCabe said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the Russia investigation, raised the idea of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office due to concern about the president’s “capacity and his intent” in the hectic days following James B.
