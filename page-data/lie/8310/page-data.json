Roughly the same outcomes were expected if Obama administration policies had remained in place. Trump administration officials have claimed that some incremental/technical changes to the marketplaces have made a difference but Republicans have also undermined the Obamacare markets with  counteracting actions such as repealing the individual mandate and expanding alternatives that are drawing people out of the marketplaces.
