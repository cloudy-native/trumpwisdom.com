We're the only people, people walk-in, they put a foot in. ‘Please, would you like to register?’ Other countries, they say, ‘Get the hell out of here.’ They do that, they have to do that. We say, you know, they want to hire now 5,000 more judges, so that a person puts the toe in the land that we have to go to trial.”","analysis":"This is a gross distortion of how immigration and asylum laws work. U.S. policy is to detain adults who are apprehended crossing the border illegally. Anyone who enters without authorization must apply for asylum or legal residence, and there's a vetting process to adjudicate their claims. The U.S. has around 350 immigration judges. There's no evidence that anyone is asking for 5,000 more. Trump says U.S. immigration laws are weak, but they are comparatively tough and it's the same system used by many countries.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"4289, 3893, 4182, 3438, 3430, 3435, 3569, 3999, 3978, 3488, 3950","repeated_count":"11","date":"06/23/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
