(The stat also relies on numbers that the Census Bureau <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2020/09/was-household-income-the-highest-ever-in-2019.html\">says</a> are sketchy because a pandemic-induced survey bias.) It took <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/10/03/black-household-income-is-rising-across-the-united-states/\">almost eight years</a> for Black median incomes to recover from the recession, meaning any gain would be small indeed. Incomes finally started to rise late in Obama's term, and Trump inherited the continued increase. So from a low base, Trump is able to tout a nine-times gain. But the statistic mostly demonstrates the idiocy of measuring economic trends by presidential terms. (Of course, once Trump completes his term, his economic record is going to take a beating from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"27013, 26829, 26384, 26456, 26111, 26137, 25684","repeated_count":"7","date":"10/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
