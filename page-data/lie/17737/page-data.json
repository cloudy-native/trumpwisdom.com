I guess they didn't take that option. That was in 2016 and that’s a hard option to take because it’s a lot of money and who would ever think you need 16,000 ventilators? Who would ever think it?”","analysis":"Trump keeps repeating this specious claim to deflect questions about the ventilator shortage in New York. It comes from the right-leaning website Gateway Pundit, which in turn borrowed from an opinion piece in the New York Post by Betsy McCaughey, a New York Republican politician who was once married to Trump’s commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross. It’s a false construct, especially as Trump framed it. McCaughey claims New York, which has 2,000 ventilators, could have purchased 16,000 in 2015. That’s when a task force set out guidelines for allocating ventilators during a possible pandemic. However, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.health.ny.gov/regulations/task_force/reports_publications/docs/ventilator_guidelines.pdf\">the task force report</a> made no recommendation for buying ventilators, let alone a number such as 16,000. “New York State may have enough ventilators to meet the needs of patients in a moderately severe pandemic,” the report said. “In a severe public health emergency on the scale of the 1918 influenza pandemic, however, these ventilators would not be sufficient to meet the demand.” The report noted that buying too many ventilators might be counterproductive: “Severe staffing shortages are anticipated, and purchasing additional ventilators beyond a threshold will not save additional lives, because there will not be a sufficient number of trained staff to operate them.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"19501, 19018, 18142, 18157, 17737, 18568, 18512, 18519","repeated_count":"8","date":"03/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
