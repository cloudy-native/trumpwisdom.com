You do know that. We have 40,000 troops in South Korea, it's very expensive.”","analysis":"There are about 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea. A 2013 Senate report found that the U.S. spent $10 billion a year on bases abroad, with 70 percent focused on three countries - Germany, South Korea and Japan. South Korea recently paid about 90 percent of the cost of building the news military base outside Seoul. Korean officials say they underwrite about 70 percent of the cost of existing bases, when the cost of rent-free land is included. The United States is able to project its power overseas because of bases located within allies, so just counting dollars provides just part of the picture. The troops in Korea deter an attack by North Korea. Given a defense budget of about $700 billion, the cost of maintaining these bases is a mere pittance.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"16656, 15802, 12490, 12604, 11319, 10556, 10869, 10249, 8787, 8717, 8475, 6020, 5371, 5772","repeated_count":"14","date":"02/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
