And they're still there.”","analysis":"Trump often blames Obama when he is in political hot water. The Obama administration did walk a fine line in order to maintain both alliances, but the current situation is clearly the result of Trump's quick withdrawal. Plus, the Turks and Kurds have lived side by side for thousands of years. The conflict between Turkish citizens and the stateless Kurds is more recent and nuanced. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/world/middleeast/kurds-turkey-syria.html\">The New York Times reported</a>, “Turkey has been in conflict with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, known as the P.K.K., since it launched a violent separatist movement in the country in the early 1980s. Both Turkey and the United States consider the P.K.K. a terrorist organization.” Plus, the argument that there is a long-standing internal conflict has often been used by U.S. government officials when they are avoiding intervening in a potentially disastrous human rights crisis.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
