AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka has warned House Democrats not to expedite approval of the new North American trade deal, saying that the agreement remains far from complete and that a vote in coming weeks would be a “colossal mistake.” He <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2019/10/09/trumka-says-fast-action-trade-pact-with-canada-mexico-would-be-colossal-mistake/\">told The Washington Post</a> in October, 2019: “If there was a vote before Thanksgiving, the agreement would be defeated.” (Note: As of December 9, 2019, major unions <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aflcio.org/pressreleases/afl-cio-endorses-usmca-after-successfully-negotiating-improvements\">such as the AFL-CIO</a> switched their support in favor of USMCA after changes were made to win the votes of House Democrats.)
