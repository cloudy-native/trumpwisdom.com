But China did not inform the World Health Organization of Wuhan’s several cases of pneumonia, of unknown origin, until December 31, 2019, even though it likely had knowledge of these cases days or weeks earlier.”","analysis":"“Human influenza caused by a new subtype” is always supposed to be reported to the WHO within 24 hours. Trump has a point here, but he does not acknowledge that action from the WHO forced China’s hand. “WHO headquarters in Geneva first learned about the outbreak in Wuhan not directly from Chinese authorities, but rather from the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), a U.S.-based open-source platform for early intelligence about infectious disease outbreaks,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46354#page=12\">according to a comprehensive timeline issued by the Congressional Research Service</a>. Headquarters then “asked the WHO China Country Office to request ‘verification of the event’ from the government of China.” WHO acted under regulations that it “take into account reports from sources other than notifications or consultations” by countries. CRS noted “it appears China may not have proactively notified WHO of the outbreak.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
