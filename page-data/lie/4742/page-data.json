Celebrate Labor Day!”","analysis":"The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that wages have fallen 0.2 percent in the past 12 months after adjusting for inflation. Consumer prices increased 2.9 percent this summer from a year earlier, the most in six years, so wage gains are being lost to inflation. In fact, corrected for inflation, wages are up a scant 2 percent since January 2015, according to BLS. The gain is roughly one-half of 1 percent annually. One study found that for the bottom 60 percent of workers, even these meager wage gains have been wiped out by increased contributions for employer-provided health insurance.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/03/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
