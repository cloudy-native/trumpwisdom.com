They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!”","analysis":"This is misleading. Democrats have never proposed allowing convicted violent felons to walk. This tweet was a reference to border security negotiations. Democrats wanted to cap the number of detention beds for ICE as a way to impose an informal quota on detentions of undocumented immigrants. But ICE is not the agency in charge of policing violent crime. They mostly enforce civil immigration violations and handle deportations. Anyone charged with or convicted of violent crime is detained by law enforcement agencies apart from ICE, such as state or local police or the FBI, and held in custody regardless of how many beds ICE has at its disposal.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8675, 8696, 8700, 8737, 8660, 8665","repeated_count":"6","date":"02/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
