Have to be very, very careful, and this time they're trying to do it with the whole Post Office scam.”","analysis":"Trump has concocted a series of strange conspiracy theories about Obama spying on his campaign, which he sometimes labels \"Obamagate.\" It started with Trump's false claim in 2017 that Obama put a wiretap on him. Then that merged with a report that an FBI informant in Europe, a professor named Stefan Halper, met with at least three people working on the Trump campaign in Europe. A former campaign aide, Carter Page, was subject to an FBI warrant. Eventually Trump's obsession became focused on a January 2017 meeting that Obama held in the Oval Office with then FBI director James Comey, Vice President Joe Biden and national security adviser Susan Rice, among others. Rice indicated in an email that Obama was primarily concerned with whether limits should be placed on classified information that was shared with the incoming team, in particular incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn, in light of the intercepts of the calls between Flynn and the Russian ambassador. Although presidents generally are expected not to inquire about criminal investigations, it is appropriate to have a discussion about a counterintelligence probe, as that involves national security. Somehow, without much explanation, Trump has turned this meeting into a high crime that he considers to be treason.
