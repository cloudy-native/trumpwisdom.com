His website states, “As a gun owner, Jon has voted against legislation that would violate Montanans’ Second Amendment rights and hinder the ability of law-abiding citizens to purchase and own a gun.” Tester voted to confirm Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who dissented from the court’s 2010 decision McDonald v. Chicago, which expanded gun-possession rights. But she also dissented in Voisine v. United States, which restricted gun rights for people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors.","pinocchios":"","category":"Guns","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
