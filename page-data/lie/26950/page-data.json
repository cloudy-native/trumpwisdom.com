Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it.”","analysis":"Reducing racial disparities in the criminal justice system has been {a bipartisan project for both the Obama and Trump administrations}. A 1986 law sponsored by Biden when he was a senator required a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for trafficking in 500 grams of powder cocaine or 5 grams of crack, a ratio of 100 to 1.\n\nObama signed the bipartisan Fair Sentencing Act in August 2010, repealing the five-year mandatory sentence for first-time offenders and reducing the sentencing disparity to 18 to 1 for repeat offenders. In other words, an offense involving 500 grams of powder cocaine still required a minimum sentence of five years. But the threshold for a five-year sentence was raised for crack cocaine offenses, from 5 grams to 28 grams.\n\nThe Fair Sentencing Act applied prospectively, meaning the crack cocaine disparity was reduced only for offenses that occurred after Obama signed the law in 2010. Trump and his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, pushed for a new round of changes in the criminal justice system, bringing together a bipartisan coalition of Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, the American Civil Liberties Union and others, prevailing on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to post the bill for a vote, and weathering criticism from conservatives such as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). The result was the First Step Act, which Trump signed in 2018.\n\nThe First Step Act builds on what Obama did by making the 2010 reform to crack sentencing laws retroactive. But it goes well beyond that, for instance, by shortening mandatory minimum sentences across the board for nonviolent drug offenses at the federal level.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"29832, 29918, 30294, 30527, 29303, 29635, 29532, 29701, 29952, 30006, 30131, 29153, 26950, 26732, 27275, 27547, 26323, 25412, 25319, 25370, 24960, 23676, 23119, 21913, 22373, 22465, 21744, 22138, 20910, 20499, 20433, 20076, 20112, 19982, 20134, 20192, 20196, 19875, 19851, 20316, 18875, 17633, 17549, 17047, 16949, 17025, 17216, 17163, 16888, 18196, 15839, 15749, 15190, 13318, 12474, 12346","repeated_count":"56","date":"10/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
