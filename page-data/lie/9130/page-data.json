By extension, any greenhouse-gas-emitting energy source would fall out of use. But nuclear energy is a zero-emission energy source. Some consider natural gas to be a \"clean\" energy source, since it emits half as much carbon dioxide as burning coal. Trump is wrong to claim that the United States became the largest oil and natural gas producer because of moves he made. The U.S. has been the top natural gas producer since 2009. The Energy Information Administration says the U.S. became the top oil producer recently, under Trump's watch, but not because of his moves.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
