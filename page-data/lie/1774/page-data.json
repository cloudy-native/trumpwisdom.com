The individual mandate penalty provides little funding for the Affordable Care Act -- only about $3 billion out of an annual cost of $120 billion. Moreover, while the individual mandate was an important incentive for Americans to seek health insurance, it was only one part of a far-reaching law that remains intact. The repeal does not take effect until 2019.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/20/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
