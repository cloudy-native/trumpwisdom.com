Third Circuit, Court of Appeals. 'Lou, that's why this next Election is so important, the soul of America. They want to take religion out of American lives. Thank God for judges like this (Judge Thomas Ambro, Majority Opinion), and thank God for a President like Donald J. Trump, who will appoint judges like this. He will soon have appointed 180 new Federal Judges, not even including two great new Supreme Court Justices.' @robertjeffress @LouDobbs”","analysis":"Trump effectively cut and pasted a quote from Jeffress, who heads the First Baptist Church in Dallas, even adding in a reference to Supreme Court justices that Jeffress did not make. The actual quote was: \"President Trump is appointing, I think over 180, so far, appellate judges who are going to interpret the law by what the Constitution really says not by what liberals wish it said. And they have perverted the establishment clause to try to remove religious expression from every area of American lives. And thank God, and I mean this literally, thank God for judges like this, thank God for a president like Donald Trump who will appoint judges like this.\" ","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
