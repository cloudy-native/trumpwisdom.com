Other countries come to see me, all of their leaders, and they say, sir, first thing. Sir, congratulations on your economy. ...

And if they do, they say Obama did it.”","analysis":"Trump first made this grandiose claim when the U.S. economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the third quarter of 2018. Many other countries had faster growth rates at the time, including China and India, but the president has persisted with this false assessment. News reports about the U.S. economic expansion are published on a daily basis. Trump succeeded Obama during a sustained period of economic growth, which he rarely acknowledges.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
