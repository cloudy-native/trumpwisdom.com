Think of that: 25 million. If you look at other countries, they did 1 million, 2 million, 3 million. Big countries. We did 25 million. Way more by double, triple, quadruple any other country. Therefore, with tests, we're going to have more cases. By having more cases, it sounds bad, but actually what it is, is we're finding people. Many of those people aren't sick or very little. You know, they may be young people.”","analysis":"Trump is wrong. Russia, India and the United Kingdom all had done more than 10 million tests at this point, so the United States was not ahead by 20 million tests. In any case, China announced in June that it had conducted 90 million tests, three times more than the United States. What ultimately matters is testng per million people, and as of early July the United States still lagged major countries such as the U.K., Russia and Spain under this metric. The number of coronavirus cases is rising because the disease has been spreading for months, abetted in part by a lax and inconsistent response from U.S. political leaders. As of mid-2020, the total number of new weekly cases had been rising, and the rate of positive test results also was increasing.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
