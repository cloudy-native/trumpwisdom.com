They are smart walls designed to meet the needs of frontline border agents, and are operationally effective. These barriers are made of steel, have see-through visibility, which is very important, and are equipped with sensors, monitors, and cutting-edge technology, including state-of-the-art drones. We do not need 2,000 miles of concrete wall from sea to shining sea -- we never did; we never proposed that; we never wanted that -- because we have barriers at the border where natural structures are as good as anything that we can build. They're already there. They've been there for millions of years. Our proposed structures will be in pre-determined high-risk locations that have been specifically identified by the Border Patrol to stop illicit flows of people and drugs.”","analysis":"Trump is moving the goalposts from the all-concrete wall, for which he commissioned prototypes, to a see-through fence made of steel. In the end, placing fences in \"predetermined, high-risk locations\" along the border is the same as has been done for decades.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
