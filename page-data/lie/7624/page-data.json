Want them!”","analysis":"The special counsel investigation into potential collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign and obstruction of justice continues, and no conclusions have been announced. All aspects of the investigation have widely been covered by the media and there's no evidence to suggest that it is a \"witch hunt.\" The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2018/i-2018-003523.pdf\">Justice Department inspector general's report</a> suggests the texts slipped through the cracks but were not deliberately deleted. While the messages were initially not captured, they have since been recovered. There is no evidence Strzok and Page tried to prevent the FBI from collecting their texts, the report said.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"16925, 15025, 11360, 7742, 7193, 7624, 7280","repeated_count":"7","date":"12/16/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
