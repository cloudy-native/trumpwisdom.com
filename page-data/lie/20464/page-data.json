Russia ate his and Obama’s lunch during their time in office, so badly that Obama wanted them out of the then G-8. U.S. was weak on everything, but especially Russia!”","analysis":"This is an absurd way to recall recent history. Russia invaded Crimea, a part of Ukraine, sparking outrage in the West, and the other seven G-8 member nations acted in concert to expel Russia from the group in 2014. Trump repeatedly claims that \"Putin took Crimea from Obama,\" and this remark about Obama throwing a tantrum and getting the other members of the G-8 to drop Russia is a version of the same tortured logic.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/28/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
