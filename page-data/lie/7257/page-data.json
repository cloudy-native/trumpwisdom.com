They would immediately provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance.”","analysis":"Trump offers a rather rosy view of Saudi intentions in Yemen and he is mostly repeating Saudi propaganda. Iran’s involvement in Yemen was minimal before the Saudi-led intervention began. The Saudis could have withdrawn at any point in the last three years, but doing so would have meant they admitted the intervention had been a failure. Saudi Arabia has shown little interest in the plight of the Yemeni people so it's doubtful the government would provide humanitarian assistance.
