The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly. That will do much to put out the flame... ....of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony. Fake News Must End!”","analysis":"Trump blames the media for a lot of things, but this is absurd. These tweets allude to two notorious individuals. Cesar Sayoc is an ardent Trump supporter who mailed pipe bombs to CNN and prominent Democratic figures including Barack Obama and Bill and Hillary Clinton. Trump routinely attacks CNN and these same Democrats in his rallies and public remarks. Robert Bowers murdered 11 Jewish congregants at a Pittsburgh synagogue in the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. According to his online postings, Bowers believed Jewish people were secretly behind the migrant caravan from Central America. Trump and top administration officials have also spread baseless conspiracy theories about who might be funding the caravan.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/29/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
