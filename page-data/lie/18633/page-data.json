And you see what happened to Italy. You see what happened to Spain. You see what happened to France. WHO's guidance had failed to control their borders at a very crucial phase, quickly unleashing the contagion around the world. That was a horrible, tragic mistake -- or perhaps they knew. I'm sure they didn't know the gravity of it, but perhaps they knew. Because if they knew the gravity, that would be an even worse offense.”","analysis":"At least 38 countries imposed travel restrictions on China before or at the same time as the United States, according to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/07/trumps-claim-that-he-imposed-first-china-ban/\">Fact Checker</a> calculation. One of them was Italy. On Jan. 30, the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus. That same day, Italy confirmed two cases of coronavirus in the country — two Chinese tourists who had landed in Rome some days earlier. The patients were isolated in a hospital in Rome. Italy’s prime minister took immediate action, declaring a state of emergency and announcing a ban effective Jan. 31 on all flights to and from China to Italy, with no exceptions. He announced this step even though the WHO advisory recommended against travel restrictions. The ban on flights also extended to Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. The announcement added that anyone on a flight to Italy would face health checks upon arrival.
