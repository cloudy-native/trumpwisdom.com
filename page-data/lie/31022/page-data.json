In response to a lawsuit, Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar had issued guidance saying Pennsylvania county boards of elections can no longer reject a ballot based solely on an election official’s belief that a signature does not match the signature in the voter’s file. Both the Pennsylvania Supreme Court , in an unanimous decision, and federal judge appointed by Trump said the guidance was legal.  \"We decline to read a signature comparison requirement into the plain and unambiguous language of the Election Code,\" the Pennsylvania Supreme Court <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://casetext.com/case/in-re-nov-3-2020-general-election-1\">said</a> in its decision.  Similarly, U.S. District Court Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://casetext.com/case/in-re-nov-3-2020-general-election-1\">ruled</a>: \"After carefully considering the parties' arguments and the relevant law, the Court finds that the plain language of the Election Code imposes no requirement for signature comparison for mail-in and absentee ballots and applications. In other words, the Secretary's guidance is consistent with the Election Code, and creates no vote-dilution problems.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
