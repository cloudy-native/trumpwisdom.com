However, a large reason opioid prescribing has dropped is because the Centers for Disease Control issued <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/dpk/prescription-drug-overdose/opioid-prescription-guidelines/dpk-opioid-prescription-guidelines.html\">opioid prescribing guidelines in early 2016</a>, before Trump took office, which resulted both in doctors prescribing fewer opioids as well as insurers providing less coverage for opioids. Opioid prescriptions peaked in 2012 and started down in 2013, as states began restricting prescriptions and instituting computer checks to discourage “doctor shopping.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"28679, 27938, 21853, 18198, 13151, 12535, 12377, 12432","repeated_count":"8","date":"08/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
