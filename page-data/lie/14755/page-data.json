He was treated very badly but, despite this, was completely exonerated on all major charges. I then restored Eddie’s rank. Likewise, large cost overruns from past administration’s contracting procedures were not addressed to my satisfaction. Therefore, Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer’s services have been terminated by Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.”","analysis":"Trump's intervention in military discipline proceedings against Navy SEALs and other soldiers is highly unusual and led to the resignation of the Navy Secretary.  Trump confuses rigorous military discipline with a notion of trained “killing machines” that comes from bad war movies. In reality, American troops are trained as much in when not to shoot their weapons as they are in how to shoot them.  The U.S. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24.pdf\">Army’s counterinsurgency field manual</a> states: “Counterinsurgents often achieve the most meaningful success in garnering public support and legitimacy for the host-nation government with activities that do not involve killing insurgents.” Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, the SEAL platoon leader at the center of a high-profile war crimes case, appealed directly to Trump via social media and Fox News. Some experts fear this will encourage rogue operators to try to escape accountability by sidestepping the chain of command and appealing directly to the White House.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"14793, 14795, 14913, 14807, 14755, 15769, 14235","repeated_count":"7","date":"11/24/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
