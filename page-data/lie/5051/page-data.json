Do you know who the one is? George Washington. Percentage-wise. I'll have more than him, too, but percentage-wise. I said that the other, you know I have 145 [federal judges], plus hopefully two Supreme Court judges. And that's assuming nobody leaves the bench which they will over the next period of time. It'll be number one. I ought to say, 'Who has highest percentage of federal judges.' They say, 'You do.' I'll say, 'No, no. I got killed.' They said 'Who? George Washington because he appointed a hundred per cent of the judges.'”","analysis":"The Associated Press examined this claim and said it was wildly off-base: \"So far Trump has appointed 68 judges who have been confirmed to the federal courts. That translates to about 8 percent of the total federal judgeships at the 20-month mark in his presidency. That lags at least four previous presidents in terms of both raw numbers and percentages, said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and expert on judicial appointments. Wheeler, a former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center, crunched historical data from the center and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. He found that Trump trails Republican presidents George W. Bush (77) and Ronald Reagan (78), as well as Democrats Bill Clinton (85) and John F. Kennedy (109) at comparable points in their presidencies. Wheeler also put together a ranking based on the number of appointees in 20 months as a percentage of 'authorized judgeships,' or the total seats created by Congress. Trump lagged at least 17 other presidents, including Washington, who as the first president appointed 100 per cent of the federal judges.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/18/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
