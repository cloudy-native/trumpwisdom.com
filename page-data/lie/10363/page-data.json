Mueller reported direct costs and also indirect costs, which no other special counsel had reported for previous investigations. He seized assets from Paul Manafort worth more than $40 million as part of the probe. Those assets now belong to taxpayers and there's a case to be made that the special counsel's investigation therefore made more money than it spent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"30830, 30771, 29796, 29879, 30261, 30461, 29205, 28071, 28180, 26236, 25377, 25088, 24539, 23433, 22335, 21341, 22666, 21173, 20692, 20514, 19758, 16686, 16089, 16005, 14917, 14357, 14372, 14416, 14184, 13763, 12958, 13679, 13003, 11776, 11097, 10745, 10787, 10718, 10438, 10449, 10453, 10959, 10961, 10592, 10570, 10533, 10852, 10932, 10363, 10150, 9785, 10116, 9660","repeated_count":"53","date":"05/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
