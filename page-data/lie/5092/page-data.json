As a result, our trade deficit ballooned to nearly $800 billion a year.”","analysis":"The U.S. trade deficit in 2017 was $568 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Trump gets his $800 billion number by looking only at the deficit for trade in goods ($811 billion) even though U.S. trade in services runs a substantial surplus of $243 billion. Moreover, Trump blames the trade deficit on the actions of other countries. But trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors such as the relative strength of currencies, economic growth rates, and savings and investment rates.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/25/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
