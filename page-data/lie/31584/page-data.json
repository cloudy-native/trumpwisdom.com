It wasn't about Republican or Democrat, but about the good of a nation.”","analysis":"This is a line that actually never appeared in Trump’s campaign speeches. Instead, he constantly attacked Democrats as a force of evil. \n\n“Remember this it's all Democrat run cities, radical left Democrats, Democrats,” he said at Oct 31 rally. “You look at what's going on all Democrat run cities. Republicans have no problems, our cities are doing great.” At a Jan. 4 rally, Trump declared that Democrats will “turn our entire country into one giant sanctuary for criminal aliens, setting loose tens of thousands of dangerous offenders and putting MS-13 gang members straight into your children's schools.” On Nov. 4, Trump said: “Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure on ridiculous, endless foreign wars. Most of you have never even heard of some of these countries.... A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalist, Communist, Socialist, the wealthy, liberal, hypocrites who want to silence, censor, cancel, and punish you.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/19/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
