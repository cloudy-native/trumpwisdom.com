They oppose voter ID. Think of it: Voter ID....They want -- we want proof of citizenship, a Social Security number requirement. They don't want any of this to happen. And they want no signature verification. They don't want to have a verified signature.”","analysis":"Joe Biden and Democrats do not oppose election integrity. Thirty-four states have identification laws for voting, including seven with photo ID requirements. But there are few documented cases of in-person voter fraud, and minorities and the elderly make up a disproportionate percentage of the people without government-issued IDs. In other words, voter ID laws are not likely what preserves the integrity of the election.
