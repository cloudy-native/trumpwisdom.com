Experts say the administration has definitely slowed the pace of new regulations, but they have not done much to get rid of regulations. Yet the administration continues to oversell its achievements with hyped statistics. At least 22 of the 67 claimed actions were started under President Barack Obama, and many others were relatively inconsequential steps. The 22-to-1 figure is especially not credible, as even analysts sympathetic to the administration’s mission have said it is overstated.
