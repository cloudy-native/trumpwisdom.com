And then, I see them the third year and I say, wait a minute, let's get this straight. You mean you come up here every three years to beg for money. He said we beg for money and we feel like beggars, he's -- the one gentleman was great. He told me exactly those words. He said they make his comeback every year. Obama never did it, Obama never did it. And I said so, wait, here's what we're going to do. We're going to get you long-term funding and here's what I did, I got them more money than they were asking for, and now for a 10-year period. And I said the only bad news is I may never see you again.”","analysis":"Trump regularly touts his support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), often with a lengthy, anecdotal story that appears to be invented and has little basis in reality. He's referring to bipartisan legislation, dubbed the FUTURE Act, that the Congress passed in December, 2019. The legislation extended $255 million in annual STEM funding for minority-serving colleges, including roughly $85 million specifically allocated to HBCUs. Obama had put in place <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/president-obama-signs-executive-order-promoting-excellence-innovation-and-sustainab\">a ten-year programming stream</a> but Trump had let it lapse. (Trump often makes it sound as if Obama refused to do this and Trump had to come to the rescue.) Moreover, the funding for HBCUs is a congressional initiative. “Congress does all this work and presents it to him in the budget, and he can choose to sign it. This year [2019], he held off on signing some significant STEM funding, making HBCUs beg for it,” said Marybeth Gasman, a Rutgers professor and one of the leading authorities on HBCUs. “Most HBCU support is the result of Congress. Trump has promised all kinds of things to HBCUs and has followed through on little. Under Trump, the White House Initiative for HBCUs was moved to the White House and is quite quiet compared to the work under President Obama’s administration.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Education","repeated_ids":"30380, 29833, 29919, 30295, 30322, 30528, 29304, 29379, 28282, 27002, 26734, 26768, 27277, 27548, 26386, 26322, 25413, 25318, 25371, 25215, 25079, 24958, 23480, 23267, 23118, 22116, 22078, 21937, 21914, 22466, 21890, 22137, 21349, 21276, 20667, 20110, 20060, 19983, 20218, 20190, 20197, 19877, 20315, 19879, 19880, 19878","repeated_count":"46","date":"10/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
