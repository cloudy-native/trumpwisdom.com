And a negative 30% voted for President Trump. Now, think of that. In order to get to the numbers, 130% of the voters -- that's a little tough to get, okay? -- had to vote for him; and minus 30 had to vote for me. And that gets you to 100% and nobody has 100% voting.”","analysis":"Shiva Ayyadura, who has engineering degrees from MIT, is a failed GOP Senate candidate in Massachusetts with a history of controversy.  He <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/5fJO3iwhmQg\">claimed</a> that a computer simulation of the votes in Maricopa County showed the result was only possible under a scenario that weighted all Democrat votes at 130% and Trump’s votes at –30%.
