He's Da Nang Dick. That's Blumenthal. He talked about, \"When I was in Da Nang province in Vietnam and I was fighting up the hill in Minner going left and right of me they're dying. They're being struck by bullets but I went back to their rescue. I went back and I got them. And then I made a second attempt and bullets are going left and right and over my shoulders and they're hitting my men.\" And I used to think, \"Wow, this guy is a pretty brave guy.\" And then I found out he's a fraud. He never was in Vietnam.”","analysis":"This is false. Blumenthal never described himself as a war hero, never said he fought in Da Nang and the Blumenthal remarks and news articles identified by the Times as false or misleading covered a nine-year period from 2000 to 2009, not 15 years.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"25635, 25788, 25790, 7551, 6877, 6955, 5428, 5342, 5318, 5319, 5799, 5800, 5801, 5187, 5199, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5790","repeated_count":"19","date":"10/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
