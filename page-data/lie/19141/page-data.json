Some states with almost none. West Virginia hung in for a long time, as you know, with none -- for a long time.”","analysis":"Many states were slow to start testing because of restrictions and the CDC’s botched first round of tests and so reporting a smaller number of cases later may not have been because there were not cases. Plus, a small number of cases does not mean that states do not need coronavirus testing. It could very well mean the opposite depending on the percent of tests that return positive. The World Health Organization recommends states should be below five percent before opening their economies.
