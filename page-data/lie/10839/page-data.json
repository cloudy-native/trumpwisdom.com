No, but if we had -- if there was a gun on the other side...If one or two or three of those people had a gun.”","analysis":"The November 2015 Paris attacks were a series of coordinated terrorist attacks. The attackers killed 130 people, including 90 at the Bataclan theatre. Another 413 people were injured. Three groups, comprising three men each, executed the attacks, so it's unclear what one person with a gun might have done. When police launched an assault, two attackers at the theater died by detonating their suicide vests.","pinocchios":"","category":"Terrorism","repeated_ids":"10839, 10201, 6438","repeated_count":"3","date":"06/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
