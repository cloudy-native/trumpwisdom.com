I wouldn't want to go to it, no. If you did have it, it's the Democrats' fault. And I accepted the first one, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished because people learned during that shutdown all about the problems coming in from the southern border. I accept -- I've always accepted it.”","analysis":"Trump vacillated between accepting responsibility for the recent government shutdown and pinning blame on Democrats. He now rationalizes the shutdown as worthwhile because the public supposedly learned more about problems at the border. But the public has been hearing a torrent of false and misleading claims from the Trump administration on immigration and border issues since Day One.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
