And they're paying 1 percent, and they're supposed to be at 2 percent. And the 2 percent is very low; it should be much more than that.

But Germany has not been making payment.”","analysis":"Since 2006, each NATO member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending, with a goal of reaching that level by 2024.
