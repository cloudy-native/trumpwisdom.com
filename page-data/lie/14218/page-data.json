But it had a 50 percent approval rating for Trump on Oct. 16, while most other polls were well below that. The polling gurus at {FiveThirtyEight} say that an adjusted rating would have shown Trump at 43 percent in the poll. On the day of the tweet, Trump had an average approval of 41.6 percent in 538's blended poll rating, along with 53.8 percent disapproval. That's lower than any modern president other than Jimmy Carter at this point in his presidency.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"28021, 28137, 28281, 27049, 24988, 25134, 24708, 24589, 24162, 22040, 21007, 21543, 22136, 21343, 21760, 21383, 21375, 17861, 16957, 16988, 16602, 16060, 15896, 15017, 15761, 15627, 14218, 13760, 13196, 12807, 12813, 12924, 11473, 11148, 11008, 10315, 10124, 9914, 9664, 9480, 9307, 8913, 8812, 8858, 8676, 8683, 8708, 8606, 7267, 7545, 7006, 5561, 5317, 4738, 2726, 2685, 2625, 2281, 1870, 1492, 0662, 0667, 0665, 0087","repeated_count":"64","date":"10/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
