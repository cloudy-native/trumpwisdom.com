We’re showcasing products from all around the country that are stamped with the beautiful letters 'Made in the USA.'”","analysis":"Of course, Trump himself has a long history of outsourcing a variety of his products and has acknowledged doing so. Even during Trump’s “Made in America” week, when he urged manufacturers and consumers to “buy American, hire American,” his family’s company continued to rely on foreign workers. Another of Trump’s golf courses recently filed a request to hire 10 foreign workers to be waiters. Further, the fashion line of Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser to the president, is out of step with the principles championed by her father.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"25257, 26575, 25897, 24773, 21835, 21296, 20092, 14598, 13169, 13174, 12195, 11003, 10254, 9546, 8961, 4233, 2483, 2536, 1620, 1465, 1260, 1209, 1135, 1089, 1032, 0941, 0891, 0872, 0874, 0811, 0797, 0472, 0417, 0404, 0418, 0329, 0278, 0269, 0233, 0241, 0208","repeated_count":"41","date":"07/20/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
