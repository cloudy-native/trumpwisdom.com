But in a news briefing that same day, Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of the WHO’s emerging diseases unit, told reporters: “From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission. It is still early days, we don't have a clear clinical picture.” Van Kerkhove added, however, that human-to-human transmission would not be surprising given the WHO’s experience with SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and other respiratory pathogens. The Telegraph in Britain headlined its article on the news conference: “WHO refuses to rule out human-to-human spread in China’s mystery coronavirus outbreak.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
