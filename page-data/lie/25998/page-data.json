You didn't go to Delaware State. You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class.”","analysis":"Trump is repeating a falsehood promoted by his campaign, even though it’s being denied by the university. “Watched in full context, it is clear that Biden was discussing his long association with historically Black colleges and universities, not making a claim that he had attended Delaware State University,” Carlos Holmes, a spokesman for the university, said in a statement to the Delaware News Journal. In the video, the former vice president was not implying that he attended the university, but rather referring to the support he received from the school when he announced his bid for U.S. Senate on the DSU campus in 1972, Holmes said. Biden has admitted he was not the most hard-working student at University of Delaware. He graduated 76th out of 85 at Syracuse Law School.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
