Number one is three years of legislative relief for 700,000 DACA recipients brought here unlawfully by their parents at a young age many years ago. This extension will give them access to work permits, Social Security numbers, and protection from deportation, most importantly. Secondly, our proposal provides a three-year extension of temporary protected status or TPS.”","analysis":"Trump frames this as trying to build \"trust and goodwill.\" But both DACA recipients and TPS people are at risk because of actions taken by the Trump administration. Moreover, the 700,000 figure for DACA is far lower than most Democrats would consider; it reflects the number of people accepted into the DACA program but an estimated 3.6 million undocumented immigrants were brought to the country before their 18th birthday.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
