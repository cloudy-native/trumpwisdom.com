They've taken advantage of our country, the European Union, for many, many years.”","analysis":"The E.U. and the U.S. have the largest bilateral trade relationship in the world. On average, tariffs are relatively low — averaging around 2 percent. There are products where tariffs are steeper, but that is also two-sided. The E.U. does have a 10 percent tariff on cars, but the U.S. imposes a 14 percent tariff on train cars.
