They went down 27% GDP.”","analysis":"Trump's efforts to dismantle the Iran deal negotiated by Obama have been rejected by European allies and Iran has ramped up its nuclear efforts. Given the poor diplomatic results, Trump keeps claiming Iran is eager to negotiate a new deal but there is no evidence of that. As for the 28 percent decline in GDP, we have no idea where Trump got this figure but he appears to have misplaced a decimal point. The United Nations projected in January Iran's GDP would decline 2.7 percent in 2020 -- not 27 percent as Trump claims. After the coronavirus pandemic affected the worldwide economy, the International Monetary Fund projected a 6 percent decline in real GDP. Other reports suggest a decline as much as 11 percent. But that is still not close to 28 percent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29449, 28668, 28004, 28258, 26846, 26677, 27193, 27330, 26393, 25727, 25577, 25262, 25028, 24739, 23799","repeated_count":"15","date":"10/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
