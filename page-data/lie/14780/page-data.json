When Trump first ran for president, he claimed he could easily eliminate the debt in eight years. But instead in his first term he's let the debt skyrocket despite a good economy. Generally the deficit decreases during boom times, but it's increased under Trump because of his tax cut and profligate spending.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
