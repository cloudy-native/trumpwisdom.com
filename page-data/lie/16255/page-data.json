You know what they said to me? I said, ‘Don’t worry about it, we're going to take care of you guys.’ And I used a bad word. You know what word I used? We're going to get you a subsidy, and they said this two years ago. I said, ‘How much were you targeted for?’ This was the first year. ‘Twelve billion, sir.’ The second year was 16 [billion]. They were a target; that’s what they didn’t get from China. So I said, ‘It’s all right. We're going to give you a subsidy of the same and we're going to take it out of the tariffs and we're gonna have billions and billions of dollars left over.’ And they said, ‘Sir, we don't want money. We just want a level playing field.’”","analysis":"It’s difficult to imagine that the $12 billion estimate, which became U.S. policy in the form of farm subsidies, surfaced on the fly at this meeting. In any case, the Trump tariffs have garnered about $39 billion on products from China through December, according to Customs and Border Protection, and the administration has announced $28 billion in farm subsidies over two years to offset domestic producers’ losses from the trade war. That means most of the China tariff revenue has been largely eaten up by payments the government has made to farmers who lost business because China stopped buying U.S. soybeans, hogs, cotton and other products.
