Trump has no evidence that Schiff \"knowingly lied\" when he cited the frequent contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian entities as evidence of possible collusion. A summary of the special counsel's report, released by Attorney General William Barr, concluded the investigation \"did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\" The special counsel defined “coordination” as an “agreement — tacit or express — between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference.” The full report has not been released.
