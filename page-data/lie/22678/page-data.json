But if you look at Russia, Russia became Russia from the Soviet Union because of Afghanistan. They lost a fortune and a lot of people -- a lot of people. So I don't know why they'd be doing it. But if you tell me they're doing it, I will certainly take that under consideration.”","analysis":"After numerous news reports that U.S. intelligence believed that Russia was paying the Taliban bounties to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Trump has falsely tried to dismiss it as a \"hoax\" ginned up by Democrats. Intelligence analysts believe that the bounties probably resulted in the deaths of three Marines killed in April 2019 when the vehicle they were traveling in was blown up just outside Bagram, the main U.S. air base in Afghanistan, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/democrats-assail-administration-officials-for-not-forcing-trump-to-address-russian-operation-targeting-us-troops/2020/06/30/4744f408-badf-11ea-80b9-40ece9a701dc_story.html\">The Washington Post reported</a>. The intelligence reports were contained in the presidential daily brief, which Trump is said not to read carefully, but apparently Trump's briefer did not bring the subject to his attention. Several people familiar with the matter told The Post that information is sometimes withheld from Trump, who often reacts badly to reports that he thinks might undermine what he considers his good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"21262, 22742, 22678, 20899, 20678, 20602, 20608","repeated_count":"7","date":"07/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
