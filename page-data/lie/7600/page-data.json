Whatever he did, he did on his own. He's a lawyer. A lawyer who represents a client is supposed to do the right thing, that's why you pay them a lot of money, et cetera, et cetera. He is a lawyer, he represents a client. I never directed him to do any incorrect or wrong. And he understands that.”","analysis":"Trump Attorney Michael Cohen testified that Trump did direct him to violate campaign finance laws. Trump ignores the fact that American Media Inc. publisher of the National Enquirer, is also involved because it made payments to payments to Karen McDougal. Both Cohen and AMI have stated under penalty of perjury that the payments were meant to influence the election. AMI told the government that in August 2015 — a year before the McDougal payment — its chief executive, David Pecker, had met with Cohen and an unnamed campaign official (said to be Trump) to offer to help cover up any negative stories that might emerge. It then did so, paying McDougal $150,000 “to suppress the model’s story so as to prevent it from influencing the election,” as the agreement with the government reads. That, by itself, is illegal, but AMI won't be charged under its agreement with the government.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"9222, 9205, 8144, 7753, 7626, 7595, 7596, 7597, 7599, 7600, 7603, 7618, 7619, 7592, 7265, 7296","repeated_count":"16","date":"12/13/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
