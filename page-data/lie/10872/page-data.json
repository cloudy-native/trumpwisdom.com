Why has he fallen like a rock? What the hell happened to Beto? So we went to El Paso and I made a speech and we had an arena that holds 8 or 9,000 people, the arena was packed. We had 35,000 people outside we had these massive movie screens outside, so those people that couldn't get in could see. He had 502 people.”","analysis":"Trump overestimates his crowd size and underestimates the crowd for a competing rally held in El Paso by former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.). He claimed that the Fire Department permitted 10,000 in the arena, but a Fire Department spokesman said 6,500 people were inside the venue and denied any special accommodations were made. (Several thousand, though, were outside the Coliseum, watching the president's speech on big screens.) An O'Rourke spokesman said about 8,000 attended the counter-rally. However, the El Paso Police Department told the El Paso Times that officers had made no official estimates.","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"13769, 10872, 10177, 8795, 8677, 8678, 8697, 8712","repeated_count":"8","date":"05/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
