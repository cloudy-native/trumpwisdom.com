I did a ban very early. If I didn't do that ban, you would have lost hundreds of thousands of more people in this country. It was a very important ban. People don't like talking about the ban. No, but it was very important. I was the only one that wanted to do it, and we did it, and we saved thousands of lives -- hundreds of thousands of lives, probably.”","analysis":"The Trump administration imposed an entry ban on all foreign nationals who were in the People’s Republic of China, excluding Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, in the previous 14 days, effective Feb. 2. Trump frequently claims he took bold action that was criticized, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">news reports say</a> he had been reluctant to impose the ban, citing his relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but the action was urged by his top health advisers.  The virus was already spreading through the United States and there is little evidence it saved lives, especially since the Trump administration did not rapidly set up an effective testing regime like many other countries.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28381, 28850, 27712, 26301, 25480, 24921, 24951, 24268, 24038, 23373, 23690, 22084, 22081, 21960, 21028, 21597, 22483, 22259, 21356, 21246, 20835, 21079, 20671, 20039, 19944, 18761, 19393, 19338, 19784, 18990, 19752, 19215, 18868, 18825, 19574, 18756, 19260, 19263, 18708, 18938, 19178, 19189, 18617, 19433, 19108, 19024, 18514, 17894, 17698, 17692, 18497, 17870, 17985, 17624, 17640, 17862, 17863, 18077, 17565, 17542, 18443, 17857, 17860, 18127","repeated_count":"64","date":"05/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
