It's made a tremendous difference. That was a terrible agreement, and we renegotiated it and it's now a very good agreement for the United States. ”","analysis":"Trump is referring to a free-trade agreement with South Korea that was negotiated by the President George W. Bush’s administration and then tweaked by President Barack Obama’s administration; Trump also made some modest changes, mainly to encourage more exports of automobiles to South Korea. The new version doubles the number of vehicles each American auto company can export to South Korea without meeting Korean safety standards, but most analysts were skeptical it would make much of a difference because Koreans are not especially interested in American models. The new agreement took effect on Jan. 1, 2019, and the International Trade Administration <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.trade.gov/td/otm/assets/auto/New_Passenger_Exports.pdf\">says</a> the value of passenger cars and light truck exports to South Korea has risen 14 percent in the Jan-to-June period of 2019, compared to the same period the year before. The value of exports grew nine percent from 2017 to 2018, however, so this is hardly a \"tremendous difference.\" Meanwhile, ITA data <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.trade.gov/td/otm/assets/auto/New_Passenger_Imports.pdf\">shows</a> that South Korean exports of vehicles to the United States grew almost 20 percent in the first half of 2019; U.S. imports of Korean vehicles are eight times higher than exports of U.S. vehicles to South Korea.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
