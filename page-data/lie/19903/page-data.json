These are not people that are nice people. I saw on your network today, John -- I saw what went on with the hitting and the punching and the beating and all the other things going on in Seattle. And you have a governor that doesn't do a damn thing about it. And you have a mayor that doesn't know she's alive. She's talking about, 'It's going to be a lovefest this summer.' No, if they don't do the job, I'll do the job, and I've already spoken to the Attorney General about it.”","analysis":"Trump exaggerates about Seattle's Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ). Mayor Jenny Durkan described as \"four blocks in Seattle that is more like a block party atmosphere. It's not an armed takeover. It's not a military junta. We will make sure that we will restore this but we have block parties and the like in this part of Seattle all the time ... there is no threat right now to the public.\" CHAZ was established on June 8 and cleared of occupants by police on July 1 after some violence occurred. But that was not the case at the time of these remarks. No evidence of Antifa involvement emerged.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
