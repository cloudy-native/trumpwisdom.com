Like, this character on '60 Minutes, they're putting him on. This guy -- we had so many things. He's talking about how honest the election is. Well, how come there are thousands of dead people voting? How come there are all these other people voting that shouldn't be voting? How come we find thousands of votes? How come poll watchers -- every vote that went through an election area, a count -- what -- they call it a counting area, where our poll watchers were locked out of the building outside, standing outside, or standing so far away that you couldn't see, where they literally went out and sent for binoculars -- you're supposed to be right next to that vote. Well, every one of them is a fraud. So, how can he say -- I mean, other than he's an anti-Trumper, how can this guy say that there was no fraud?”","analysis":"Chris Krebs, a lifelong Republican, was put in charge of the agency handling election security by Trump two years before the election.

There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes or changed votes or was in any way compromised.\" Krebs <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/election-results-security-chris-krebs-60-minutes-2020-11-29/\">appeared</a> on \"60 Minutes\" the day of Trump's interview on Fox's Sunday Morning Futures to discuss his firing. There is no evidence he was a \"never-Trumper\" before his firing; his sin was that he told the truth ","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
