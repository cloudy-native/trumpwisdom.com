I said, 'No, Shinzo, you gotta do it. You gotta do it. It's not fair, you're sending too many cars, and they're built in Japan.' We wanted them built in Michigan.

And he retired.”","analysis":"This story is faintly ridiculous in Trump's telling. One can see Trump pressing the Japanese prime minister to force Japanese companies to invest in the United States and Abe explaining that's not how the free market system works. Depending on the venue, Trump sometimes says the next day five auto plants were announced in Michigan -- <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-claims-he-rewarded-voters-in-michigan-by-persuading-japans-abe-to-get-car-companies-to-put-plants-there-that-didnt-happen-2020-09-22\">false</a> -- or five auto companies made announcements or he simply says \"five companies.\" None of that happened. (There were five new investments by Japanese automakers in Michigan, but only one of them is a manufacturing facility, which was announced on Jan. 30, 2017, just 10 days after Trump took office.) The Financial Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://qz.com/905892/japans-shinzo-abe-will-promise-to-invest-more-in-the-us-but-that-probably-wont-shrink-the-trade-deficit-between-the-two-countries/\">reported</a> that Abe requested that Japanese companies thinking of investing in the United States come up with a \"tweetable\" figure for investment. He later gave Trump a chart that listed seven companies making investments, for a total of 14,300 jobs, but these were not all new factories. Moreover, Japanese companies <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/09/trumps-false-auto-industry-claims/\">invested more</a> in the 2014-2016 period before Trump became president.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"30444, 29604, 28649, 27959, 24636","repeated_count":"5","date":"11/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
