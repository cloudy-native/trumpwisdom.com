Customs and Border Patrol <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/cbp-enforcement-statistics\">reported</a> it seized 13052 lbs (or 5920 kg) of heroin and 3956 lbs (or 1794 kg) of fentanyl between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019.  That’s far below Trump’s assessment. Still, not all seizures happen at the border. A recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported 8000 kg of heroin were seized in 2017, but did not list any data for 2018 or 2019.
