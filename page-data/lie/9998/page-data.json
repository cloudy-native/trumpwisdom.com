He often refers to a six-percent decline, which is a carefully-parsed figure. It refers not to crime or even across the country; it's the one year decline in the murder rate in America’s largest cities. The overall murder rate has barely changed under Trump, going from 5.4 per 100,000 people in 2016 to 5.3 in 2017, or a decline of 1.4 percent.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"23509, 21388, 20213, 20129, 20171, 15362, 15185, 15186, 10198, 9998, 9912, 9188, 8777","repeated_count":"13","date":"04/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
