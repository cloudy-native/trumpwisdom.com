Last year, approximately 70,000 people claimed this status statewide. This year, the number miraculously was nearly 250,000 voters after election officials in Milwaukee and Dane Counties, a couple of the most corrupt political places in our country, urged citizens to improperly register under this status, and register they did in levels that don't exist.”","analysis":"There was an increase in these sorts of voters, but not quite as high as Trump says. Reid Magney, spokesman for the elections commission, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/21/joe-sanfelippo/voters-not-clerks-decided-who-was-indefinitely-con/\">said</a> about 215,000 ballots were returned in the Nov. 3 election from voters listed as indefinitely confined. But Trump really goes off the rails in suggesting some sort of corrupt political machine was behind this increase. Clerks don't determine who is on the list as this implies, they simply record which voters list themselves this way. They don't even have the authority to remove someone from it. It would make sense that during a pandemic more people would be defined as indefinitely confined -- and state officials had encouraged people to take advantage of that provision of the law.
