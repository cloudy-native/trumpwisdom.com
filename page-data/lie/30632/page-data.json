They are not showing the matching signatures. Call off the recount until they allow the MATCH. Don't let the Radical Left Dems STEAL THE ELECTION!”","analysis":"The Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, had ordered a hand recount of all ballots in Georgia, where Biden narrowly edged out Trump by about 11,000 votes. Trump complained that signatures are not being looked at as part of the recount. That’s because they were already looked at — and verified — when the ballots were originally counted. In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GASecretaryofState\">Facebook posts</a>, Raffensperger rebutted the president’s claims. “For the first time in the history of Georgia, Absentee ballots submitted through our electronic portal required photo ID,” Raffensperger wrote in one post. “My team — we made that happen.” He added: “Let’s address this disinformation about signature match. We strengthened signature match. We helped train election officials on GBI [Georgia Bureau of Investigation] signature match — which is confirmed twice before a ballot is ever cast.” (The signature is checked when a person requests an absentee ballot and then again when the ballot is returned.) Trump frequently urged Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to step in and order a review of signatures -- even though he did not have the power to do so. Georgia elections official Gabe Sterling said the secretary of state’s office brought in signature experts, who examined more than 15,000 mail-in ballot envelopes. They found potential problems with only two, and upon investigation, both ballots turned out to be legitimate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31141, 31264, 31256, 31496, 31025, 31101, 31006, 31091, 31071, 31057, 31564, 31553, 31472, 31473, 31471, 30977, 30883, 30885, 30825, 30877, 30880, 30868, 31411, 30610, 30620, 30700, 30690, 30678, 30658, 30642, 30632, 30601","repeated_count":"32","date":"11/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
