Restore catch and release. Shield violent criminal aliens. This is what they want to do. And give every illegal alien on the planet earth a free ticket to invent an asylum claim, and gain automatic admission into our country. We will have people coming into our country that never even thought of it before.”","analysis":"Our colleagues at FactCheck.org <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/07/trump-distorts-bidens-immigration-plans/\">produced</a> a good rundown of the various things that Trump gets wrong about Biden's immigration policies. For instance, Trump falsely has said the Biden-Sanders task force wanted to end the practice of detaining immigrants who enter the country illegally. The task force recommends closing for-profit detention centers, and Biden has called for ending “prolonged detention,” not all detentions. He falsely has said it would grant asylum to “all new illegal aliens.” The task force said it would “end Trump Administration policies that deny protected entry to asylum seekers,” and “expand the existing asylum system.” It doesn't say for everyone. Trump also falsely has said it wanted an end to prosecutions of those who cross the border illegally. It calls for scrapping the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy and focusing on prosecuting “human traffickers, smugglers” and other serious criminals.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"28801, 28992, 29028, 28305, 27993, 27812, 27630, 27677, 28234, 26785, 26621, 27067, 27408, 26208, 23181, 23077, 22015, 21578, 22843","repeated_count":"19","date":"08/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
