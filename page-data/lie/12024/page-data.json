I would say I wonder how that happened because the first quarter is the weakest quarter [Inaudible] almost our weakest and we had this great quarter but I don't consider 3.2 great, I consider much higher and frankly if we had lower interest rates we are forced to pay more money than other countries because we have a rate that is high, we have somebody that likes raising rates. I think he is maybe going to change but we will find out but if we had lower we would have another 10,000 points.”","analysis":"Nope. Looking at the last 30 years of GDP data, the first quarter often was among the strongest. The U.S. last had first-quarter GDP growth above 3 percent in 2015. There is no basis for Trump's claim that GDP growth and stock market gains would soar without higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve has raised rates to prevent the economy from overheating and falling into recession.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
