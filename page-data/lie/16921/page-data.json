We had transcribers -- professional transcribers. Then they said, 'Oh, well, maybe the transcription is not correct.' But Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother -- right? -- we had some people that -- really amazing. But we did everything. We said, 'What's wrong with it?' 'Well, they didn't add this word or that one.' It didn't matter. I said, 'Add it. They're probably wrong, but add it.' So now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate.”","analysis":"It was not an exact transcript. The memo released by the White House includes a “caution” note saying it “is not a verbatim transcript.” Current and former U.S. officials studying the document pointed to several elements that, they say, indicate that the document may have been handled in an unusual way, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/03/odd-markings-ellipses-fuel-doubts-about-rough-transcript-trumps-ukraine-call/\">the Washington Post reported.</a> Those include the use of ellipses — punctuation indicating that information has been deleted for clarity or other reasons — that traditionally have not appeared in summaries of presidential calls with foreign leaders. Moreover, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, told House impeachment investigators that the White House transcript of a July call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president omitted crucial words and phrases, and that his attempts to include them failed.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"29891, 28624, 26798, 25735, 24796, 24596, 19011, 18008, 18121, 16921, 16769, 16636, 16668, 16117, 16023, 15402, 14513, 14455, 15735, 14337, 14500, 15267, 14318, 14322, 14307, 14310, 14313, 14315, 15168, 14108, 14180, 14621, 13991, 13904, 15036, 13752, 13576, 12909, 12880","repeated_count":"39","date":"02/06/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
