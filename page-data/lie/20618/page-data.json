During four separate trips that started with the one in 1492, Columbus landed on various Caribbean islands that are now the Bahamas as well as the island later called Hispaniola. He also explored the Central and South American coasts. But he didn't reach North America, which was already inhabited by Native Americans, and he never thought he had found a new continent. Norse explorer Leif Erikson is credited with having reached Canada some 500 years before Columbus was born.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/04/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
