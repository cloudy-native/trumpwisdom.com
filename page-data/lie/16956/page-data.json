Gee, that sounds very fair! Rogue prosecutors maybe? The Swamp!”","analysis":"Presidents have typically avoided interfering in Justice Department decisions to avoid allegations of improper influence. Here, Trump contradicts his own Justice Department, which said after Trump confidant Roger Stone was convicted: “Stone was found guilty of obstruction of a congressional investigation, five counts of making false statements to Congress, and tampering with a witness.” Four prosecutors on the case withdrew after the Justice Department pulled back a sentencing recommendation of roughly seven to nine years. In the end, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson sentenced Stone to 40 months in prison.  “Witnesses do not get to decide for themselves whether Congress is entitled to the facts,” Jackson said.
