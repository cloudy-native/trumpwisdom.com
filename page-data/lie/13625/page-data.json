They never do -- we used to have a thing called \"fact-checking.\" They don't do fact-checking anymore. They used to call and say, \"What about this? What about that?\" How can they do a thing like that and destroy somebody's life? I mean, they're destroying lives.”","analysis":"Reputable news organizations will check for comment from the White House or officials under scrutiny before running a story. When Trump doesn't like what's being reported, he calls it fake news. But in almost every case, the reports are proven to be accurate and the substance of Trump's complaint is that the facts reflect poorly on him. Reputable news organizations follow ethical rules and correct mistakes promptly, something Trump knows since he often celebrates these corrections on Twitter. These overheated comments are not based in facts.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
