Mueller also made money for the government, namely by seizing properties and assets from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort that could well defease the entire cost of his investigation in the final accounting. Trump falsely claims that the Russia investigation had an \"illegal\" origin. But his own appointee, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, authorized the special counsel investigation and selected Robert Mueller to lead it. Multiple judges upheld Mueller's appointment. Trump calls it a witch hunt, but Mueller indicted numerous individuals, including Manafort. Trump calls it \"perhaps even Spying\" and also suggests it was \"treason,\" a crime punishable by death, but those claims are unfounded.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
