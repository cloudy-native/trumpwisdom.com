And I remember India before. Now, not intimately, but I remember India before, and it was very torn. There was a lot of dissension, a lot of fighting. And he brought it all together, like a father would bring it together. Maybe he's the father of India.”","analysis":"This is false. Modi has long been a divisive figure in India, in part because he leads the Bharatiya Janata Party, a center-right political party built around Hindu nationalism, the idea that India — home to a diversity of religions — is fundamentally a Hindu nation, not a secular republic. That presents a distinctly different world view than India’s Congress party.
