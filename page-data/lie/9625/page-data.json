Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!”","analysis":"The Trump administration wants to add a question to the 2020 Census asking whether respondents are U.S. citizens. Trump claims the census would be “meaningless” without this “all-important question.” But numerous experts — including those in the Census Bureau — say that adding a citizenship question would depress response rates by intimidating immigrants fearing potential deportation. (The census is supposed to count all residents, not just citizens.) The citizenship question has been blocked by three federal judges and is pending before the Supreme Court. The lower-court judges listed serious concerns about Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross’s decision-making process. Ross oversees the Census Bureau and overruled career officials who had recommended against adding the question because it would skew the accuracy of the census. The judges said Ross’s decision to add the question was based on a false premise. Ross testified in Congress that the Justice Department “initiated the request” for the citizenship question to gather better data to protect voting rights for minorities. But it was later revealed in court proceedings that Ross was behind the question all along and pressured the Justice Department to make a formal request.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
