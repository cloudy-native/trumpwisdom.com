I have a nasty transaction with him and then all of the sudden he is my prosecutor. Very, very unfair.”","analysis":"The Mueller report sharply disputes Trump's characterization of this as a \"nasty business transaction\" or a conflict of interest. It says that Steve Bannon \"told the President that the golf course dispute did not rise to the level of a conflict and claiming one was 'ridiculous and petty.' The President did not respond when Bannon pushed back on the stated conflicts of interest.\" In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5955249/Report.pdf#page=292\">a footnote</a>, Mueller recounts: \"In October 2011, Mueller resigned his family's membership from Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, in a letter that noted that 'we live in the District and find that we are unable to make full use of the Club' and that inquired 'whether we would be entitled to a refund of a portion of our initial membership fee,' which was paid in 1994. About two weeks later, the controller of the club responded that the Muellers' resignation would be effective October 31, 2011, and that they would be 'placed on a waitlist to be refunded on a first resigned / first refunded basis' in accordance with the club's legal documents. The Muellers have not had further contact with the club.\" Career ethics officials in the Justice Department cleared Mueller to investigate Trump in May 2017.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"29797, 30459, 28072, 25594, 24537, 23434, 20513, 17112, 17187, 16091, 16463, 16006, 15481, 14358, 14415, 13759, 13842, 13611, 12957, 13677, 12149, 12039, 12029, 11944, 11863, 11169, 11189, 11774, 11116, 11095, 10915, 10746, 10728, 10717, 10437, 10958, 10960, 10537, 10541, 10542, 10932, 10129, 10283, 9953, 10146, 10149, 10114, 9764, 10021, 10073, 9917, 9824, 9738, 9740, 9346, 9085, 8702, 8050, 7582, 7583, 7584, 7269, 7266, 6580, 6535, 7516, 7211, 7213, 6999, 7452, 5056, 5057, 5040, 5969, 4818, 4756, 4497, 4357, 4406, 4479, 4383, 4469, 4274, 4532, 3611, 3628, 3647, 3388, 3421, 3920, 3930, 3289, 3291, 3241, 3242, 3180, 3248, 3062, 3041, 2944, 2614, 0723","repeated_count":"102","date":"04/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
