Amazon and other companies like it, they come and they drop all their mail into a Post Office, not all of it, but a big percentage of it, and they say here, you deliver it you stupid people, you deliver it. And it costs us every time they drop a package, it costs us like $3 to deliver the package for them, $3 a package, we're losing a fortune. I said, you've got to raise their rates, you're going to have to raise their rates. But Amazon, they build their big plant, always near a Post Office, and then they take a lot of this mail into areas where they could never go, because the postal system is massive and they drop packages into the Post Office by the thousands, and then they -- you -- when I say thousands, for one -- some little place and they drop them, but drop them and then they say here, you deliver them, and we lose $3 and $4 a package, on average we lose massive amounts of money.”","analysis":"The president says the U.S. Postal Service loses money on every package it delivers for e-commerce merchants. But that appears to be an analysis derived more from his gut — or his animus toward Amazon — than from any sophisticated analysis of the numbers. USPS, by its own calculation, says revenue from package deliveries far exceeds costs. With Amazon perhaps seeking to bypass USPS, the agency must be careful not to price itself out of the market — and thus face a bigger financial squeeze. Moreover, under the law, USPS is prohibited from losing money in the package-delivery sector. While the Treasury Department claims that USPS's calculations are flawed, it does not offer an alternative way of calculating profits. Indeed, internal USPS documents <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/09/18/trump-amazon-postal-service/\">obtained by The Washington Post</a> found that Amazon generated $3.9 billion in revenue for the agency in the 2019  fiscal year that ended in September. The Postal Service turned a $1.6 billion profit on that business, nearly twice as much as any other customer, according to one memo obtained by The Post.
