And if you remember, Obama didn't want to do that. He didn't want to do that. And we have hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment that will sit in storage for years and years and just get worthless. And I've given it out to the police and they I'm saving so many police lives, a lot of it's protective equipment, and they don't even want to do that.”","analysis":"This is overstated. The Obama administration scaled back the federal government's program of providing surplus military gear such as tanks and weapons to local police departments, a response to the images of militarized police during the unrest in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014. But Obama's restrictions clearly laid out a category of \"controlled equipment\" such as specialized firearms, manned and unmanned aircraft, explosives and riot gear that could still be provided upon demonstrated need.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
