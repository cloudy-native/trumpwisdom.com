In less than one hour, and then a vote, the problem would be solved.

After a meeting in September 2017 with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the two Democrats announced they had reached a deal with Trump that did not fund the border wall but extended protections for Dreamers. Trump took a beating from right-wing critics, and eventually said there had been no deal. The immigration laws he says were \"Democrat inspired\" are actually a collection of policies from both parties.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/30/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
