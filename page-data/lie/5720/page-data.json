And President Obama essentially said the same thing. He was ready to go to war. You would have had a war and you would have lost millions, not thousands.”","analysis":"Trump goes far out on a limb by saying the U.S. would be at war with North Korea but for him. And also by saying millions of people would have been killed. There's no evidence Obama ever told Trump a war with North Korea was imminent. The president indicates North Korea has let up its nuclear activities since he and Kim Jong Un signed a vague joint statement on denuclearization June 12. But experts say and satellite imagery indicates that North Korea continues to pursue a nuclear program. The Washington Post reported that U.S. spy agencies are seeing signs that North Korea is constructing new missiles at a factory that produced the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"9159, 9004, 8710, 8352, 8294, 6297, 5328, 5531, 5720, 5157, 4592, 4367, 4302, 4033, 3971, 3924, 16809, 3367, 3305, 3298, 3301, 2949, 2905, 2805, 2632, 2802, 2550, 2489, 2491, 2301, 2075, 2111, 1984, 1955, 1893, 1333, 1317, 1317, 1286, 1286, 1268, 0996, 0580, 0495","repeated_count":"44","date":"09/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
