You're gonna end up in a depression, okay?”","analysis":"Trump keeps saying Biden will cause stock markets to crash and send the country into a depression worse than 1929. But Wall Street is bullish on Biden. Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2020/the-macroeconomic-consequences-trump-vs-biden.pdf\">says</a> \"the economic outlook is strongest under the scenario in which Biden and the Democrats sweep Congress and fully adopt their economic agenda.\" Similarly, Goldman Sachs's chief economist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/19/election-2020-stimulus-goldman-sachs-democratic-sweep.html\">says</a> Biden's policies and expected stimulus spending if Democrats sweep congressional races would “outweigh the negative effects of tax increases, particularly in light of the fact that the increased tax revenue would go to funding new spending.” (After Biden won the presidential election, the stock market went up, despite Trump's numerous predictions of a crash.)
