Sir, we'd like you to sign this order. What is the order? We need five thousand judges on the border. I said, \"Judges?\" What other country has judges? I said, \"How many do we have now?\" They didn't even know. So we have thousands of judges and now we're going to have five thousand.”","analysis":"It’s not clear who told Trump 5,000 judges were needed. But this claim defies logic. The United States had 334 immigration judges as of mid-April, and a top official at the National Association of Immigration Judges says an additional 365 judges would be needed to get through the backlog. A bill by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) would increase the total number of judges to 750, not 5,000. All the Article III judges, hearing all sorts of federal cases, at all the different levels, number only 1,300 or so — not in the thousands.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"4289, 3893, 4182, 3438, 3430, 3435, 3569, 3999, 3978, 3488, 3950","repeated_count":"11","date":"06/25/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
