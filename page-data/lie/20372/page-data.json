Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?”","analysis":"This is a groundless conspiracy theory. Gugino is a longtime activist and peaceful protester with no ties to Antifa. Video of this incident shows he was gesturing with his arm when he was stopped by police before he was brutally knocked over; two police officers were fired. There's no evidence Gugino was using a phone to scan police communications or \"black out the equipment.\" He wasn't carrying a scanner, either.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
