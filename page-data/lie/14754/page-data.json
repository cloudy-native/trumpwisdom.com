Republicans will have a great #2020 Election!”","analysis":"Trump suggests the impeachment inquiry has boosted his poll ratings and that Americans have turned against Democrats. There is little evidence that is the case at the time of these comments. He sometimes relies on individual polls that might be outliers or are contradicted by most other polls. Generally, polling shows more Americans would like to see Trump impeached and even removed from office than Americans who do not. But the testimony does not appear to have increased support or reduced Trump’s already low approval rating even further. Instead, positions have hardened as the inquiry continues.
