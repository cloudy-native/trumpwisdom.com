If my opponent won, this would be a lot of nice, new structures outside. I guess you would have stopped long ago. You would have stopped construction before it started too much....you have thousands of tons of concrete, aluminum and steel, and nearly 6,000 of the strongest, toughest, and most talented workers anywhere on Earth. True. I know. It was the Trump administration that made it possible. No one else. Without us, you would never have been able to do this.”","analysis":"Trump is falsely taking credit. The $6 billion Royal Dutch Shell ethylene cracker facility was first announced in 2012 -- five years before Trump became president. The plant was built with the promise of more than $1 billion in tax credits from state taxpayers, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authorized the project in June 2014. A final decision to build the plant was made in June 2016.
