And that, to me, is a very big factor — very big.”","analysis":"The estate tax affects very few Americans each year. Only about 5,500 estates — out of nearly 3 million estates — would have to pay any taxes in 2017. About half of estates subject to the tax would pay an average tax of about 9 percent. As for farms, only about 50 in a given year are expected to owe tax, according to the Tax Policy Center.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"29210, 25753, 26071, 25278, 24425, 23659, 21982, 19308, 17815, 17591, 18403, 17446, 17521, 18319, 16858, 16710, 16544, 13688, 11070, 10471, 10867, 10243, 9965, 9992, 9671, 9520, 8616, 7826, 7363, 6937, 6679, 6039, 6193, 6360, 6470, 5374, 5849, 4912, 4715, 4553, 4291, 4107, 4156, 4073, 4007, 4024, 3943, 2022, 1817, 1815, 1718, 1246, 1258","repeated_count":"53","date":"12/20/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
