Pyongyang has a long history of making agreements and then not living up to their obligations, but apparently Trump is not aware that the language in earlier agreements was tougher.\nThe third sentence of the statement says that North Korea commits to “work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The phrase is not defined and “toward” is rather weak. In the past, North Korea viewed “denuclearization” to mean the United States removing the nuclear umbrella it provides to Japan and South Korea. There was no indication in the documents that its definition has changed and North Korea later confirmed that that remains its interpretation of the phrase.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/13/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
