Israel signed peace agreements with two countries that had waged war on it -- Egypt in 1977 and Jordan in 1994. But he's ignoring the fact there have also have been a variety of peace agreements with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, responsible for terrorist attacks, that permitted a level of self-rule, principally the Oslo Accords in the mid-1990s. The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain never attacked Israel but had neither recognised Israel nor had formal diplomatic or economic relations with the Jewish state, so these agreements make it less isolated in the region.
