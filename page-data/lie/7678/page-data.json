News reports concerning the Shutdown and Syria are mostly FAKE. We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security (Gangs, Drugs, Human Trafficking & more) but it could be a long stay. On Syria, we were originally going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left. When I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!”","analysis":"At the time of this tweet, there has been virtually no negotiations with Democrats. Congress had thought it had a deal with Trump to push the funding issue into the next year, but Trump suddenly changed his mind after being attack from the right. The first U.S. airstrikes in Syria were in Sept. 2014 and the first deployment of 50 special ops forces was October 2015 (though the CIA may have been operating in Syria as early as 2013). The civil war in Syria started in March 2011, which could be where Trump comes up with seven years. Few of Trump's advisors believe that ISIS is \"largely defeated.\" here are at least 2,000 -- and possibly as many as 8,000 -- militants holed up along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria. They have they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported forces.  The British defense minister, Tobias Ellwood, responded: “I strongly disagree. It has morphed into other forms of extremism and the threat is very much alive.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/22/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
