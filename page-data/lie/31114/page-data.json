We'd be getting 25-30,000 people a rally, and the competition would get less than 100 people. And it never made sense.”","analysis":"Trump has long been obsessed over the size of the crowds at his rallies. In the final days of the election campaign, Trump repeatedly hyped the number of people at his rallies — he rarely attracted more than 25,000 people — and often remarked that his crowds were bigger than any previous American or even world figure. (Not so.) He also knocked Biden for having small crowds, even though the Biden campaign was purposely trying to model good behavior during the pandemic.\n\nIn these comments, Trump echoes something he said often in his final rallies — that he could not possibly lose because of the crowds he attracted. He constantly inflated the size of the “tractor rallies” and “boat rallies” on his behalf. But it’s absurd to believe crowd sizes translate into votes. Many losing presidential campaigns — such as George McGovern’s in 1972 — attracted huge crowds in the last days of the campaign.“The crowds at campaign events were large and enthusiastic,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/george-mcgovern-on-his-1972-presidential-defeat/2012/09/28/dded48fc-f78c-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_4&itid=lk_inline_manual_14\">recalled McGovern in a 2012 article</a>. “I didn't pay undue attention to the polls, and I wasn't overly concerned that there would be no face-to-face debates with Nixon. But when election night came and the early returns revealed one of the most lopsided victories in U.S. history, I was genuinely stunned.” (McGovern lost 49 states to Richard M. Nixon.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
