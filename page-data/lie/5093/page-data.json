There’s no definitive estimate of how many of these jobs were lost or how many of these factories closed specifically because of China. The research on this question is limited, indicating that China had an outsize impact but that there were other factors at play, such as automation.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/25/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
