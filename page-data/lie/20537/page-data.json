Especially China. Are they going to print millions of ballots using the exact same paper, using the exact same machines? And are they going print ballots and then hand them in? And then, all of a sudden -- it's the biggest risk we have: the mail-in ballot, not so much the absentee ballot.”","analysis":"This is nonsense. Absentee and mail-in ballots are essentially the same. Both require voters to register first. Trump indicates that he sometimes votes by mail out of necessity, but CNN reported that he voted by mail at times when he could have gone in-person. Most states do not require a reason for absentee voting, though some do require an excuse. Among other safeguards, states tag mail ballots with barcodes and scan them upon arrival to prevent fraud; many also verify the signature on the ballot is a match with the signature in the voter registration.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
