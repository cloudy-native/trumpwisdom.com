No single interceptor for ICBMs has demonstrated a 97-percent success rate, and there is no guarantee using two interceptors has a 100-percent success rate. Moreover, the military’s suggestion that it could achieve a 97-percent success rate with four interceptors appears based on faulty assumptions and overenthusiastic math. The odds of success under the most ideal conditions are no better than 50-50, and likely worse, as documented in detailed government assessments.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"4841","repeated_count":"1","date":"10/11/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
