I said, 'That's a horrible thing to say.' I'm not blaming him; I'm not blaming anybody. But that's what he told me. Because we were at a position where, with a certain country -- I won't say which one -- we may have had conflict. And he said to me, 'Sir, if you could, delay it, because we're very low on ammunition.' And I said, 'You know what, General? I never want to hear that again from another general.' No President should ever, ever hear that statement, 'We're low on ammunition.' And we now have more ammunition, more missiles, more rockets, more tanks, more -- we have more of everything than we've ever had before. More jet fighters. When I came here, 50 percent of our jet fighters didn't fly.”","analysis":"Trump is onto something when he suggests that munitions were running low at the time he took office. After targeting Islamic State operatives with tens of thousands of smart bombs and guided missiles, U.S. military officials began to say publicly that stockpiles were growing thin. But the president’s disregard for details and accuracy gets him in trouble. Trump never limits his comments to PGMs and instead gives the impression that all ammunition was running out. Smart bombs may be the most important kind in the fight against terror, but it’s nevertheless an exaggerated claim. Moreover, at times Trump’s claim has morphed from “very little” ammunition to “no ammunition.” No military official has claimed that munitions, whether PGMs or for any other kind of weapon, were depleted, and officials in the Obama administration had already started to fix the problem by the time he took office.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30982, 30943, 29444, 29540, 30027, 28582, 28808, 28172, 27690, 27852, 27913, 27734, 28247, 26849, 27147, 27512, 26398, 26476, 26107, 25707, 25730, 25529, 25366, 19576, 18770, 18739, 19492, 19200, 18600, 18140, 17758, 18556, 18546, 18044, 16261, 15801, 14776, 15703, 14114, 14641, 14010, 13894, 13895, 13877, 13567, 13893, 13634, 13681, 6442","repeated_count":"49","date":"09/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
