Steve King (R-Iowa) to prove this point. An ICE spokesperson told the Fact Checker, \"Illegal immigrants we arrested last year were responsible for the deaths of at least 1,000 people,\" in FY 2018, but was not able to provide more detailed data. This claim also lacks context. Research shows immigrants are less likely to engage in criminal behavior than the native-born population. There almost 50 murders a day in the US, or 300,000 since 2000, so even \"thousands\" would be a relatively small percentage of that total.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
