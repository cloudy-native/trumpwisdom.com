To be abused and treated so badly by the media, and to still hold her head so high, is truly wonderful!”","analysis":"Trump exaggerates by saying that Ivanka Trump was \"abused and treated so badly by the media.\" His tweet was referring to news coverage about Nordstrom dropping her brand. There was no evidence that Nordstrom acted out of political considerations, or that news coverage attacked Ivanka Trump over the news. The company has maintained for months (including in internal emails) that it will base its decisions on sales performance. Internal records reviewed by the Wall Street Journal show the sales of Ivanka Trump's brand fell 32 percent at Nordstrom last fiscal year.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/11/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
