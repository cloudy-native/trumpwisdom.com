Thousands and thousands of judges they want to hire. Who are these people? When we vet a single federal judge, it goes through a big process. Everybody that's ever met her or him -- they come, they complain, they don't complain. They say he's brilliant; she's brilliant; he's not smart enough to be a judge. Now we're hiring thousands and thousands. What country does this? … No, what -- seriously, what country does it? They said, 'Sir, we'd like to hire about five or six-thousand more judges.' Five or six-thousand? Now, can you imagine the graft that must take place?”","analysis":"The U.S. has about 350 immigration judges, and funding has been authorized for another 100 or so. There's no evidence that anyone has asked Trump to hire 5,000 or 6,000 judges. One bill by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) would add around 700. The president also says no other country in the world has judges hearing immigration cases. That's misleading. Plenty of countries have independent officials in the executive branch deciding who is and isn’t a refugee or an asylee. And in many of those countries, the courts are a last resort for these claims.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/19/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
