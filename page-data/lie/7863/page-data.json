But the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself has called the 2006 fence a \"nothing wall.\" In 2013, the deal in the works was \"comprehensive immigration reform.\" It included a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants and tougher border security measures, including fencing, but not anything like Trump's wall.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31482, 24398, 20407, 16846, 16087, 14949, 15579, 14266, 14609, 13946, 13862, 13709, 12022, 11920, 11784, 9587, 9239, 8643, 8479, 8483, 8282, 7811, 8013, 8095, 8104, 7771, 8090, 8221, 7863, 7699, 7685, 7594, 7431, 7536, 7446","repeated_count":"35","date":"12/31/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
