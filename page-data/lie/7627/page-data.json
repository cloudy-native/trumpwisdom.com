The Trump administration systematically separated all families who were caught crossing the border. This is worlds apart from the Obama- and Bush-era policy of separating children from adults at the border only in limited circumstances, such as when officials suspected human trafficking or another kind of danger to the child, or when false claims of parentage were made.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26975, 20055, 12519, 11691, 11985, 11942, 11434, 11895, 11260, 11825, 11847, 11848, 11849, 10300, 9859, 7627, 7410, 7220, 7086, 5550, 5958, 6104, 4759, 4774, 3502","repeated_count":"25","date":"12/16/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
