This guy lied about his service. He didn't just say, ‘Gee, I was in the service.’ No. He said, ‘I was in the Marines. Da Nang Province. Soldiers dying left and right as we battled up the hill.’ This went on for 15 years when he was the attorney general of Connecticut. I thought he was a great war hero. And then it turned out he was never in Vietnam.”","analysis":"Blumenthal on a few occasions before his first Senate race in 2010 said or implied he had served in Vietnam, when he had only served in the Marine reserves in the United States. But Trump seems to have fabricated a bunch of anecdotes and statements that Blumenthal never uttered. It was not 15 years, Blumenthal never described himself as a war hero and never talked about any battles or soldiers dying or battling up hills.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"25635, 25788, 25790, 7551, 6877, 6955, 5428, 5342, 5318, 5319, 5799, 5800, 5801, 5187, 5199, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5790","repeated_count":"19","date":"10/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
