That’s a very delicate one. It’s also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.” At that time, Trump was telling the nation that the virus was no worse than a seasonal flu, predicting it would soon disappear and insisting that the U.S. government had it totally under control. It would be several weeks before he would publicly acknowledge that the virus was no ordinary flu and that it could be transmitted through the air. It was not until a month later, in a subsequent interview in March, that Trump told Woodward he falsely minimized the coronavirus's risks because he wanted to maintain calm.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"23885","repeated_count":"1","date":"09/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
