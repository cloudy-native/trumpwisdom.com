Tremendous numbers. You saw the canvassers, they refused to sign their document because they said, 'We can't sign a fraudulent document, horrible things went on.' That's in Wayne County, Detroit.”","analysis":"Michigan, which Biden won by 155,000 votes, did not refuse to certify the votes. There was a brief delay in the certification by Wayne County, but then certification moved forward. Two Republicans on the Wayne County Board of Canvassers signed affidavits saying they were bullied into voting to certify election results and are seeking to revoke their certification, but the deadline for such action had passed. The county, which encompasses Detroit and has more than 1.7 million residents, saw Biden beat Trump by more than a 2-1 margin.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
