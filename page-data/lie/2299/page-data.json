In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford.”","analysis":"Trump presents these two cases as evidence that the diversity visa program and chain migration open the door to terrorist attacks. But two immigration cases out of thousands a year is not statistically significant. Moreover, it is false to claim, as Trump often does, that terror suspect Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov brought 22 relatives into the United States through \"chain migration\" or the diversity visa lottery. No agency has confirmed this figure and experts say it is implausible because Saipov only had a green card, meaning he could only bring in his wife (already in the U.S.) or his minor children (already U.S. citizens).
