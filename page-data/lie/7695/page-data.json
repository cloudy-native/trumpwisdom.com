Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim!”","analysis":"Trump issued this tweet just hours after a federal judge ordered North Korea to pay the parents of Otto Warmbier more than $500 million; Warmbier was arrested while traveling in North Korea and only released when he was near death, in a comatose state after 17 months in captivity. While Trump claimed \"progress being made\" on the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons, actually little progress has been made since Trump's summit with the North Korean dictator in June. The document signed by Trump and Kim was remarkably vague, leaving it open to interpretation and debate, compared to previous documents signed by North Korea. The statement said North Korea (officially the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or DPRK) committed to “work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” The phrase is not defined and “toward” is rather weak. In the past, North Korea viewed “denuclearization” to mean the United States removing the nuclear umbrella it provides to Japan and South Korea; there is no indication its definition has changed. In fact, North Korea <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/north-korea-rejects-denuclearization-unless-us-nuclear-threat-is-eliminated/2018/12/20/fcf642a2-0438-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html?utm_term=.e309fb55ad14\">reiterated this position</a> in a blistering statement just four days before this tweet.
