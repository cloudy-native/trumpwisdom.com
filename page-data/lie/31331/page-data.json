Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400,000 people. It was increased, nobody knows where it came from, by 400,000 ballots, one day after the election. It remains totally unexplained and said, well, we can't figure that. Now, that's many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that one element. Four hundred thousand ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election. By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn't know because it was so quick.”","analysis":"The source of this claim is obscure but it appears to have little basis in fact. In any case, it does not demonstrate election fraud.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/06/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
