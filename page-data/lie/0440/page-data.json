They used to call this 'judge shopping!' Messy system.”","analysis":"San Francisco and Santa Clara County, the governments that sued over Trump's sanctuary order, are in California. So that's where they would need to file a lawsuit. They also did not get to choose the judge that ruled against Trump. We have earlier explored the claim about the Ninth Circuit being overturned 80 percent. The Ninth Circuit is not the most overturned court by the annual reversal rate. It does have a high raw number of reversals or number of cases on the Supreme Court docket. But it also reviews more cases than other circuits, is larger than other circuits and terminates far more cases than other circuits.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"2786, 0449","repeated_count":"2","date":"04/26/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
