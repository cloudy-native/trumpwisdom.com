Not only moving it; I also built it. We got it done. We got that done. And we got that built for a little less. They thought it was going to take a billion. I got it built for $490,000. And they said, \"How do you do that?\" Well, we had a better location. Norm knows that. ... He said, \"Sir, we actually have a building that's in a much better location. Why don't we renovate it and make that the embassy?\" We did it in about four months. And instead of spending $1.1 billion, we spent less than $500,000.”","analysis":"The new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem for about $400,000. (Trump sometimes claims it cost $500,000.)
