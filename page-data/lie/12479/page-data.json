It is nothing more than an evil propaganda machine for the Democrat Party. The reporting is so false, biased and evil that it has now become a very sick joke...But the public is aware! #CROOKEDJOURNALISM”","analysis":"When Trump doesn't like what's being reported, he calls it fake news. But in almost every case, the reports are proven to be accurate and the substance of Trump's complaint is that the facts reflect poorly on him. Reputable news organizations follow ethical rules and correct mistakes promptly, something Trump knows since he often celebrates these corrections on Twitter. These overheated comments are not based in facts.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
