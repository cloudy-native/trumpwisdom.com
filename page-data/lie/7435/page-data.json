In the end, it was undeniable that Democrats rode a blue wave to claim the House majority by winning a net 40 seats. His numbers were off at the time he made these comments, too. He had campaigned for 13 candidates in the last week before the election, eight of whom had won.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
