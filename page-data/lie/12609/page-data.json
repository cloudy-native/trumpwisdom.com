You have drug dealers that get not even 30 days, and they've killed 25 people.”","analysis":"Once again, the president ends up in Four-Pinocchio territory because of the way he frames his rhetoric. He may have a point that “kingpin” drug dealers are responsible for at least hundreds of deaths. But then he cannot turn around and say they only end up with 30 or so days in prison if they are caught. A handful of drug dealers might get by with a little prison time, but those are the small fry, not the people responsible for many deaths.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"12609, 2916, 2920, 2919, 2917, 2918","repeated_count":"6","date":"08/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
