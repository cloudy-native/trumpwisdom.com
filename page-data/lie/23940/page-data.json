And then you read these fake reporters and they say, uh, President Trump is tied in Nevada tied. I don't think so. The only way we're tied is if they screw around with the ballots, which they will do in my opinion, OK?”","analysis":"They were never tied and Trump ended up losing Nevada to Joe Biden. Reporters accurately noted during the campaign that Biden <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/nevada/\">was ahead</a> in the polls. Trump offers no evidence for his \"opinion\" that Nevada's election would be rigged, and couching it as an opinion doesn't make it any less dependent on a false premise. \"Thousands of people on the streets\" is an exaggeration. News reports and social media posts from reporters on the ground show there dozens at most.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
