That is, never forget, the crime.”","analysis":"There’s a lot wrapped into one single tweet. First of all, the special counsel revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The special counsel concluded Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons associated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. Eleven out of 16 attorneys on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team made public so far have contributed to Democrats, including Clinton and Obama. The other five have no record of political contributions, though the Daily Caller says 13 are registered Democrats. One attorney who donated the maximum amount represented the Clinton Foundation in a 2015 lawsuit. Another attorney without a record of political donations represented a Clinton aide at one point. Both attorneys worked for WilmerHale, a firm that also represents Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, as well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Moreover, under federal law, Mueller is not allowed to consider the political leanings of his staff when hiring them.  As for the spying that Trump mentions, it has been reported that an FBI informant in Europe, a professor named Stefan Halper, met with at least three people working on the Trump campaign in Europe. So far, there has been nothing to indicate whether there was a political agenda or a “spy” mandate as part of Halper's assistance for the FBI, which started after the agency opened a counterintelligence probe. The FISA surveillance warrant on Carter Page, a one time campaign aide to Trump, was issued after Page had left the campaign.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"29797, 30459, 28072, 25594, 24537, 23434, 20513, 17112, 17187, 16091, 16463, 16006, 15481, 14358, 14415, 13759, 13842, 13611, 12957, 13677, 12149, 12039, 12029, 11944, 11863, 11169, 11189, 11774, 11116, 11095, 10915, 10746, 10728, 10717, 10437, 10958, 10960, 10537, 10541, 10542, 10932, 10129, 10283, 9953, 10146, 10149, 10114, 9764, 10021, 10073, 9917, 9824, 9738, 9740, 9346, 9085, 8702, 8050, 7582, 7583, 7584, 7269, 7266, 6580, 6535, 7516, 7211, 7213, 6999, 7452, 5056, 5057, 5040, 5969, 4818, 4756, 4497, 4357, 4406, 4479, 4383, 4469, 4274, 4532, 3611, 3628, 3647, 3388, 3421, 3920, 3930, 3289, 3291, 3241, 3242, 3180, 3248, 3062, 3041, 2944, 2614, 0723","repeated_count":"102","date":"04/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
