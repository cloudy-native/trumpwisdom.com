But that is in part because there's an expectation that Germany may fall into a recession. As the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.apnews.com/ba54214acc644729947c98f4539afc05\">AP reported</a>: “The negative interest rates on German bonds also reflect that government’s aversion to issuing debt, even though the borrowing would allow it to spend more on roads and bridges to spur stronger economic growth. By having even slightly positive interest rates compared to the rest of the world, the United States is in a better position to attract global investment.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"19329, 17835, 14242, 14237, 12797, 12801, 13007, 12648, 13288, 12610, 12505, 12560, 12584","repeated_count":"13","date":"10/24/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
