I want to thank Mexico for what they've been doing. You look at the numbers; they're tumbling down. This is one on catch and release. Look at that. See that, fellas? Catch and -- would you say that's pretty good? I'd say it's pretty good. I'd say it's pretty amazing, Steve, even for your -- from your standpoint, Steve, fellas. That's some number, huh? Getting down to almost zero. Look. So it was not doing so good for a long time. Catch and release. We had no help from the Do-Nothing Democrats, so we did it with Mexico.”","analysis":"The claim that Mexico only just started to detain thousands of Central Americans at its southern border is nonsense. Mexican immigration officials had 886,640 encounters with Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans from 2011 through February, according to data from Mexico’s Department of the Interior (SEGOB). Fifty-three percent (472,249) happened at the four Mexican states that border Central America: Campeche, Chiapas, Quintana Roo and Tabasco. The statistics also show that from 2001 through February, Mexico recorded 2.15 million deportations of people from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, the three countries in the Northern Triangle driving the Central American migration phenomenon.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"13539, 11205, 10955, 10880, 9909, 9893, 9728, 9757, 9763, 9777, 9810, 9817, 9725","repeated_count":"13","date":"10/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
