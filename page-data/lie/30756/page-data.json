A Reuters poll <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-poll/half-of-republicans-say-biden-won-because-of-a-rigged-election-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN27Y1AJ\">found</a> about half of all Republicans believe President Donald Trump “rightfully won” the U.S. election but that it was stolen from him by widespread voter fraud.  The poll also said 68% of Republicans said they were concerned that the election was “rigged,” while only 16% of Democrats and one-third of independents were similarly worried. We can find no evidence to support Trump's claim that as much as 40 percent of Democrats thought the election was fraudulent.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
