Nobody has ever made such a call before. I said, 'That's because they were was stupid.'”","analysis":"Not only is this call likely a flight of fancy, but the United States provides virtually no subsidies to the Saudi military. \"U.S. training and security support to Saudi Arabia remains overwhelmingly Saudi funded via Foreign Military Sales and other contracts, reflecting Saudi ability to pay for costly programs (and limiting opportunities for Congress to affect cooperation through appropriations legislation),\" says a report from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33533.pdf#page=23\">the Congressional Research Service</a>. \"Saudi Arabia receives roughly $10,000 per year in International Military Education and Training (IMET) assistance authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. This nominal amount makes Saudi Arabia eligible for a discount on training that it purchases through the Foreign Military Sales program.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
