And many of them scattered, and it was pretty much a failure. I mean, to me that’s obstruction of justice, and something should happen there. And it hasn’t, and I don’t know why it hasn’t.”","analysis":"Trump blames the mayor of Oakland, Calif., for spoiling a four-day immigration sweep in Northern California. The mayor, Libby Schaaf, had warned residents about the raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement the night before it began in February. The suggestion that Schaaf allowed 1,000 people to evade ICE is misleading because the agency never captures all its targets in such raids, according to a former ICE spokesman in California who resigned in protest after this raid. ICE ended up arresting 232 unauthorized immigrants during this raid that Trump calls “pretty much a failure.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
