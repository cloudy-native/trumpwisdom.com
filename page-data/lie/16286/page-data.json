You know that, right? ... Thirty-two percent of our car business moved to Mexico.”","analysis":"It’s unclear where Trump gets this 32 percent estimate. Millions of manufacturing jobs and thousands of U.S. factories have disappeared since NAFTA took effect in 1994, but it’s difficult to isolate how many were relocated to Mexico or how much was because of NAFTA. Studies we reviewed indicate NAFTA had a modest effect on the U.S. economy. Auto industry representatives and independent analysts seem to agree the NAFTA dynamics have helped rather than hindered automakers with U.S. operations. Mexico was a relatively small player in North American vehicle production before NAFTA, producing only 3 percent of the continent’s vehicles in 1987, and it now makes about 20 percent of light vehicles. The U.S. share of North American vehicle production was 70 percent in 2007 and is projected to be about 60 percent in 2020, according to a 2016 report by the Center for Automotive Research.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29741, 29083, 28725, 27468, 22454, 21443, 19732, 19690, 18254, 16429, 16286, 12627, 12410, 12321, 11426, 11320, 12180, 11941, 11753, 11083, 11712, 10914, 10794, 10707, 10883, 9815, 9538, 8789","repeated_count":"28","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
