He’s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of...........agencies, not just the FBI & DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election. Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don’t believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).” Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews","analysis":"Several investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election are ongoing, so there has been no determination either way that implicates or vindicates Trump. And there's no evidence that the Obama administration had a concerted effort to dig up dirt on Trump during the 2016 race.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/10/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
