I called up OPEC. I said, 'You got to bring them down. You got to bring them down.\"'And gasoline is coming down.”","analysis":"The president has little power to move prices at the gas pump in any direction because they depend on market forces beyond his control. A variety of market factors has contributed to the falling price of gasoline, including Trump's announcement of new sanctions on Iran to choke off its oil sales. Trump previously claimed prices fell because of phone calls to foreign leaders in oil-rich countries. But according to the authoritative <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cspdailynews.com/fuels/2019-gasoline-price-surge\">Lundberg Survey of U.S. fuel markets</a>, the national average regular-grade pump price climbed 12.69 cents per gallon (CPG) to $2.9118. Over four weeks, it is up nearly 25 cents. Over four months, there has been a surge of more than 60 cents. Among the factors: \"The topmost price-increase contributor now is repairs and maintenance at many U.S. refineries, including several unplanned projects.
