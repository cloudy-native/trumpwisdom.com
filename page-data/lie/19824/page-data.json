As for \"greatest weapons,\" we believe Trump is referring to what he once called a \"super-duper\" weapon. These are hypersonic weapons, namely hypersonic glide vehicles (HGV) that can reach speeds of at least Mach 5, or roughly 3,800 mph. Trump has previously called these the fastest missiles ever made but that's wrong. They are not faster than US nuclear-armed intercontinental-range ballistic missiles.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
