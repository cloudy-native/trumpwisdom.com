These are people who have been approved by committees and all others, yet Schumer continues to hold them back from serving their Country! Very Unfair!”","analysis":"This is nonsense for several reasons. Republicans control the Senate and could confirm any pending nominee with a simple majority. In other words, Trump's pending nominees could be confirmed without Democratic votes. Democrats have tools to delay the process, but they cannot block it, and Trump has been slow to name people to many posts. It's also doubtful that 360 people are awaiting confirmation. As of Dec. 23, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-administration-appointee-tracker/database/?utm_term=.4392c603477d\">The Washington Post tracker of 707 key administration positions</a> showed 380 people had been confirmed, 195 were awaiting confirmation, nine were announced but had not been formally nominated and 126 positions still had no nominee.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"11755, 8760, 8752, 7872, 7843, 7865","repeated_count":"6","date":"12/31/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
