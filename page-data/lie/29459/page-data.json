You know that. You know that better than anybody. There had been new, no new plants had been built in Michigan in decades and decades before I got here.”","analysis":"This is utterly false. Trump often limits this claim just to Michigan, but also sometimes suggests there were no new auto plants built in the United States for 42 years. Prior to 2017, when Trump took office, just in Michigan General Motors built a light vehicle assembly plant in Lansing Delta Township, completed in 2006. It’s “GM’s newest plant in the United States,” <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/company_info/facilities/assembly/ldt.html\">the company’s website says</a>. Despite Trump's constant bragging of new auto-plant investments from overseas, during his presidency, only two foreign manufacturers -- Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, an Italian-American multinational, and Toyota, a Japanese company, in a joint venture with Mazda -- announced plans to build major production facilities. (A French company also announced plans for a plant that would create 50 jobs.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"30223, 30443, 29459, 29649, 29081, 28723, 28035, 26664, 27420, 26903, 27222, 27535, 25423, 25895, 22450, 21061","repeated_count":"16","date":"11/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
