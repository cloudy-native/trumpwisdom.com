A 2013 Senate report found that the U.S. spent $10 billion a year on bases abroad, with 70 percent focused on three countries - Germany, South Korea and Japan. Germany is the center of European defense obligations, while the troops in Japan are the core of U.S. projection of power in Asia. The troops in Korea deter an attack by North Korea. Given a defense budget of about $700 billion, the cost of maintaining these bases is a mere pittance.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/09/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
