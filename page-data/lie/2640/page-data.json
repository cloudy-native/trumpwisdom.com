They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws.....”","analysis":"Contrary to Trump’s tweet, there is nothing illegal about seeking asylum; it would be up to U.S. authorities to decide whether the migrants qualify for asylum. Obviously, if the migrants attempted to cross the border without authorization, that would be illegal, and they could be deported. Mexican authorities have rejected Trump’s complaints that they have not acted against migrants. Mexican authorities say they apprehended more than 82,000 Central Americans in 2017, according to the Los Angeles Times, which says that between October 2014 and May 2015, Mexico detained more Central American migrants than the U.S. Border Patrol.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
