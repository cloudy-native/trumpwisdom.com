The Trump administration went outside normal channels to withhold security aid for Ukraine and Trump also dangled a prospective meeting between himself and the Ukrainian president while he pressed for the investigation of Biden, a potential Democratic opponent in the 2020 election. The White House readout of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lays out that Trump was offering to meet with Zelensky at the same time he was asking for the Biden probe. In addition, a quid pro quo could have been implicit and still be a weighty matter for investigators to probe.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/29/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
