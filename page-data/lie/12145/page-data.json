Trump’s $91 billion figure includes $50 billion in additional estimated liabilities that could emerge over the next 20 years, but that’s a figure subject to change. Trump sometimes suggests that the money has already been received but that’s simply wrong. By the end of fiscal year 2019, the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates, Puerto Rico will have received about $21 billion. While Trump often says this is an all-time record, Congress spent $120 billion on Hurricane Katrina, spread across three states.
