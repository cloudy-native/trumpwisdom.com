The lowest monthly unemployment rate recorded since World War II is 2.5 percent in 1953; the lowest annual unemployment rate is 2.9 percent in 1953. Two days after Trump spoke, the unemployment rate in December rose to 3.9 percent. That resulted in an annual unemployment rate of 3.9 percent for all of 2018 -- a full percentage point higher than 1953.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"22155, 22176, 17022, 17255, 16713, 16111, 16175, 15868, 14960, 14136, 13521, 13579, 13071, 13041, 13152, 13205, 13504, 13192, 13202, 13638, 13655, 13173, 12590, 11362, 11376, 11698, 11258, 11151, 11225, 11221, 11049, 10860, 10185, 10205, 10089, 10110, 10000, 9907, 9938, 9870, 9802, 9513, 9357, 9310, 9256, 9103, 8108, 7923, 7346, 7376, 7015, 6923, 6987, 7140, 6845, 6924, 6927, 6925, 6926, 6928, 6929, 6930, 6931, 6988, 6990, 6989, 6991, 6993, 6992, 6994, 6995, 6996","repeated_count":"72","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
