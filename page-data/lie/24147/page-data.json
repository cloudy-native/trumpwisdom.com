We consider ourself a forest nation.’ This was in Europe. I said, ‘That's a beautiful term.’ He said, ‘We have trees that are far more explosive‘ -- he meant explosive in terms of fire – ‘but we have trees that are more explosive they have in California, and we don't have any problem because we manage our forests.’ So we have to do that in California, too.”","analysis":"Trump often repeats an unscientific claim that pile ups of leaves and fallen tree trunks are a root cause of the massive wildfires in northern and central California, where officials say hundreds of thousands of acres have burned. Academic researchers, firefighters, California state officials and the prime minister of Finland have all been befuddled by Trump’s claim. (Trump once claimed the Finnish leader told him that assiduous raking was the secret to unburnt forests, but then word came back from Helsinki that the prime minister never said that.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
