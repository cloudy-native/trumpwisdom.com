It was much cheaper, and it had much better light. And you're all good-looking people, but you look better under the old lightbulb than that horrible, new lightbulb. Right? It cost you a fraction of the cost. Didn't last as long, but that's okay. But it cost you a fraction. I reinstituted and opened it up so they can sell both. They can sell the new one if you want it, and they can sell the old one. The old one is doing unbe- -- amazing business. Amazing business. And, you know, the new one is considered 'hazardous waste.' When you lose it, you're supposed to take it down to a -- a dump, a specified dump. How many people are going to do that with a light bulb? 'Hey, you know, we lost this lightbulb. Let's travel 28 miles outside of the city to get rid of it.'”","analysis":"Trump is trying to justify the weakening of rules to promote the extension of light bulb energy-efficiency standards. He appears to be talking about compact fluorescent, or CFL, bulbs, which contain mercury and tend to have harsher color quality. But he's out of date. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nema.org/Intelligence/Indices/Pages/LED-A-line-Halogen-and-CFL-Lamp-Shipments-Decrease-in-First-Quarter-2019-Compared-to-First-Quarter-2018.aspx\">says</a> that in 2019 CFLs accounted for less than 5 percent of all sales of the classic pear-shaped bulbs. Light-emitting diode, or LED, bulbs are the dominant environmentally friendly technology. They don't have safety risks and often provide comparable light at a cheaper lifetime cost than incandescents. LEDs currently made up more than 70 percent of sales.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"21307, 21182, 16330, 13543, 13733, 12758, 12708","repeated_count":"7","date":"08/06/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
