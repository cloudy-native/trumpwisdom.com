Not going to happen in the U.S.”","analysis":"Many Central American children who are sent with smugglers or coyotes or people who are not their parents are fleeing extreme violence and have legitimate asylum claims. But children don’t help adults (criminal or not) enter the country. Under current law, children receive safe harbor if they are thought to be trafficking victims and are “exempt from prompt return to their home country.” And any adult claiming to be a relative has to prove that claim through a rigorous screening process. The Department of Homeland Security itself notes that it has regularly separated children from adults who are not relatives.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/18/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
