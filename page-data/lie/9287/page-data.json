It is about Border Security and the Wall (stopping Crime, Drugs etc.), not Constitutionality and Precedent. It is an 80% positive issue. The Dems are 100% United, as usual, on a 20% issue, Open Borders and Crime. Get tough R’s!”","analysis":"It's a real legal question whether Trump can circumvent Congress's power under the Constitution to approve or reject spending by declaring a national emergency to fund his promised border wall. Trump says 80 percent of people support his border wall proposal. But the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2019/03/spinning-popular-support-for-emergency-declaration/?platform=hootsuite\">poll</a> he is referring to actually asked whether respondents favored \"basically open borders\" or \"secure borders.\" Seventy-nine percent of respondents said they favored secure borders. Many Democrats hold the same position. But a continuous wall along the border is a much different and more specific proposition that does not enjoy wide support, according to multiple surveys. Trump routinely argues that immigrants bring more crime, but researchers have found continually that legal and unauthorized immigrants commit crime at lower rates than the native-born population. Most heroin smuggled through the border is taken through legal ports of entry, which would continue to exist if a wall were built. It's also well known that drug cartels and others dig tunnels into the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
