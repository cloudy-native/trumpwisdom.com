White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that Trump was talking about an investigation in Wisconsin. Some lost mail in Wisconsin <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-claimed-ballots-dumped-river-reality/story?id=73370587\">was found</a> on the side of a road and in a ditch line in Greenville, Wisconsin, a small town of about 12,000 people outside the city of Appleton. The mail was supposed to be in transit to the post office, according to the Outagamie County Sheriff's office. \"Several\" absentee ballots were found among three \"trays\" of mail, according to the sheriff's office.
