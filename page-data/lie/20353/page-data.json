Trump was losing to Biden in this national survey, but the president was ahead when looking only at certain battleground states, 52 percent to 45 percent. CNN polled \"a total of 1,112 adults, including an oversample of 302 adults living in 15 battleground states.\" So the sample of respondents was much larger for the result showing Biden ahead nationally, whereas the battleground results relied on an average of 20 respondents per state.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
