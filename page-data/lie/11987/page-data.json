President Obama wanted to meet with Kim Jong Un. And Kim Jong Un said no. Numerous occasions he called. …  During President Obama, they were nuclear testing. They were sending missiles. Right now, everything is nice and quiet.”","analysis":"No public records or news articles show that Obama ever tried to meet with Kim. Former U.S. intelligence officials and experts on North Korea said they knew of no evidence for Trump’s claim. Many of Obama’s top advisers on North Korea said Trump’s claim was false. Obama’s strategy after 2012 was to escalate sanctions and avoid entreaties to North Korea. He very clearly told the world he was not interested in a meeting. North Korea continues to test short-range missiles.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/05/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
