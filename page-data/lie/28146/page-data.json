He called me George, and then I hear the reporter sort of said, \"No. No. No. It's not George, Donald.”","analysis":"Trump is referencing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/no-biden-did-not-confuse-george-w-bush-and-donald-trump/2020/10/26/54422ff5-b3e5-48a7-8c72-4ce641f977d2_video.html\">a misleading video clip</a> that Republican National Committee rapid response director Steve Guest tweeted out: Just 27 seconds long, it appeared to show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden criticize former president George W. Bush as the person he is running against — not President Trump. As tweeted by Guest, the snippet from Biden’s Oct. 25 “I Will Vote” concert seemed to be evidence of a nasty theory the Trump campaign has been pushing for months: Joe Biden is senile. But Guest started the clip when the moderators were no longer on the screen, and thus he eliminated key context by removing the most obvious George that Biden could be referring to — moderator George Lopez — and filled in the gap with an answer better suited to the Trump campaign’s unproven narrative of Biden’s faltering mental acuity. Contrary to speculation by the Trump campaign, there also is no evidence of Jill Biden mouthing anything while Biden is speaking, unless you have an overactive imagination. She is pursing her lips in the clip. We gave Guest Four Pinocchios yet Trump continued to advance this false claim on Twitter and in his campaign rallies.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"28522, 28369, 28496, 27586, 28099, 28146","repeated_count":"6","date":"10/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
