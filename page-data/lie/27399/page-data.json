I said, I'm sorry, Doctor, you're a wonderful man –and I – he is a nice man. You're a wonderful man, I'm closing it. I saved thousands of lives, he admitted that two months later, two months later. And Dr. Fauci said, don't put on masks, don't put – you see the thing? And now, he says put on masks. And they say, he's a wonderful guy. And he is a wonderful guy, I like him. He just happens to have a very bad arm.”","analysis":"Trump has three basic complaints about Anthony S. Fauci, the renowned director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But they are bogus. 1) Fauci never said anything like “This will pass.” He spoke as a scientist, evaluating the data in front of him. From the start, he warned of the need to be vigilant. 2) While Fauci did initially express public skepticism about the effectiveness of travel restrictions, by the time of the announcement, Fauci was a supporter of the idea. “These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS,” Health Secretary Alex Azar said shortly after the announcement. 3) As for wearing a mask, Fauci has explained he was motivated by early fears that N95 masks needed by hospital workers would quickly run out of stock. Once science indicated that the virus was spread by people who were asymptomatic, the guidance was updated, because even fabric masks can help halt the spread if everyone wears them.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"29424, 30071, 26942, 27030, 26747, 26718, 26900, 27256, 27399, 26375, 26180, 26307, 26023, 24880, 24801, 24556, 24333, 24211, 23333, 23495, 23130, 23017, 21286, 21716, 20834, 21613, 21082, 21160, 21163, 20870","repeated_count":"30","date":"10/19/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
