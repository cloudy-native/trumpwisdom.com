And the Democrats didn't want to do it. They just didn't want to do it, Doug, no matter what. It didn't matter. And these are people that voted in favor of it 10 years ago, but they never got it built because they didn't know how to build it -- because building it is tough, too. But I do that, and we know how to build.”","analysis":"Sen. Charles Schumer and many Democrats (though not Rep. Nancy Pelosi) voted for the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was signed by President George W. Bush and authorized building a fence along nearly 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. It passed 283-138 in the House, with 64 Democrat votes, and 80-19 in the Senate, with 26 Democrat votes. But the fence they voted for is not as substantial as the wall Trump is proposing. Trump himself has called the 2006 fence a “nothing wall.” \n\nTo Trump, opposing the wall is tantamount to not wanting any border security at all. But Democrats have offered support for $1.67 billion in security enhancements. That doesn't include funding for Trump’s wall, but it includes 65 miles of pedestrian fencing along the Southeast Texas border with Mexico, similar to what already exists.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31482, 24398, 20407, 16846, 16087, 14949, 15579, 14266, 14609, 13946, 13862, 13709, 12022, 11920, 11784, 9587, 9239, 8643, 8479, 8483, 8282, 7811, 8013, 8095, 8104, 7771, 8090, 8221, 7863, 7699, 7685, 7594, 7431, 7536, 7446","repeated_count":"35","date":"06/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
