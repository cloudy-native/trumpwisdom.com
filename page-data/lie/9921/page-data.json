Oakland welcomes all people. My job as a mayor is to welcome people. I don't build walls. It's our job to welcome everyone into our city, ensure their safety, ensure that their families can thrive. And that is my job no matter where those people came from or how they got there.\" She added: \"We know that data proves that undocumented or documented immigrants commit far fewer crimes. So not only is our community richer and more loving. But it also is safer because we are a sanctuary city and a diverse city.\"\n\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/13/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
