You know, I used to mention only Arizona because they were up 116 percent in Arizona. Now Arizona is like good by comparison to some of the numbers. But they’re way up in Arizona, also.”","analysis":"Trump cherry-picks the high end of premium increases by selecting Alaska’s 203 percent increase, even though the average monthly premium across the country was up about 25 percent before subsidies. Trump also uses the calculation of premium increases without incorporating the impact of tax credits — which most people in the exchanges receive. If you take the subsidies into account, the average monthly premium of most people in the individual market exchange goes down, not up. Finally, it’s an apples-to-oranges comparison by using figures from 2013 — before most major provisions of Obamacare had taken effect — and comparing them to ones from 2017.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"6005, 5138, 1440, 1468, 1229, 1230, 1231, 1216, 1078, 0901, 0788, 0738, 0732, 0708, 0707, 0252","repeated_count":"16","date":"06/13/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
