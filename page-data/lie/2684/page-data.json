E-commerce deliveries are one of the post office’s few thriving and growing lines of business. The online retail giant clearly leverages many tools to keep the taxman at bay. That doesn’t erase its state and local tax bills, which are larger than Trump allows.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"24491, 22053, 21204, 21537, 21552, 21563, 22443, 22489, 22558, 21894, 21295, 19554, 18660, 7010, 2684, 2840, 2644, 2638, 2635","repeated_count":"19","date":"04/03/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
