In reality, President Obama set in motion the process that led to the successful SpaceX launch with astronauts. He decided to send crews via commercial spacecraft in 2011, an initiative that encountered fierce opposition from Congress, which at first did not provide as much money as NASA sought. Trump sometimes offers an image of a NASA space center with grass growing on the tarmac and in shambles, but that's false.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30651, 29848, 29255, 29555, 29724, 28489, 29004, 27906, 27742, 28250, 27174, 27487, 26466, 26132, 25572, 25477, 25446, 25275, 26592, 25931, 24947, 24870, 24700, 24574, 24462, 24112, 23707, 23518, 22080, 22870, 19809, 19813, 9170, 4043, 3541, 3279","repeated_count":"36","date":"09/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
