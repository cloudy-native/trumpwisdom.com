In other words, because he's here -- so a whole group of people come in....Think of it: This man that killed 8 people and so badly injured 12, they say he's about 22 relatives coming in that are here.

It's not a good picture.”","analysis":"Trump says terror suspect Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov brought 22 relatives into the United States through \"chain migration\" or the diversity visa lottery. But no agency has confirmed this figure and experts say it is implausible because Saipov only had a green card. That means he could only bring in his wife (already in the U.S.) or his minor children (already U.S. citizens).
