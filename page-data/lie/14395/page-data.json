No, no. Even if you don't like me; some of you don’t. Some of you I don't like at all, actually.

Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax would not take away 100 percent of a person's wealth. Warren's \"Ultra-Millionaire Tax\" would apply to households with a net worth of $50 million or more, essentially the wealthiest 75,000 households. They would be charged 2 percent of every dollar of net worth above $50 million - unless they were billionaires. Households with $1 billion or more in assets would start paying 3 percent on assets above $1 billion.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
