And now he made it a lie when he said he never spoke to his son. I mean, give me a break, he's already said he spoke to his son. And now he said, yesterday, very firmly. Who wouldn't speak to your son? Of course, you spoke to your son. So, he made the mistake of saying he never spoke to his son. He spoke to his son.”","analysis":"Biden told reporters that he never spoke to his son about his overseas business dealings. The New Yorker magazine, in a profile of Hunter Biden, recounted: \"As Hunter recalled, his father discussed Burisma with him just once: 'Dad said, \"I hope you know what you are doing,\" and I said, \"I do.\"' Is that a substantive discussion or not? We will leave it to readers to decide, but it’s a thin reed on which to hang the label of “lie.” In any case, Biden never said he spoke to his son, as Trump claimed he did.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/22/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
