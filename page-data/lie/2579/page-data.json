As deputy director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter.”\r\n\r\nDuring May 2017 testimony, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) asked Comey two key questions: “Director Comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?”\r\n\r\nComey replied: “Never.”\r\n\r\nThen Grassley asked: “Question two and relatively related: Have you ever authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports about the Trump investigation or the Clinton investigation?”\r\n\r\nComey replied: “No.”\r\n\r\nWhether Comey’s answer was untruthful may turn on the question of authorization. McCabe asserts that he had the authority to have the conversation with the reporter and that Comey was “aware of the interaction.” But he does not say Comey authorized the conversation — and Grassley did not ask whether Comey was aware of anyone in the FBI acting as an anonymous source.\r\n\r\nTrump jumped to the conclusion that Comey lied. (He also changed the question asked by Grassley from “authorized” to “known,” precisely what we noted Grassley did not ask.) Nevertheless, Comey’s emphatic responses may cause him trouble.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/17/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
