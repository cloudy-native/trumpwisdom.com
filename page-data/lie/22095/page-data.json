Biden does not support “defunding police,” according to the candidate and the campaign. The phrase generally means shrinking the scope of police responsibilities to public safety and changing the tactics used by police officers. Biden backs advocates’ calls to increase spending on social programs separate from local police budgets, but he also wants more funding for police reforms such as body cameras and training on community policing approaches.\n\n“No, I don't support defunding the police,” Biden told CBS. “I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness. And, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community.” Biden, in fact, has come under fire from the left for his position and for proposing to spend an additional $300 million a year on the community policing program started in the Clinton administration.\n\nTrump citation of “yes, absolutely” draws a quote from an interview Biden had with activist Ady Barkan — and an edited version posted by NowThis on July 8.\n\nDuring the interview, Barkan said, “We can reduce the responsibilities assigned to the police and redirect some of the funding for police into social services, mental health counseling and affordable housing.”\n\nHe asked Biden, “Are you open to that kind of reform?” In the video, Biden replies, “I've proposed that kind of reform.” At another point, Barkan again asks: “But so we agree that we can redirect some of the funding?” The video shows Biden saying: “Yes, absolutely.”\n\nBut the audiotape of the full conversation on police shows Biden’s responses were much more nuanced. The NowThis video does not include Biden adding that his response was not the same as “defunding all the police.” He also speaks about increasing funding for mental health, which is different from saying he would fund mental health aid out of redirected funds from the police. In effect, Biden says he would condition aid on police reforms as an incentive on the one hand, while simultaneously providing additional resources for mental health, homelessness and other kinds of community support.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"29509, 30002, 30098, 28703, 28429, 28527, 28372, 28777, 28825, 28147, 28304, 27596, 27811, 27656, 27771, 26784, 26620, 26702, 27066, 27407, 26934, 26866, 27232, 27437, 26365, 26496, 25539, 25516, 25607, 26028, 24846, 24634, 24132, 24052, 24058, 24120, 23901, 23983, 23506, 23200, 23177, 22095, 21985, 21933, 21002, 21009, 22431, 23022, 22988, 22930, 22193, 22776, 22837, 21786, 21238, 22714, 21617, 22603, 22620, 20787, 21194, 22580, 21113, 20839, 20713, 20780, 20581, 19859, 19861, 19852, 20762, 19848","repeated_count":"72","date":"08/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
