He publicly even stated that he said “don't go” until more intelligence was gathered. So it’s clear he advised Obama not to go at that moment when Obama’s advisers were debating the issue.\n\nBiden in an interview with CBS claimed he did not say “don't go” but instead had said, “Try one more thing.” He argued that since Obama had not made a final decision, he did not want to be on record in front of other administration officials as urging the mission. “We walked up to the Oval. I said: ‘Mister President, follow your instincts. I know you should do it, but follow your instincts.’ ”\n\nAntony Blinken, a former deputy secretary of state who in 2011 was Biden’s top foreign policy adviser, told The Fact Checker that he had learned of the private conversation between Obama and Biden shortly after it happened. Biden had argued in the Situation Room meeting for taking more time to get positive identification of bin Laden, but in the private conversation with Obama, Biden said, “Follow your instincts, they are always good,” according to Blinken’s recollection. (Blinken is a campaign adviser to Biden.)\n\nSo it appears that there was a second conversation between Obama and Biden, after the Situation Room meeting, in which he urged the president to follow his instincts. Whether Biden delivered a firm “go” message — or Obama heard one — remains unconfirmed.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
