It should be: You go to a booth and you proudly display yourself. You don't send it in the mail where people pick up -- all sorts of bad things can happen by the time they signed that, if they sign that -- if they signed that by the time it gets in and is tabulated.”","analysis":"Despite Trump's frequent assertions of voter fraud, electoral fraud of any form is very rare. In about two-thirds of states, voters can request a mail-in ballot without providing an excuse for not being able to vote in person on Election Day. Five states — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington and Utah — now conduct their elections almost entirely by mail, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx\">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>. At least 21 other states have laws that allow certain smaller elections, such as school board contests, to be conducted by mail, with three states -- California, Nebraska and North Dakota -- permitting counties to opt into conducting all elections by mail. Trump himself votes by absentee ballot in Florida.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
