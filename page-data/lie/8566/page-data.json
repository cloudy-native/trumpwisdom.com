A false narrative is so bad for our Country. I value our intelligence community. Happily, we had a very good meeting, and we are all on the same page!”","analysis":"Trump suggests that the news reports of a split between his views and the assessment of the intelligence agencies stemmed from incorrect reporting by the media. But that's wrong.
