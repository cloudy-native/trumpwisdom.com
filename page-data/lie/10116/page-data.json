You know they're great. All you have to do is go look at the records; they're all over the place. But they checked my financials and they checked my taxes, I assume.”","analysis":"There is no indication that special counsel Robert Mueller sought or looked at Trump's tax returns. Mueller is careful to break down direct and indirect costs from his investigation, {as we've reported}, and is far below what independent counsels spent investigating Clinton.\r\n\r\nMueller through September 2018 had reported $25.2 million in costs. Presumably, this figure will rise when the final costs are released. But Mueller also made money for the government, namely by seizing properties owned by former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Independent journalist Marcy Wheeler has estimated the value of Manafort’s seized assets at $46 million.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"30830, 30771, 29796, 29879, 30261, 30461, 29205, 28071, 28180, 26236, 25377, 25088, 24539, 23433, 22335, 21341, 22666, 21173, 20692, 20514, 19758, 16686, 16089, 16005, 14917, 14357, 14372, 14416, 14184, 13763, 12958, 13679, 13003, 11776, 11097, 10745, 10787, 10718, 10438, 10449, 10453, 10959, 10961, 10592, 10570, 10533, 10852, 10932, 10363, 10150, 9785, 10116, 9660","repeated_count":"53","date":"04/24/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
