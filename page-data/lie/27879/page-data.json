She's a very wealthy woman, retired. Gave him {hunter Biden]  3-1/2 million dollars.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to an allegation in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HSGAC_Finance_Report_FINAL.pdf\">a report</a> released by the GOP majority of the Senate Homeland Security Committee: “Rosemont Seneca Thornton, an investment firm co-founded by Hunter Biden, received $3.5 million in a wire transfer from [Yelena] Baturina, who allegedly received illegal construction contracts from her husband, the former mayor of Moscow.” The report said the wire transfer was part of a “consultancy agreement” but does not allege any illegality in the transaction.Allegedly, at the time of the transfer, Baturina was living in the United Kingdom with her late husband, Yuri Luzhkov, who died in 2019. But Hunter Biden’s lawyer said the claim that Hunter Biden received $3.5 million from Baturina is false.\n\n“The Senate report falsely alleges that Hunter Biden had a financial relationship with Russian businesswoman Yelena Baturina and that he received $3.5 million from Baturina,” said Biden’s lawyer George Mesires in an email. “Hunter Biden had no interest in and was not a ‘co-founder’ of Rosemont Seneca Thornton, so the claim that he was paid $3.5 million is false.”\n\nThe Senate report claimed that “Luzhkov used his position as mayor to approve over 20 real estate projects that were built by a Baturina-owned construction company and ultimately generated multibillion-ruble profits for his family.”\n\nTrump at one point hoped to be part of Moscow real estate projects overseen by Luzhkov when Luzhkov was mayor between 1992 and 2010. In an interview before his death, Luzhkov <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-negotiations-russia-moscow-mall-1320132\">told Russia’s Interfax news agency</a> that Trump planned to build a large underground mall in Moscow during the mid-1990s. “Trump was in Moscow,” Luzhkov said. “He had contacts on matters related to the construction of the Okhotny Ryad underground mall on Manezh Square.” But the deal did not come to fruition.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31316, 29801, 29887, 30157, 30213, 30509, 29208, 29291, 29340, 29582, 30080, 29102, 28543, 28068, 28156, 27947, 27879, 27641, 26940, 27039, 26744, 26811, 26693, 27073, 27492, 26334, 26261, 26080, 25640, 25718, 25558, 25340, 25148, 25236, 26543, 25997, 25939, 25975, 25843, 25087, 25105, 24992, 25136","repeated_count":"43","date":"10/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
