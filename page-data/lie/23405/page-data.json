It's all because of me. Then you hear the country doesn't like me. I mean, I can understand that, because President Obama and other presidents, in all fairness, would go in there and they'd make a speech and they'd leave. I went in there, I looked, and I said, 'This is unfair. We're paying for NATO.' We're paying for NATO. Almost all of it.”","analysis":"Trump’s $130 billion figure comes from a NATO estimate that its European members and Canada will spend $130 billion additionally on defense over the four years between 2016 and 2020. (The $130 billion is an estimate for cumulative defense spending through 2020, in 2015 dollars, as an increase over 2016 spending.) Trump falsely claims this is $130 billion a year, rather than over four years. The $400 billion figure is for eight years.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/07/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
