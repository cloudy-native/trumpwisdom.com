Insurance companies have actually lost billions in the Obamacare exchanges, according to company filings and industry analysts. For example, Aetna is on pace to lose $750 million from its participation in the exchanges — $100 million in 2014, $150 million in 2015, $300 million in 2016 and more than $200 million in 2017. As a result, it is not participating in 2018, a spokesman said. Humana announced it would leave the exchanges, saying it was too risky after losing $45 million in the individual market in 2017.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"1372, 1425, 1370, 1373, 1403, 1404, 1438, 1371, 1470","repeated_count":"9","date":"10/18/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
