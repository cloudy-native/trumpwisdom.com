And that whole program [of NASA sending astronauts to the moon and eventually to Mars] was dead when I took it over, when we came into office. … And everybody is doing a fantastic job. It's been totally reinvigorated, I think, to a level that it's never been at.”","analysis":"Trump claims credit for reinvigorating NASA, but things have hardly changed since he became president. The space agency already had plans to go to Mars as early as the 2030s. Those plans and the schedule are unchanged. Trump requested an extra $1.6 billion for NASA to return to the moon by 2024, but he claims credit for much more than that. For perspective, the total budget for 2020, with Trump's proposed $1.6 billion addition, would be $22.6 billion.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
