Our media is not free, it's not fare. It suppresses thought, it suppresses speech, and it's become the enemy of the people. It's become the enemy of the people. It's the biggest problem we have in this country....Now, what they do is they go silent. It's called suppression and that's what happens in a communist country. That's what they do, they suppress. You don't fight with them anymore unless it's a bad story. They have a little bad story about me. They make it 10 times worse and it's a major headline. But Hunter Biden, they don't talk about him. What happened to Hunter? Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? They don't talk about him.”","analysis":"Trump's comment offers the slander that there is no \"free and fair press\" and that it engages in suppression of news. The reality is that news organizations aim to confirm information -- such as allegations about Hunter Biden or election fraud -- rather than just report claims that may turn out to be false.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"31301, 31041, 31007, 30888, 31449, 30639","repeated_count":"6","date":"01/06/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
