South Korea -- remember, Hillary Clinton -- the great Hillary Clinton -- she said, ‘No, no we want this deal. It will produce 250,000 jobs.’ And she was right, for South Korea. They produced -- it's true. It got South Korea 250 [thousand].”","analysis":"Trump is referring to a free-trade agreement with South Korea that was negotiated by President George W. Bush’s administration and then tweaked by President Barack Obama’s; Hillary Clinton did not negotiate it, though Trump often claims that. Trump doubles the figure for the number of lost jobs for the U.S. free trade deal with South Korea that was claimed by one of his top trade aides. But even that's a dubious number disputed by mainstream economists. Trump made only minor adjustments to the pact.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"30060, 29110, 28783, 24765, 24088, 23999, 23275, 23068, 22063, 22602, 20038, 18859, 19526, 18472, 17245, 18278, 16335, 15696, 14062, 10340, 6211, 5437, 5365, 5366, 5823, 5224, 5242, 4819, 4842, 4844, 4942, 4762, 4601, 2747, 2860, 1685","repeated_count":"36","date":"03/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
