And Chuck wants to have this done. I really believe that. He wants to have this done. But she's calling the shots, and she's calling them because she wants the votes.

I know her contest very well; I know it maybe better than she does.”","analysis":"Pelosi must still be elected speaker when the new Congress meets but she appears to have secured the votes.
