They forced their children into failing schools, they shipped their jobs to foreign countries. They pushed their unfair sentencing policies. You know about that. Alice, you know Alice. And they favored illegal aliens over their own constituents. You know that. That's been happening for a long -- My administration is reversing these failed policies and delivering record gains for African-Americans.”","analysis":"This is overheated rhetoric. African-Americans are a core part of the Democratic base -- for a reason. Trump credits himself with turning around the economic fortunes of blacks, but the trends were on an upswing under Barack Obama. But the support for Democrats extends beyond economics. Democrats, rather than betraying blacks, often advanced policies that sought a more racial-neutral playing field for blacks.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/28/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
