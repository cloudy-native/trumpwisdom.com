But 9,653 of them were \"inadmissibles,\" which CBP defines as \"individuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible, individuals presenting themselves to seek humanitarian protection under our laws, and individuals who withdraw an application for admission and return to their countries of origin within a short timeframe.\" Moreover, the number of inadmissibles declined January to February, and although the total for southwest border apprehensions increased, it does not come close to the monthly records set in the early 2000s. A wall would not change the dynamic for inadmissibles, since they are applying for protection under humanitarian laws, presenting themselves at legal ports of entry, or returning quickly to their countries of origin. A wall would have to be built inland from the border, and U.S. asylum laws allow people to file an application as soon as they set foot in the country.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
