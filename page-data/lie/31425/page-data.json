After a massive registration drive by Democrats, Georgia is evenly split between the two parties -- as shown by the Senate races the Democrats won on Jan. 5 -- so this claimed margin of victory for Trump is ridiculous. He won the state by about 200,000 votes in 2016, and the margin was only going to shrink in 2020.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
