And I mean American jobs -- that's what we want.”","analysis":"Trump touted Foxconn's investment announcement, but the company considered investing in U.S.-based facilities since 2014, though its initial plans to invest in Pennsylvania didn't pan out. Moreover, the $3 billion incentives package offered by Wisconsin to lure Foxconn has not yet been approved by the Wisconsin Senate, amid concerns that the state would use taxpayer money for a project that would not generate profit for Wisconsin until 2042.
