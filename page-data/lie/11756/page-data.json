And it was sort of very sad, actually. Great reputation. He was President Obama and President Bush's doctor. He was my doctor. An excellent guy. An admiral and a doctor. And I said to him, how would you like to run the VA? And he said, sir -- he didn't want the job. He said, sir, I'll do whatever you'd like to do. So I threw his name out. Didn't really put him out. I threw it -- and the Democrats just absolutely went after him and were so unfair what they did to him. I said, welcome to the world of politics. Welcome to the world of living in Washington. And they went after him so viciously.”","analysis":"Sen. Jon Tester, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Veteran Affairs Committee, made public several allegations against Jackson. The White House conducted a review that found evidence of minor incidents but not the most serious allegations Tester had described, and the Secret Service released a statement denying several allegations. The Defense Department inspector general is investigating Jackson but has not released a report. Republicans believed Jackson to be unqualified, and Tester’s actions had the support of Veterans’ Affairs Committee chairman, Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.).","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"11756, 6800, 5478, 4849, 4874, 4925, 4112, 2958, 2960","repeated_count":"9","date":"06/14/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
