It ranks 16th for air quality and 26th for water and sanitation.  As for whether things have improved under Trump, that’s hard to track in the available data -- in fact, the number of unhealthy days in the United States went up from 2016 to 2017, according to government data --but he has taken a number of actions that could reverse or slow the gains made in air and water quality since 1990.  An analysis of Environmental Protection Agency data released in 2020 found that after improving for the better part of a decade, air quality in the U.S. is worsening again -- and could be associated with nearly 10,000 premature deaths. Fine particulate matter in the air Americans breathe fell by 24 percent between 2009 and 2016. But concentrations have increased by 5.5 percent in 2017 and 2018, and premature deaths associated with exposure to the dangerous particles spiked by 9,700 in 2018, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w26381\">the study</a> said.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30614, 27011, 26807, 26463, 26206, 23713, 21823, 22688, 21186, 22570, 20281, 17995, 17622, 17207, 16760, 16108, 16188, 16448, 15489, 14046, 13737, 12756, 12934, 13263, 12326, 11338, 11945, 11196, 10308, 10311, 11000, 9945, 7405, 7443, 7028, 6044, 5212, 5965, 5695","repeated_count":"39","date":"09/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
