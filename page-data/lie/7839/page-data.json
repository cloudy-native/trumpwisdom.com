But human trafficking — grabbing women, in particular — and children, but women — taping them up, wrapping tape around their mouths so they can't shout or scream, tying up their hands behind their back and even their legs and putting them in a back seat of a car or a van — three, four, five, six, seven at a time.”","analysis":"Mentioning women trafficked with tape over their mouths has become a standard part of Trump’s talking points on the need for a border wall. But human-trafficking experts and advocates for immigrant women have said they are perplexed by this tale in Trump’s repertoire — and are at a loss for where he got his information. No prominent news reports have detailed a case that matches the president’s description.
