But now as you know I got over $100 billion from NATO countries. But that’s not enough, that’s not enough, we're paying for massive portions of NATO. We shouldn't be paying for this. They should be paying their own way, and we can help them, but we shouldn't be paying for — and by the way, here’s a beauty. We pay for their military defense and then they take advantage of us on trade in addition. It used to be in order to have the trade we take care of them — but they get us both ways.”","analysis":"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said last summer that NATO allies had spent $41 billion more toward defense since Trump took office. He said in an interview with Fox News on Jan. 27 that NATO allies will have added $100 billion extra toward defense by the end of 2020. But the effort to push NATO members to spend more on defense began well before Trump took office. At the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, the Obama administration secured an agreement by member nations to aim to increase their spending on defense to 2 percent of each nation’s gross domestic product within 10 years. In any case, the money would not be going to the United States or even necessarily to NATO; this is money that countries would spend to bolster their own military, which in turn supports all of NATO.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"22894, 21863, 22800, 22744, 22680, 20561, 19704, 17336, 16131, 14590, 15786, 15005, 15026, 14001, 13919, 13617, 13565, 12703, 12564, 12394, 11563, 12100, 11986, 11460, 11836, 11215, 11761, 11121, 10908, 10910, 10697, 10478, 10552, 10897, 10349, 9877, 9636, 9640, 9285, 9027, 8997, 8635, 6407, 4587","repeated_count":"44","date":"03/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
