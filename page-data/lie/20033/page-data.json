I said, let's get it down from $50,000 to $25,000 because they're delinquent, for many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number. And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current.”","analysis":"Since 2006, each NATO member has had a guideline of spending at least 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending, with a goal of reaching that level by 2024. Germany is not making payments to NATO and thus is not \"delinquent\" in payments to NATO.
