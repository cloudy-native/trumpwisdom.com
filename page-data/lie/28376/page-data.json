Biden has said he would consider a lockdown if recommended by scientists as a way to prevent a surge in the disease; he did not make any pledge to do so. He indicated often such a lockdown would be an extreme option he would have to consider with care, but he would be guided by science. Biden generally was a bigger advocate of mask mandates to help stem the spread of the coronavirus.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"29764, 29824, 30176, 30208, 30233, 29233, 29298, 29348, 29419, 29621, 29651, 29471, 29565, 29728, 28717, 28944, 29075, 29162, 28605, 28653, 28419, 28518, 28376, 28767, 28814, 29026, 28012, 28051, 28133, 28295, 27976, 27585, 27805, 27866, 27718, 26779, 26618, 27061, 27398, 26928, 27304, 27453, 26444, 26490, 26134, 25673, 25548, 25454, 25605, 26571, 25808, 26049, 25860, 24841, 24674, 24383, 24478, 23969, 23350, 23738, 23818, 23695, 23396, 23500, 23538, 21540, 22033, 21963, 22438, 22541, 22262","repeated_count":"71","date":"10/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
