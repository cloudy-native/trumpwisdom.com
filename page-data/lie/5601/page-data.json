This is in large part because transfer payments — such as the earned-income tax credit or food stamps — are not recorded as income, so their impact isn’t incorporated into the official figure.

For African Americans, the SPM's  lowest point was in 2016 with a slight uptick in 2017.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"17149, 15341, 14403, 14080, 12210, 11363, 11510, 10606, 8904, 7284, 7378, 7384, 6591, 5907, 5416, 5601, 5527","repeated_count":"17","date":"10/10/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
