They had their chance, but pretended to rush. Most unfair & corrupt hearing in Congressional history!”","analysis":"Trump and his allies claim that House Democrats violated the president's due-process rights in the impeachment inquiry, because Trump wasn't allowed to have counsel present during closed-door depositions and wasn't allowed to call or cross-examine witnesses. This is a great example of how politicians use legalese to mislead the public. First of all, the Constitution says the Senate holds impeachment trials, so a president would have an opportunity to defend himself at that stage, as he did. The House assumes the role of the prosecutor, filing charges. The Fifth and Fourteenth amendments guarantee due process for defendants in court who could be \"deprived of life, liberty, or property.\" Impeachment is a different procedure that turns on congressional votes, and the maximum penalty is removal from office. The Constitution gives wide discretion to the House and Senate to establish rules for impeachment, and it doesn't require that officeholders get due-process rights. Near the end of the impeachment inquiry in the House, the Judiciary Committee invited Trump's legal counsel to appear, but the White House declined the invitation.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"17070, 17083, 17101, 16485, 16046, 16038, 16031, 16383, 15953, 16364, 15894, 15972, 16022, 14581, 15022, 14763, 14931, 14817, 14854, 15766, 14711, 14448, 14466, 15759, 15722, 15723, 14546, 14532, 15654, 15301, 15626, 14286, 15160, 14217, 13899","repeated_count":"35","date":"01/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
