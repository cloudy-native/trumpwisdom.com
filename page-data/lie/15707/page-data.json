He and others also stated that there was..... .....‘no pressure’ put on him to investigate Sleepy Joe Biden even though, as President, I have an ‘obligation’ to look into corruption, and Biden’s actions, on tape, about firing the prosecutor, and his son’s taking millions of dollars, with no knowledge or talent, from a..... ....Ukrainian energy company, and more millions taken from China, and now reports of other companies and countries also giving him big money, are certainly looking very corrupt (to put it mildly!) to me. Both Bidens should be forced to testify in this No Due Process Scam!”","analysis":"Where to begin? One, some of the strongest evidence in the impeachment inquiry came from Trump: his public remarks and the rough transcript of his phone call with the president of Ukraine. Two, the administration officials who testified have said they're not \"never Trumpers.\" Three, the president of Ukraine actually said \"no one can pressure me,\" and in a later interview criticized Trump for delaying security aid funds meant for Ukraine. Four, the facts don't support Trump's claim that he held up the funds due to corruption concerns in Ukraine. Five, Trump's claims on Biden and corruption in Ukraine and China have been roundly debunked. Six, due process rights do not extend to federal officials facing impeachment.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
