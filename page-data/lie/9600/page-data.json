Mexico was a relatively small player in North American vehicle production before NAFTA, producing only 3 percent of the continent’s vehicles in 1987, and it now makes about 20 percent of light vehicles. U.S. share of North American vehicle production was 70 percent in 2007 and is projected to be about 60 percent in 2020, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/The-Growing-Role-of-Mexico-in-the-North-American-Automotive-Industry-Trends-Drivers-and-Forecasts.pdf#page=16\">according to a 2016 report by the Center for Automotive Research</a>. But about 80 percent of Mexico's production is for export. Mexico has signed nearly 50 free-trade agreements, and so much of the new auto production there is coming from Asia and Europe, not the United States. Moreover, unlike Mexico, the United States cannot export to many South American countries duty free because it does not have the same free-trade agreements.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/29/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
