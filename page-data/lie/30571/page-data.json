Without evidence, but apparently based on a stew of misinformation derived mostly from Internet rumors and right-wing blogs, Trump claimed that Dominion machines deleted or switched votes that had been cast for him. (Trump’s allies have falsely claimed the Dominion machines are under the control of software made by a company linked to the Venezuelan government that is designed to change election results.) Such claims were repeatedly discredited by hand counts of ballots that confirmed the machine counts. The company operates in 28 states, including Florida and Ohio, two states that Trump easily won. But the contracts are often with individual counties. For instance, Dominion software was used in only two of the five counties that had problems in Michigan and Georgia — and the problems in Michigan were due to human error, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/Antrim_Fact_Check_707197_7.pdf\">according to a detailed account posted by the Michigan secretary of state’s office</a>. The machine count was later <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/12/audit-in-michigan-county-refutes-dominion-conspiracy-theory/\">confirmed</a> by a hand count in December. (The Trump campaign requested a recount in Wisconsin, but strangely not in counties that used Dominion systems.) In the 14 counties in which Dominion voting machines were used in Wisconsin, the president got 59% of the vote. And the counties in Pennsylvania where Dominion voting machines were used, he got 52.5% of the vote. The company has indicated it is considering a lawsuit against Trump for defamation.
