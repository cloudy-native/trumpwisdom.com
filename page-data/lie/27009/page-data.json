It's filthy, the air is filthy, the Paris accord. I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly when they put us in there. They did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris accord.”","analysis":"Each country set its own commitments under the Paris Accord, so Trump's comment is puzzling. He could unilaterally change the commitments offered by former President Barack Obama, which is technically allowed under the Accord. Plus, as we've noted before, Trump ignores any possible benefits that could come from tackling climate change, including potential green jobs.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30935, 30612, 30011, 28017, 28226, 27009, 26806, 27465, 26464, 26066, 25892, 24767, 24847, 23994, 23712, 23414, 23462, 23257, 23052, 22364, 20975, 21602, 22546, 21320, 21363, 21824, 22684, 21422, 21465, 21191, 22572, 21074, 17623, 17208, 16189, 16010, 15682, 15358, 14048, 12757, 12306, 11082, 11465, 11798, 10648, 10999, 10246, 9942, 7616, 7567, 6043, 6361, 5779, 5694, 5031, 4614, 4255, 4162, 2363, 1901, 1858, 1090, 0833, 0765, 0731","repeated_count":"65","date":"10/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
