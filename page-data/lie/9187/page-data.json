Nobody knew too much about it until recently. It's been going on for a million years, actually. It's been going on for a long time. But we've seen it. We've spotted it. It's being slowed down, but we can't slow it down unless we have a very strong and powerful separation between us and whoever it is it may be. And in this case, it happens to be Mexico.”","analysis":"Trump appears to claim credit for having \"spotted\" human trafficking. Though human trafficking is a major issue in some regions of the world, experts and available evidence indicate trafficking for sexual exploitation is not a serious problem in the United States. A recent study funded by the Justice Department concluded the total number of juveniles in the sex trade in the United States was about 9,000 to 10,000. Trump says it is worse than ever before, but the statistics are guesstimates that should be viewed with skepticism. Given that most human trafficking takes place through legal ports of entry, such as airports, there is no evidence a wall on the southern border would make much of an impact.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"21506, 21460, 21122, 19399, 19155, 18608, 16871, 18307, 15193, 11544, 12104, 12052, 11498, 10102, 9771, 9187, 8782, 8701, 8650, 8431, 8489, 7804, 8172, 8099, 8101, 8105, 8074, 7973, 7881, 7655, 7107, 6810, 7053, 7083, 6166, 3513, 3944, 3013, 2645, 2750, 2692, 8605, 0945, 0532, 0456, 0445, 0448","repeated_count":"47","date":"03/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
