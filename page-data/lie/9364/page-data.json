I endorsed him at his request, and I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted -- which, as president, I had to approve. I don't care about this. I didn't get ‘thank you.’ That's okay. We sent him on the way. But I wasn't a fan of John McCain.”","analysis":"Trump did not have to approve McCain's funeral. When McCain's casket lay in state in the Capitol, that was approved by Congress. His services in the National Cathedral were approved by the church. Trump actually did get thanks from the McCain family. The president authorized a military transport for McCain's casket from Arizona to Washington.
