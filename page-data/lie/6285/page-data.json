Did you know that? Two-thirds. And the rest were on fumes. More than one-third of the steel jobs -- and now it was getting up to about 62 percent -- were vanquished, they were gone. You could say vanquished and vanished. It's a combination of both. More than 70,000 hard-working Americans saw their jobs eliminated and their way of life destroyed.”","analysis":"The slide in U.S. steel worker jobs has in large part been the result of increases in efficiency, not foreign competition. Labor productivity has seen a fivefold increase since the early 1980s, going from an average of 10 hours of work for each finished ton to an average of two hours in 2016, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Thanks to automation, workers in control rooms operate equipment that used to require hundreds of people. Open vessels once used to melt raw material have been replaced by more labor- and energy-efficient furnaces.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/27/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
