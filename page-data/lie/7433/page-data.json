Many of these people are leaving now, and they're going back to their countries: Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador and other countries. They're leaving. If you noticed, it’s getting a lot less crowded in Mexico. And a lot of them are going to stay in Mexico, and the Mexican government has been working with us very well. So we appreciate that. But they haven't been coming into our country.”","analysis":"This appears to be a reference to the migrant caravans from Central America. In the run-up to the midterm elections, Trump described the caravans as a menacing invasion headed to the U.S. border. Now, he claims “many of these people are leaving now, and they're going back to their countries” or staying in Mexico. The Washington Post’s Kevin Sieff and Joshua Partlow, who have spent time with the caravan members in Mexico, reported Nov. 28 that many of them were opting to return to their home countries. But it doesn't appear to be a critical mass. “There are still more than 6,000 migrants from the caravan at the sports complex in Tijuana, and most of them intend to wait weeks or months to apply for asylum in the United States,” Sieff and Partlow reported. “But the number making other decisions — to stay in Mexico or to return to Central America — is slowly growing.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/11/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
