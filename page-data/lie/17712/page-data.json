Trump once admitted in a legal deposition that he sometimes gives estimates of his financial condition based on gut feeling. Trump's net worth is estimated to be about $3 billion. It's highly unlikely being president will cost him more than his net worth -- and he could well profit from it, since he and his family often blur the line between official actions and private business interests, and because he has refused to divest from his business.\n\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"28829, 28160, 27269, 26446, 26081, 17712, 14126, 13845, 13713, 13275, 12307","repeated_count":"11","date":"03/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
