And that got whittled down in every case. They got whittled down. Today, we're on track to win Arizona. We only need to carry, I guess, 55 percent of the remaining vote, 55 percent margins.”","analysis":"Here, Trump contradicts himself. He complains about losing margins in Wisconsin and Michigan — which have now been called for Biden — but brags about how the votes still being counted in Arizona have cut into Biden’s margins. (That’s because Republicans in Arizona are used to voting by mail.) At the time it was not clear whether Trump can score a victory in Arizona, but if he had, it’s because of the “illegal” votes he complains about. (He ultimately lost Arizona.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
