How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would've done same!”","analysis":"Trump blasts previous administrations for letting trade deficits with China to climb. But the United States is not losing \"100s of billions of dollars\" on trade deficits. That reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Americans want to buy these products from overseas, either because of quality or price. If Trump sparked a trade war and tariffs were increased on Chinese goods, then it would raise the cost of those products to Americans. Perhaps that would reduce the purchases of those goods, and thus reduce the trade deficit, but that would not mean the United States would “gain” money that had been lost.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/09/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
