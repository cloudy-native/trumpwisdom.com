I haven't even started campaigning yet, and am constantly fighting Fake News like Russia, Russia, Russia. Look at North Carolina last night. Dan Bishop, down big in the Polls, WINS. Easier than 2016!”","analysis":"Where to begin? The ABC tracking poll found that Trump was down 12 points -- not 15 -- in its initial wave, released on Oct. 23, 2016. The Washington Post co-sponsored later waves of the survey with ABC, Hillary Clinton's advantage shrank as the vote drew nearer, and the difference remained very close up till Election Day, with Clinton up 47 percent to 43 percent at last count. (She won the popular vote by 2.1 percentage points.) This year, virtually all polls show that Trump would lose in a head-to-head matchup with Biden, Warren and nearly every leading Democrat in the race. News and polling organizations do not publish \"suppression polls,\" which in Trump's parlance are polls that relay false information to demoralize and dissuade people from voting. Trump has been holding campaign rallies for months, belying his claim that he has not begun campaigning. Special counsel Robert Mueller found that Trump's 2016 campaign knew about and sought to exploit Russia's help in the presidential election, but not enough evidence to charge a conspiracy. (Mueller did find evidence that Trump potentially obstructed justice during the investigation several times.) FInally, Bishop was not \"down big\" in the polls. He and his Democratic opponent were in a close race as measured by various surveys.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
