The stock market is doing well, but his scorekeeping is fishy. For example, on Oct. 10, 2019, he said “the stock market today just hit another all-time high,” but the Dow Jones industrial average was higher nine days earlier. According to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/dow-jones-closing-history-top-highs-and-lows-since-1929-3306174\">the Balance</a>, a personal finance website, the Dow Jones had broken 44 records from the time Trump took office through Jan. 9, 2020. It is worthing noting that between Inauguration Day and Jan. 4 of the fourth year of their respective presidencies, the stock market grew 63 percent under Trump, vs. 82 percent under Obama.
