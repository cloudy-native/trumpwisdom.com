Every prosecutor takes an oath to uphold the law, not to advance a political agenda. Last year, in Philadelphia, a robber shot and gravely injured a deli owner. He was a good man. He'll never be the same. But he may serve -- this criminal -- a sentence that is very short. In fact, they're looking at about three years, if you can believe this. Three years. Dangerous criminals must be punished to the fullest extent of the law.”","analysis":"Trump is citing the lower-end of the plea agreement for Jovaun Patterson, the robber and shooter.

On Feb. 28, U.S. Attorney William McSwain announced that a federal grand jury indicted Patterson on charges of attempted robbery under the federal Hobbs Act and with carrying and using a firearm in a crime of violence. If convicted under the federal firearm statute, Patterson would face a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, consecutive to any other sentence he is to serve.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
