I call them the 'super-duper missiles,' the ones that go so fast, you can't even see them. And now we have that. You probably read about it last night. We have the fastest, by far, in the world.”","analysis":"Trump appears to be referring to hypersonic weapons, namely hypersonic glide vehicles (HGV) that can reach speeds of at least Mach 5, or roughly 3,800 mph. Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association, {told Business Insider}. Trump's mention of speeds that were faster could have been in reference to the estimated speeds of the HGVs, which range from at least Mach 5 to around Mach 20. But Trump's suggestion that HGVs are faster than existing missiles is false and reflects a misunderstanding of their capabilities, Reif said. \"The reported speed of these weapons (and hypersonic cruise missiles, which are slower than HGVs) are indeed faster than existing conventionally armed US air- and sea-delivered missiles such as the [Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile] and Tomahawk cruise missiles, which fly at subsonic speeds,\" Reif said. \"But they are not faster than US nuclear-armed intercontinental-range ballistic missiles. These missiles reach hypersonic speeds in excess of Mach 20.\" He added: \"Trump is well known for serving up nonsensical word salads, and this was no exception.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/16/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
