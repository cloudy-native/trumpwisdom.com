When is somebody going to pull this string? Come on, fellas. That's terrible. 33,000 emails. Try going to court some time on a civil case. … She deleted and acid washed, right? Who acid-washed?

Moreover, there’s no evidence Clinton deleted the emails in anticipation of the subpoena, and FBI director James B. Comey has said his agency’s investigation found no evidence that any work-related emails were “intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"29815, 29881, 28925, 27045, 26985, 25500, 25381, 25209, 25819, 25097, 24908, 24530, 24531, 24443, 24159, 23932, 18385, 18430, 17161, 14921, 15488, 14638, 14221, 13811, 13110, 13058, 13406, 12414, 11343, 11866, 11160, 11163, 11192, 11785, 11746, 11088, 10951, 10764, 10140, 9443, 8472, 6546, 6482, 5462, 5928, 5012, 4407, 4359, 3039, 2740, 2741, 0922, 0858, 0956","repeated_count":"54","date":"09/17/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
