You know that. And we approved -- right? The Dakota Access Pipeline. I came in -- those two, I did them in my first week or less. And it was 48,000 jobs.”","analysis":"Trump appears to be combining two disputed figures — 28,000 jobs for Keystone XL and 12,000 for the Dakota Access Pipeline. We have looked closely at the Keystone numbers, and the same methodological issues appear to apply to the Dakota estimates. The actual number of Keystone construction jobs, for instance, is just 3,900 on an annualized basis — and other jobs have already been created (such as for building high-strength line pipe.) In the context of the U.S. economy, which adds between 100,000 and 200,000 jobs a month, these are not many jobs. The Keystone XL pipeline still has not been built.","pinocchios":"2","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"20987, 22545, 17999, 18471, 16970, 17510, 14040, 15099, 10992, 10461, 10015, 9940, 9941, 9379, 7176, 6362, 5846, 4783, 4378, 4306, 4161, 2738, 2405, 2330, 2191, 2132, 1860, 1603, 1574, 1262, 1259, 1211, 1124, 0783, 0834, 0741, 0691, 0627, 0484, 0354, 0327, 0180, 0151, 0115, 0094, 0018","repeated_count":"46","date":"03/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
