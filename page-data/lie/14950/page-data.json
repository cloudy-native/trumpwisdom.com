Though Trump has made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his first term, his administration <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/the-trump-administrations-immigration-jails-are-packed-but-deportations-are-lower-than-in-obama-era/2019/11/17/27ad0e44-f057-11e9-89eb-ec56cd414732_story.html\">lags far behind</a> President Barack Obama’s pace of deportations. Obama — who immigrant advocates at one point called the “deporter in chief” — removed 409,849 people in 2012 alone. Trump, who has vowed to deport “millions” of immigrants, has yet to surpass 260,000 deportations in a single year. Meanwhile, Customs and Border Control data on border apprehensions haven't reached the same peaks previous presidents have seen, though they surged early in 2019 and then seemed to placate in recent months. If Trump is referring only to people who get immediately blocked and returned at the border, the claim is still wrong because most of them are from Mexico and Canada, not Central America.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
