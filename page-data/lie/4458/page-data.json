And now we have probably the best there is in the world.”","analysis":"Trump engages in misplaced hyperbole here. The United States had plenty of safeguards on intellectual property theft -- not \"very, very little\" -- and little has changed under his administration. It's possible that Trump is referring to his trade war with China, which was spurred on by intellectual property theft by Beijing, But the way he frames it here is misleading.
