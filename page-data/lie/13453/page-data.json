Your average prescription drug price -- first time in 50 years -- over 50 years.”","analysis":"The CPI for prescription drugs in 2018 fell for the first time in 46 years. And that’s only when focusing on calendar years, which is somewhat arbitrary. The president’s record shrinks to five-and-a-half years when looking at the most recent 12-month decline, for the year ended July 2013. However, experts say the CPI for prescription drugs fails to account for rebates, which can be substantial, and may be giving a skewed picture because of recent market shifts toward generics and electronic payments by third parties. A range of studies we found shows that drug prices have not declined, especially when it comes to branded drugs.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
