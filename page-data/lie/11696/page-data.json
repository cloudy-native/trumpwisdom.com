But racist tropes have made their way into Trump’s language on multiple occasions. Most recently, the president tweeted that four Democratic minority Congresswomen — all Americans — should “go back” to where they came from. Washington Post Executive Editor Martin Baron noted in a statement, ”The ‘go back’ trope is deeply rooted in the history of racism in the United States.
