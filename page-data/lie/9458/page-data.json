Security Council declared “null and void and without international legal effect.” No president has campaigned to formally support the annexation. Before Trump. U.S. policy had been to support the ongoing quid pro quo between Israel and Syria around the Golan Heights, with diplomatic efforts in the Clinton and Obama administrations to resolve the dispute in a satisfactory manner for both countries.
