I don't even know that but it's the Obama Justice Department. And they went after Chris Christie and they went after that group of people. And I was so happy to see it was at nine nothing. No, I actually called Chris and congratulated him. And you're right; it destroyed his probably political career in a certain way. But I think now he can come back. That's better than a pardon in a certain way. That's better than a pardon, it's better than anything you can get. We talked about it yesterday nine to nothing including some very liberal judges voting -- justices voting in favor. So, I thought it was a great achievement to the sense and Chris fought that long and hard. He's been fighting for years and so have the others. You got to give them and their lawyers a lot of credit and they won nine nothing. And it's a little bit different than our situation but it's still a corrupt group of prosecutors going after Republicans.”","analysis":"This is rank revisionism. The scandal here was that Christie's aides in 2013 used a transportation agency to rejigger toll-booth lanes so that traffic would swamp the town of Fort Lee, N.J., for several days. They were punishing the local mayor, who declined to endorse Christie's reelection as New Jersey governor that year. The \"Bridgegate\" prosecution was directed by the U.S. attorney in New Jersey at the time, Paul Fishman, a Democrat, and federal officials posted in the state. Trump suggests the orders were coming from Comey and other top Justice Department officials in Washington whom he resents over the Russia investigation, but that's a retroactive invention. These comments from Trump came after the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the convictions of two Christie aides in 2020. The court pointedly said their conduct was \"corrupt\" and deceitful -- hardly an exoneration -- but that prosecutors chose an inadequate statute to charge criminality. Christie never \"fought that long and hard\" or \"for years,\" as Trump (and Christie himself) would claim after the court decision. In fact, it was the reverse. Christie profusely apologized for Bridgegate when the scandal threatened his governorship, fired the aides in question and said the jury \"affirmed\" his decision by convicting them. Only years later did Christie change his tune and start attacking Fishman and whitewashing the traffic scandal.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
