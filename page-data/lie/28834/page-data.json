Biden opposed sending in the National Guard. We sent in the National Guard and we saved Kenosha. We saved Kenosha. Kenosha wouldn't be standing... And I got a lot of credit. Thank you to the sheriff and so many others for their support. They've actually came out and supported me.”","analysis":"Trump takes too much credit for the relative calm that has settled over Kenosha, a city roiled by protests and violence. The governor, not the president, sent the National Guard to Kenosha. And the presence of guardsmen was not the sole factor in tamping down the violence that erupted after a white police officer on Aug. 23 shot and partially paralyzed Jacob Blake in front of his children. The next day, Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin authorized the state National Guard to support local law enforcement. Maj. Gen. Paul E. Knapp, who commands the Wisconsin National Guard, noted that about 1,000 members of the state’s guard were on the scene and said it was the governor who made the final call on the guard’s deployment.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"30160, 28941, 28834, 27589, 27229, 24393, 23899, 23905, 23825, 23464, 23451, 23306, 23046, 23305","repeated_count":"14","date":"10/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
