And it was a very powerful decision, a very strong decision, backed up –- I understand they're going to be releasing hundreds of pages of proof and evidence – but we are very, very happy with that decision. It was a powerful decision that left no doubt, so I want to thank the House intelligence committee and all of the people that voted.”","analysis":"The House Intelligence Committee made no such conclusion. The Republican majority offered preliminary conclusions, released in a one-page summary of a draft 150-page report, which said they found “no evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy” between the Trump campaign and Russia. Democrats on the committee have said that the investigation was incomplete and that key witnesses had not been interviewed. The House panel investigation has been deeply split along partisan lines from the start, in contrast to a parallel Senate inquiry.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"3862, 4137, 3061, 2950, 2957, 2930, 2770, 2603, 2576, 2719, 2623","repeated_count":"11","date":"03/13/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
