The four-page special section, made to appear like a newspaper but branded on top of each page with a line noting \"Section sponsored by China Daily,\" criticized Trump's trade war with China. This is hardly the kind of electoral interference that Russia engaged in during the 2016 race. Russia stole and strategically released Democrats' emails, hacked into voter databases and spread online propaganda through fake personas. China's advertisement was crafty, but it openly stated it was paid for by the Chinese. It's a stretch to say this rises to election interference instead of just a salvo in the trade war.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
