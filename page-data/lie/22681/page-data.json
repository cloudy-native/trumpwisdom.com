And why would we keep all of those troops there? And now Germany is saying it's bad for their economy. Well, it's good for our economy. Germany is delinquent. They're at 1 percent. They should be at 2 percent.”","analysis":"NATO members were never “delinquent” in their payments. That’s not how NATO works.
