About 1 percent happen after the fetus reaches the point of viability. Trump and anti abortion advocates have claimed for months that Biden or other Democrats support abortion “up until the moment of birth,” a claim we have awarded Three Pinocchios.\n\nThey argue that some laws and court decisions have opened loopholes that allow abortions to the very end of a pregnancy. Experts have told us abortions up to the moment of birth, what could be described as infanticide, are not happening in the United States.\n\nBiden supports abortion rights and says he would codify in statute the Supreme Court’s landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade and related precedents, which generally limit abortions to the first 20 to 24 weeks of gestation.\n\nOther candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have said they favor no restrictions on abortion. But both co-sponsored the Women’s Health Protection Act, which prohibits states from banning abortion before the fetus reaches viability (the Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey framework).","pinocchios":"3","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"27181, 27448, 25592, 25089, 24039, 24094, 24004, 22090, 22912, 20046, 18624, 18422, 17851, 18317, 16855, 18188, 16554, 16213, 16353, 18630, 14957, 14725, 15377, 15611, 15002, 15527, 14680, 18629, 15112, 13887, 13726, 18628, 12113, 18626, 18627, 18625, 18631","repeated_count":"37","date":"08/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
