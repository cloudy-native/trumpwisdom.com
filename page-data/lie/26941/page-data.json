That’s what it was. It was open and it was closed in 2015, I believe.”","analysis":"Trump made this remark during the second presidential debate after Joe Biden charged: “We learned this president paid 50 times the tax in China [compared with his U.S. tax bill], has a secret bank account with China, does business in China.” But Trump never disclosed that he had a Chinese bank account. The New York Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/trump-taxes-china.html\">revealed its existence</a> n a report published this week and also reported that Trump had accounts in Britain and Ireland.\n\nTrump has refused to release his tax returns and instead offers his financial disclosures filed with government ethics officials. Those disclosures are not as detailed as the tax returns would be. The Times said it obtained data from his tax returns for its report.\n\n“The foreign accounts do not show up on Mr. Trump’s public financial disclosures, where he must list personal assets, because they are held under corporate names. The identities of the financial institutions are not clear,” the Times reported. “The Chinese account is controlled by Trump International Hotels Management L.L.C., which the tax records show paid $188,561 in taxes in China while pursuing licensing deals there from 2013 to 2015.”\n\nTrump said he believed the account was closed in 2015. That’s not what his lawyer said.\n\n“No deals, transactions or other business activities ever materialized and, since 2015, the office has remained inactive,” Trump lawyer Alan Garten told the Times. “Though the bank account remains open, it has never been used for any other purpose.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
