This statistic comes from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/The-Economic-Effects-of-Federal-Deregulation-Interim-Report.pdf\">a report</a> issued in June 2019 by his Council of Economic Advisers, which calculated such savings five to ten years in the future. But Trump frequently suggests the savings are already being received by households. The report makes a number of generous assumptions about the impact of deregulation in order come up with this figure, but experts we consulted found the assumptions and conclusions to be dubious. One expert cited in the report said the analysis was “just crazy” and “anti-academic.” The report also does not account for administration actions that have lowered household incomes, such as the president's tariff war.
