No such screening and testing website was ever developed by Google. Around the time of Trump’s announcement, Google communications tweeted a statement from Verily, the life sciences division of Google parent company Alphabet that focuses on research and development concerning health issues: “We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time.” The New York Times reported that “the 1,700 engineers Mr. Trump mentioned were actually just Google employees who said a day earlier that they would be happy to volunteer their time on the project if needed.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/13/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
