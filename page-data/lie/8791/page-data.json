We want to stop those journeys. The way you do that is with barrier security, a wall. And we're making a lot of progress.”","analysis":"Trump professes to be concerned about Central American women being sexually assaulted on the journey to the United States, but his solution would hardly help. Thousands of Central Americans are journeying to the United States to seek asylum. Since a wall would be built some distance inland from the border, and asylum claims can be made after setting foot anywhere in the country, a wall would not change the incentive behind this mass migration phenomenon. The women Trump is referring to in many cases are fleeing violence or domestic abuse or the threat of sexual assault in their home countries.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"24554, 24149, 21279, 13707, 10886, 8968, 8826, 8791, 8488, 8387, 7841, 7842, 7840, 7839, 8255, 7837, 7838, 7972","repeated_count":"18","date":"02/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
