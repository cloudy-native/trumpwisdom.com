I tell people when I'm in farm country, I said, 'You know, now if you have a farm -- ,' they used to leave it and the kids would have to go out and borrow a lot of money because they make an income but it's hard. The land is sometimes worth more than the income. And they go borrow money at the end up losing it to a bank a couple of years later. It's -- -not going to be worried about any longer. Now they don't have the Death Tax. They don't have what's known as the Estate Tax. We got rid of it.”","analysis":"This is an enormous stretch. Trump often claims he saved family farms and small businesses by gradually reducing the federal estate tax. (It was not fully eliminated, though Trump often says he got rid of it.) Reducing the estate tax primarily benefits the wealthy. The estate tax rarely falls on farms or small businesses, since only those leaving behind more than $5 million pay it. According to the Tax Policy Center, nearly 5,500 estates in 2017 — out of nearly 3 million — were subject to the tax. Of those, only 80 taxable estates would be farms and small businesses.
