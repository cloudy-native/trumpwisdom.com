For three years, this President has been harassed. He’s been electronically surveilled, spied upon, allegations have never ceased, they continue, and their continuing today. At some point you would think you would look at the abuse..... ....by Congress, by the Justice Department & FBI friends of the Democrats, who hated the president when he was nothing but a candidate. At some point somebody should have said, wait a minute, this is out of control, this train is off the tracks, it’s time to get reasonable.”","analysis":"This diatribe has no basis in fact. Trump's campaign was not spied upon or electronically surveilled. Courts and independent watchdog agencies have found that the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign was legal and supported by facts. Special counsel Robert Mueller found that the Trump campaign was aware of and welcomed Russian assistance in the 2016 election, though there was not enough evidence for conspiracy charges. Mueller also found multiple instances of potential obstruction of justice committed by the president during the course of the investigation. Congress uncovered serious concerns -- within Trump's own National Security Council -- about the president's dealings with Ukraine.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
