Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart, there was no Collusion except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, they say, “gee, I have an idea, let’s look at Trump’s finances and every deal he has ever done. Let’s follow discredited Michael Cohen and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday. No way, it’s time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt. Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now!”","analysis":"There's no evidence that the special counsel investigation is a witch hunt or a hoax. In fact, the special counsel has revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities.The special counsel concluded Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons associated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks. But a summary of the special counsel's report, released by Attorney General William Barr, concluded the investigation \"did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\" There's no evidence to suggest Cohen's recent testimony was fraudulent. Plus, several of Trump's business deals are under investigation by various law enforcement organizations and those investigations are not new.
