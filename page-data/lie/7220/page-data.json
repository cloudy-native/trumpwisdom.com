In fact a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad (cruel) we are, but it was in 2014 during O years. Obama separated children from parents, as did Bush etc., because that is the policy and law. I tried to keep them together but the problem is, when you do that, vast numbers of additional people storm the Border. So with Obama separation is fine, but with Trump it’s not. Fake 60 Minutes!”","analysis":"There is simply no comparison between Trump’s family separation policy and the border enforcement actions taken by the Obama and George W. Bush administrations. The president keeps refusing to acknowledge the scope of his family separations.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26975, 20055, 12519, 11691, 11985, 11942, 11434, 11895, 11260, 11825, 11847, 11848, 11849, 10300, 9859, 7627, 7410, 7220, 7086, 5550, 5958, 6104, 4759, 4774, 3502","repeated_count":"25","date":"11/25/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
