So dead people voted, and I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters.”","analysis":"Another ludicrous number. During a state hearing, secretary of state counsel Ryan Germany said they have found a total of two dead people who voted. “Usually, that’s somebody who died recently, and a family member votes with [the name],” Germany said. “That handful of instances are consistent with what we see in every election. Again, it’s not okay.” During the call, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger also said: \"The actual number were two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted. So that’s wrong.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
