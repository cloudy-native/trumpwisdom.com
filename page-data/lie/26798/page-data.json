Can you imagine if we didn't have? It would have been my word against Shifty Schiff and all of the horrible human beings over there, they died when they found out we had a transcription. Remember? They wanted to know how do we get out of this one. So we had to beat that one off too, but that was a little bit lucky. Thank you to your wonderful transcribers, you did a great job.”","analysis":"It was not an exact transcript. The memo released by the White House includes a “caution” note saying it “is not a verbatim transcript.” Current and former U.S. officials studying the document pointed to several elements that, they say, indicate that the document may have been handled in an unusual way, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/03/odd-markings-ellipses-fuel-doubts-about-rough-transcript-trumps-ukraine-call/\">the Washington Post reported.</a> Those include the use of ellipses — punctuation indicating that information has been deleted for clarity or other reasons — that traditionally have not appeared in summaries of presidential calls with foreign leaders. Moreover, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, told House impeachment investigators that the White House transcript of a July call between President Trump and Ukraine’s president omitted crucial words and phrases, and that his attempts to include them failed.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"29891, 28624, 26798, 25735, 24796, 24596, 19011, 18008, 18121, 16921, 16769, 16636, 16668, 16117, 16023, 15402, 14513, 14455, 15735, 14337, 14500, 15267, 14318, 14322, 14307, 14310, 14313, 14315, 15168, 14108, 14180, 14621, 13991, 13904, 15036, 13752, 13576, 12909, 12880","repeated_count":"39","date":"10/21/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
