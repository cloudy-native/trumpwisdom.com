The CIA concluded in 2016 that Russia intervened in the U.S. presidential election to help elect Trump, an assessment backed up by FBI Director James B. Comey and then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. On Jan. 6, the intelligence community released a declassified report expressing \"high confidence\" in this judgement. Senate and House committees led by Republicans have begun their own investigations, and at least one Republican lawmaker has called for the appointment of a special prosecutor.
