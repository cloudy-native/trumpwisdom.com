Thank you!”","analysis":"This claim is doubly false. Trump's overall approval rating consistently hovers in the low 40s and his disapproval rating is higher in reputable polls. A Gallup poll from June 2018 found that 90 percent of Republicans approved of Trump’s performance. But that doesn't make him the most popular Republican president in history. George W. Bush maintained an approval rating close to 99 percent of Republicans during his first term after the Sept. 11 attacks. President George H.W. Bush reached a high of 97 percent in 1991 after the successful conclusion of the Persian Gulf War. Ronald Reagan hit a high of 94 percent at the end of 1984, Richard Nixon a high of 91 percent in 1973 and Dwight Eisenhower a high of 95 percent in 1956. A Washington Post-ABC News poll in October found that Trump’s approval among Republicans had fallen to 74 percent.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Biographical record","repeated_ids":"27050, 25623, 25135, 24145, 21528, 22978, 21382, 22629, 22578, 20902, 20632, 20471, 20531, 19993, 19985, 20140, 20128, 19856, 19745, 18924, 18961, 19695, 18914, 18896, 18931, 18677, 18507, 18511, 17115, 18370, 16915, 18228, 16697, 16408, 16138, 16168, 16059, 16245, 15864, 15922, 15018, 14491, 15796, 15773, 14756, 14747, 15758, 15650, 14150, 14321, 14157, 15483, 14314, 14071, 15161, 14269, 14216, 13937, 13495, 13477, 13381, 12716, 12774, 12617, 12916, 12512, 12353, 12036, 10821, 10822, 9178, 8813, 8532, 7949, 6694, 6301, 4639, 4649, 4496, 4235, 3899, 3652, 3648","repeated_count":"83","date":"01/11/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
