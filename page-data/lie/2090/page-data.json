The program is only open to those born after June 15, 1981, so DACA recipients can be no more than 36 years old. On average, they are 25 years old.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"2168","repeated_count":"1","date":"01/09/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
