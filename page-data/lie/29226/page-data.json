It's Democrat. Doesn't sound as good. That's why I use it all the time. No, it should be the Democratic. They should change their name. It sounds nicer. I hate to even say it -- but the Democrat Convention, when the Pledge of Allegiance, they took the word God out, and I heard it. I said, 'Oh,' you know that. I heard it. I said, 'Oh, they must have made a mistake. They had a typo, maybe. We'll call it a typo,' and then I heard it a second time, and, uh, and I think, by the way, God is looking at us and saying, \"We want to give you a nice, cool day today.\" Because, that wind, I don't know about you, but that wind is hitting me hard.”","analysis":"Actually, the pledge was recited in full each night of the convention. The words “under God” were omitted at the start of daytime meetings for two caucuses, though.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"29226, 29975, 28588, 28090, 27907, 26227, 25532, 25276, 25777, 24113","repeated_count":"10","date":"11/01/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
