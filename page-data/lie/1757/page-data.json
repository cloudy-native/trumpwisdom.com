The Washington Post {reported}: \"The sunglasses in the Louis Vuitton store in Hangzhou are priced at or around 4,900 yuan ($750). According to Chinese law, anyone stealing goods worth between 4,000 and 7,000 yuan faces between one and two years in jail, although the sentence can be mitigated if they confess, show remorse and pay compensation.\" Generally, foreigners do not endure jail time in China for such an offense.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"1730","repeated_count":"1","date":"11/19/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
