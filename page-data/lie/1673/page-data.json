So I think it's going to be a number over $4 trillion.”","analysis":"Trump keeps inflating the amount of money held overseas by U.S. companies. He once estimated there was $3 trillion, and here he says \"at least $4 trillion.\" But there are no official, current numbers on the profits held overseas by U.S. companies, just estimates. The White House would not respond to a query on where Trump is getting these numbers, but his high-end figure appears to be an exaggeration. The Internal Revenue Service in 2012 said the figure was $2.3 trillion, and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that it had risen to $2.6 trillion in 2015. There are other estimates as well, but none top $2.8 trillion.","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"4324, 4241, 3683, 3870, 2313, 2229, 2332, 2030, 2044, 1818, 1767, 1884, 1719, 1673, 1669, 1561, 1610, 1623, 1536, 1430, 1415, 1454, 1410, 1523, 1358, 1310, 1215, 1133, 1144, 1109, 1110","repeated_count":"31","date":"11/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
