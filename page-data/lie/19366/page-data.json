And they lost every one of them because they came and they dropped the whole pile of ballots on the table.”","analysis":"Trump spins another election-fraud fantasy here. Democrats in 2018 won seven seats in Orange County, California, receiving a boost from votes tabulated after election day, predominantly from absentee and provisional ballots. California always takes a long time to count its mail-in ballots, and the results sometimes change the results in elections that were close on election night. California allows non-family members to submit other people's vote-by-mail ballots, what Trump calls \"harvesting.\" But there are careful checks in place to prevent fraud, such as verifying that the signature on a ballot matches that of the registered voter. There is no evidence any fraud was committed in those elections. Republicans in California have admitted they had not taken advantage of \"harvesting\" as much as Democrats in the state and are stepping up efforts to close the gap.
