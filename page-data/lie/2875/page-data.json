Everybody said, ‘Oh, he was so tough,’ and I used the word ‘rape.’ And yesterday, it came out where, this journey coming up, women are raped at levels that nobody has ever seen before. They don’t want to mention that.”","analysis":"Trump was referring to rape allegations within a caravan of Central Americans that was heading to the United States. There are two problems with this statement. First, Trump is harking back to 2015, when he announced his presidential candidacy in Trump Tower. He claimed at the time, “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. … They’re rapists.” But the caravaners are Central Americans, so these rape allegations do not prove his point about Mexicans. Furthermore, the rape allegations themselves are a matter of dispute.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
