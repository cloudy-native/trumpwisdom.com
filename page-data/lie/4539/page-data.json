How about that? Somebody comes in, he brings his mother, and his father, and his aunt and uncle, 15 times removed. He brings them all. … But this guy had 22 people come in with him -- 22 people.

It'll take forever.”","analysis":"This is rich, considering Trump's mother- and father-in-law recently gained U.S. citizenship through \"chain migration.\" Trump previously has touted a figure of 23 people being brought in through \"chain migration\" by 29-year-old terror suspect Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov. But no agency has confirmed this figure and experts say it is implausible because Saipov only had a green card, meaning he could only bring in his wife (already in the U.S.) or his minor children (already U.S. citizens).","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"25357, 8854, 8326, 7821, 7052, 6235, 6388, 6411, 6485, 5902, 4539, 4287, 4527, 3264, 2878, 2384, 2299, 2077, 2063, 2064","repeated_count":"20","date":"08/04/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
