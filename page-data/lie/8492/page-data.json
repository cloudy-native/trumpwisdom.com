But the reasons are varied and may not be as serious in some cases as Trump implies. Moreover, nearly 2,000 migrants a day are encountered at the southern border on average. Referring 50 cases (2.5 percent) to medical providers for any conceivable medical reason is not a crisis rate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
