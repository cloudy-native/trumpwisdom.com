By any available measure, there is no new security crisis at the border. Apprehensions of people trying to cross the southern border peaked most recently at 1.6 million in 2000 and have been in decline since, falling to just under 400,000 in fiscal 2018. The decline is partly because of technology upgrades; tougher penalties in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks; a decline in migration rates from Mexico; and a sharp increase in the number of Border Patrol officers. The fiscal 2018 number was up from just over 300,000 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border for fiscal 2017, the lowest level in more than 45 years. There are far more cases of travelers overstaying their visas than southern border apprehensions. In fiscal 2017, the Department of Homeland Security reported 606,926 suspected in-country overstays, or twice the number of southern border apprehensions. In fiscal 2016, U.S. officials reported 408,870 southern border apprehensions and 544,676 suspected in-country overstays.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"29853, 27893, 27632, 27322, 25463, 25353, 22852, 22719, 14874, 14649, 13693, 10584, 9908, 9950, 9767, 9773, 9449, 9273, 9262, 9042, 8970, 8934, 8823, 8772, 8781, 8699, 8550, 8563, 8587, 8406, 8481, 8485, 8503, 8355, 8367, 8511, 8514, 8288, 8289, 8268, 8278, 8260, 8057, 7780, 7783, 8152, 8157, 8190, 8206, 8231, 8241, 8251, 8257, 8096, 8103, 8243, 7768, 8245, 8220, 7877, 7878, 7883, 7885, 7899, 7909, 7948, 7845, 7846, 7864","repeated_count":"69","date":"03/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
