It is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have... .....its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY! Therefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020. We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately. Thank you!”","analysis":"Trump's claims about \"no profit\" and \"zero cost\" should be taken with a grain of salt, considering that he does not release his tax returns or Trump Organization financial statements to the public and admitted in legal proceedings before he was president that he employs guesswork and boasts when giving estimates.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
