Let people put their ballots in earlier. But you have to have -- you have to have numbers. You can't have these things delayed for many days and maybe weeks, you can't do that. The whole world is waiting. This country is waiting, but the whole world is waiting. And a lot of shenanigans, a lot of bad things happen with ballots when you say let's devote days and days, and all of a sudden the ballot count changes. And you take a look at Philadelphia, the history of Philadelphia politics. No, I don't put people on their honor code. I don't think it's right. And I think it's a very dangerous thing that they've done with that decision and maybe their wisdom will change that decision or maybe we'll go back and give them a right to change it. But that's a terrible -- it's a very dangerous decision for this country, what they did with Pennsylvania and some others also. You have to have a date, and the date happens to be November 3, and we should be entitled to know who won on November 3. And if somebody comes along and puts a ballot in way late, they shouldn't be, they should put the ballot in earlier. There's no reason why they can't put the ballot in two weeks early or one week earlier. I think it's a very dangerous decision for our country -- in many ways, dangerous, in many ways. Yeah.”","analysis":"There is no legal requirement that mandates the immediate reporting of all election results in the country; delayed counting is unavoidable when so many people are avoiding election lines during the pandemic. Plenty of presidential elections have remained unsettled on election night, some for days or weeks. Trump baselessly suggests Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, and officials in the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia will manipulate the vote count, laying the groundwork for his many unsuccessful challenges to contest his loss in the state.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
