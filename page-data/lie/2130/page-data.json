The picture is murkier if he were referring only to small businesses, as the White House claims. The law was not intended to target community banks, and it carved out many exemptions. But regulatory oversight appears to have become tougher, so a case could be made that the post-Dodd-Frank regulatory environment made it harder for community banks to make small-business loans.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"0049","repeated_count":"1","date":"01/16/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
