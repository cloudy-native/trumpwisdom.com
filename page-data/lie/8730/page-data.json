You know, a lot of problems. A lot of problems....They want to take away your car, reduce the value of your home, and put millions of Americans out of work, spend $100 trillion, which by the way, there's no such thing as $100 trillion, you have to spend $100 trillion -- And remember this, no other country except us is going to do it. That's a little problem, too.”","analysis":"Trump is misrepresenting the Green New Deal as the plan is currently written.
