Also, why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems, some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary, others, including himself, have worked for Obama....And why isn’t Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity & real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta, Dossier?”","analysis":"Trump ignores the fact that Mueller is a Republican and was appointed by his administration. Trump is referring to the team of lawyers that Mueller has assembled. Eleven out of 16 attorneys on Mueller's team made public so far have contributed to Democrats, including Clinton and Obama. The other five have no record of political contributions, though the Daily Caller says 13 are registered Democrats. One attorney who donated the maximum amount represented the Clinton Foundation in a 2015 lawsuit. Another attorney without a record of political donations represented a Clinton aide at one point. Both attorneys worked for WilmerHale, a firm that also represents Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, as well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Moreover, under federal law, Mueller is not allowed to consider the political leanings of his staff when hiring them. Trump suggests that Mueller, a Republican, worked for Obama for 8 years but that's not true; moreover, he was appointed FBI director by George W. Bush. The \"nasty\" business relationship apparently refers to a private dispute with Mueller over dues at Trump's golf club in Sterling, Va.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/29/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
