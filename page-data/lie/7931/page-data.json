Many, many, many times what those soldiers cost that country.”","analysis":"In Trump’s transactional view of the world, countries that he believes are doing better in one sphere (such as trade or receiving foreign aid) must pony up to settle accounts elsewhere. So, even though the United States is a large country with the most powerful military in the world, he mocks much smaller nations for contributing 100 or 200 soldiers to wars led by Americans. Many of those contributions are indicative of political support for U.S. goals, a diplomatic achievement that previous administrations have touted as important. The initial invasion of Iraq was largely a U.S.-British effort, but the Bush administration worked hard to persuade countries as small as Albania (1,340 troops over five years), Estonia (240 troops over six years) and Mongolia (1,128 troops over five years) to contribute to the post-invasion force. The United Kingdom had more than 450 soldiers killed in Afghanistan, including more than 400 in hostile action.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
