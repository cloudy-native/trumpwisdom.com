The charge is that Comey lied at a Senate hearing when asked whether he \"authorized\" anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source about the Hillary Clinton email investigation in 2016. Comey said no. McCabe later on in a statement said he had spoken to a reporter anonymously and noted that Comey was \"aware of the interaction.\" That doesn't prove Comey lied to Congress, though the case can be made that he should have been more forthcoming in the Senate hearing. Here's the central issue: McCabe already had authority to speak with the reporter and did not need Comey's authorization. Comey was not asked whether he was aware of the leak but whether he had approved it.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
