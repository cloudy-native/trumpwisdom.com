Projecting American power is not mainly about seeking repayment for services rendered. Most U.S. military officials would disagree strongly that the U.S. gets nothing out of leadership in Middle East; they would point to benefits such as unimpeded naval commerce, a lessened threat of terrorism, stronger local security forces and regional pressure to improve human rights performance.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/20/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
