And we have thousands of people that have asked for that, thousands and thousands of people. So many people asked when I was on the campaign, I don't have any relationship, but they said when you can, president, we would love our son to be brought back home -- you know, the remains.”","analysis":"It is all but impossible for Trump to have had such conversations during the campaign — at least as often as he claims. He's frequently suggested that he had conversations with parents of Korean war dead, but a parent of a son who served in the Korean war would likely be well more than 100 years old. Assuming that the average age of mothers of service members born in 1934 was between 20 and 29, such mothers would have been between 102 and 111 years old during the 2016 campaign.\nFifty-five sets of skeletal remains were given to the U.S. military after the first Trump-Kim summit, but the Pentagon later abandoned efforts to work with North Korea on the issue, saying it had been unable to coordinate with the North Korean army regarding any resumption of joint recovery operations.
