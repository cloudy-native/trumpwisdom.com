He said in an interview with Fox News on Jan. 27 that NATO allies will have added $100 billion extra toward defense by the end of 2020. (The estimate later became $130 billion, in 2015 dollars, over 2016 spending.) But the effort to push NATO members to spend more on defense began well before Trump took office; it was not going down, as Trump frequently claims. At the 2014 NATO summit in Wales, after Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine, the Obama administration secured an agreement by member nations to aim to increase their spending on defense to 2 percent of each nation’s gross domestic product within 10 years. In any case, the money would not be going to the United States or even necessarily to NATO; this is money that countries would spend to bolster their own military, which in turn supports all of NATO.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"22894, 21863, 22800, 22744, 22680, 20561, 19704, 17336, 16131, 14590, 15786, 15005, 15026, 14001, 13919, 13617, 13565, 12703, 12564, 12394, 11563, 12100, 11986, 11460, 11836, 11215, 11761, 11121, 10908, 10910, 10697, 10478, 10552, 10897, 10349, 9877, 9636, 9640, 9285, 9027, 8997, 8635, 6407, 4587","repeated_count":"44","date":"06/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
