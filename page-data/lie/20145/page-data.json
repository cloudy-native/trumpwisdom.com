Kim Jong Un, who we were getting along with very well, went 'ballistic', just like his missiles - and rightfully so He didn't want Bolton anywhere near him. Bolton’s dumbest of all statements set us back very badly with North Korea, even now. I asked him, 'what the hell were you thinking?' He had no answer and just apologized. That was early on, I should have fired him right then & there!”","analysis":"In the nonproliferation world, the \"Libya model\" refers to how quickly and completely the country dismantled its nuclear program after reaching a deal with the United Kingdom and the United States in 2003. Bolton, in his book \"The Room Where It Happened,\" says that after Trump complained about Bolton's use of the term, he explained this to Trump. But Trump consistently misunderstood and thought it referred to the overthrow of Moammar Gaddafi during the Arab Spring. \"I  tried  explaining  that  the  'model'  for  nonproliferation  analysts  was completely  removing  Libya’s  nuclear  program,  not  Qaddafi’s  subsequent unpredictable  demise,\" Bolton wrote. \"History  showed  that  I  didn't  get  through. Trump  failed  to  understand  that the  unforeseen  Arab  Spring,  which  swept  dramatically  through  the  region beginning  in  2011,  was  the  reason  for  Gaddafi’s  subsequent  downfall,  not his  2003  renunciation  of  nuclear  weapons. \" Bolton says that Trump ended their conversation on the matter by declaring \"good job!\" Then, ironically, Trump later told a news conference that the \"Libya model\" meant  the  “total  decimation”  of  Libya. Trump added: “Now,  that  model  would  take  place [with  North  Korea]  if  we  don't  make  a deal, most likely.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
