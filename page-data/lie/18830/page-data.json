Number one at Harvard Law School, or very close to number one. And they're bothered because he's having somebody walk his dog, is you're telling me? I didn't know that. I didn't hear that. I didn't know about an investigation. But this is what you get with the Democrats. Here's a man supposed to be negotiating war and peace with major, major countries, with weaponry like the world has never seen before. And the Democrats and the fake news media -- they're interested in a man who is walking their dog. And maybe he's busy and maybe he's negotiating with Kim Jong Un -- okay? -- about nuclear weapons, so that he'd say, 'Please, could you walk my dog? Do you mind walking my dog? I'm talking to Kim Jong Un.' Or 'I'm talking to President Xi about paying us for some of the damage they've caused to the world and to us. Please walk my dog.' To who? A Secret Service person or somebody, right? I don't know. I think this country has a long way to go. They -- the priorities are really screwed up when I read this.”","analysis":"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did rank first at West Point and was one of the editors of the Harvard Law Review, but Harvard does not rank students. Trump offers a long defense here of Pompeo, who was supposedly under investigation for having federal employees do household errands. But his comments ignore the fact that it considered inappropriate for a political appointee or any senior official to have employees do household errands if that is not part of their job description.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
