I mean they were surveilling my campaign. If that happened on the other foot, they would’ve considered that treasonous. They would’ve considered that spying at the highest level.”","analysis":"It has been reported that an FBI informant in Europe, a professor named Stefan Halper, met with at least three people working on the Trump campaign in Europe. So far, there has been nothing to indicate whether there was a political agenda or a “spy” mandate as part of Halper's assistance for the FBI, which started after the agency opened a counterintelligence probe. The documents for the FISA warrant on Carter Page (who was no longer a Trump staffer when they were issued) have already been released.
