They mailed it in. And actually, the Democrats saw they were losing and, all of a sudden, they threw voter booths up in certain Democrat areas.

Democrats had raised concerns that Lancaster, which has a large African-American population, didn’t have an in-person voting place, arguing it disenfranchised voters who were more likely to vote in person on Election Day.

In the state legislature, Lancaster is represented by two Republicans, and the mayor, Rex Parris, is a Republican.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/21/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
