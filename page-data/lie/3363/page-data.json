Over the last couple of years, and over the last many years -- but over the last couple of years, this country has lost $800 billion on trade with other countries, the biggest one being China. Eight-hundred billion dollars.”","analysis":"The U.S. trade deficit in 2017 was $566 billion, according to the Commerce Department. Trump gets his $800 billion number by looking only at the deficit for trade in goods ($810 billion) even though U.S. trade in services runs a substantial surplus of $244 billion. Trump regularly complains about the trade deficit with China, saying it is $500 billion. But it was $310 billion in 2016. The goods deficit in 2017 was $375 billion, but that will be lower when the trade in services figure is calculated. Moreover, countries do not win or \"lose\" money on trade deficits.
