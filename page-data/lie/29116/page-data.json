Any Delphi people here? Are you Delphi? Where's Delphi? Aw, I tell you, you -- I guarantee you they're voting for Trump, right? Right? They threw these people under the bus. And days ago I signed an order to restore the pensions and all of the other things for workers, not only Delphi, in Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan who were treated very unfairly, right?”","analysis":"Twelve days before the election, Trump suddenly showed interest in a subject that had attracted little of his attention during his presidency -- a long-ago dispute over the pensions of salaried workers at a former General Motors auto parts unit known as Delphi Corp. As usual, he exaggerates what happened -- some pensions were significantly reduced but they were not \"totally wiped out.\" Obama and Biden had no direct role but the decision to treat non-union workers differently was made by GM with the close consultation of Treasury Department officials during a 2009 auto industry bailout, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sigtarp.gov/Audit%20Reports/SIGTARP_Delphi_Report.pdf\">according to a 2013 government report</a>. \"Treasury’s Auto Team and GM did not agree to top up the pensions of other former GM employees at Delphi, which did not have active employees at GM, and therefore had no leverage to hold up GM’s bankruptcy,\" the report noted. Trump bragged about signing a memo ordering officials to address the reductions, but Reuters <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-delphi-trump/trump-orders-review-of-auto-parts-firm-pension-cuts-idUSKBN2772VC\">reported</a> it \"stops short of any specific plan to restore the pension cuts of Delphi salaried retirees, who experienced reductions of up to 70%.\" In other words, Trump was only pretending to suggest he would help these workers. In September, a U.S. appeals court had rejected a lawsuit by Delphi salaried retirees over the pension reductions made by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.
