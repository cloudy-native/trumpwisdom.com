That's a big thing. Thirteen percent of companies will be leaving China in the fairly near future. … And we'll see what happens. But China has lost a lot of companies. A lot of companies.”","analysis":"This is misleading. Foreign direct investment in China has continued to grow amid Trump's trade war. The survey Trump is referencing says 13 percent of companies polled by the U.S.-China Business Council -- not all companies in China -- had moved or were planning to move away. That rate is fairly standard, looking at survey results from the last five years. Moreover, foreign companies continue to invest in China, so the departures are being offset, which Trump doesn't acknowledge.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/30/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
