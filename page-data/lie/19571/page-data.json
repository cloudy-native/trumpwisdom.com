They said, 'Don't ban China; it's gonna blow over.' And they said this at the end of February, you know, they were saying this at the end of February. In January, at the end of January, I banned people from China coming into the United States except for American citizens coming back, which you have to let them back but we let them back very carefully. Nobody ever did that before. Do you know it's the first time it's ever been done. And I had a room of 20 people, approximately in the Oval Office. I was the only one that wanted to do it. And we had professionals, we had doctors, David, I was the only one that wanted to do it. And if I didn't do that Dr. Fauci said this, we would have lost thousands and thousands, tens of thousands more lives, but I banned China which is the primary source from coming in.”","analysis":"False. Fauci never said it would \"blow over,\" and in fact was warning consistently about long-term risks from the covid-19 outbreak. Trump is also giving a false account of the decision-making process that led to his Jan. 31 ban on foreign travelers from China. Although Fauci and other public health advisers initially opposed the travel restrictions, they ended up endorsing them before Trump. At a news briefing Feb. 7, Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, said the travel restrictions “were the uniform recommendation of the career public health officials here at HHS,” specifically naming Fauci and Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “This was their considered recommendation, which I and the president adopted,” Azar said.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
