And others had tried and failed. And they didn't try too hard because they know it couldn't be done, but we got it done. This law rolls back provisions of the really terrible 1994 criminal -- Clinton crime law that disproportionately impacted the African American community. I mean, they liked Clinton, but they passed a law that was a disaster.”","analysis":"Trump signed the First Step Act, a comprehensive criminal justice overhaul that generally reduces sentences for crack cocaine offenders. The law builds on President Obama's sentencing overhaul in 2010, which also reduced sentences for crack offenses. It wasn't an all-Trump production, as he claims. The sentencing disparity actually originated in a 1986 law, not the 1994 crime bill.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
