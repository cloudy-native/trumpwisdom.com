Since he imposed tariffs on steel, the president has repeatedly claimed that U.S. Steel was building new steel plants. Depending on his mood, the number has ranged from six to nine plants. But U.S. Steel made no such announcement. It merely stated that it would restart two blast furnaces at the company’s Granite City Works integrated plant in Illinois — one in March and the other in October, for a total of 800 jobs. The company in August also said it would upgrade a plant in Gary, Ind., but without creating any new jobs. As for Nucor, it is investing $650 million to expand flat-rolled steel production capacity at its Gallatin sheet mill in Ghent, Kentucky. It's not a new plant.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"12292, 9978, 8573, 6793, 6773, 7062, 6578, 6280, 5877, 5401, 5587, 5386, 5265, 5709, 4792, 4848, 4707, 4603, 4710, 4487, 4652, 4315, 4550, 4293, 4515, 4234, 3711, 3717, 3767, 4081, 3593, 3833, 3560, 4061, 3559, 3989, 4019, 4028, 3553, 3493","repeated_count":"40","date":"01/31/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
