In fact, they were acting like they already knew what the outcome was going to be. They had it covered. And perhaps they did, very sadly for our country.”","analysis":"Trump baselessly suggests, without evidence, that the Democrats had in place a massive vote-fraud operation so sophisticated that Biden did not even have to campaign.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
