It’s like a nation is occupying your country.”","analysis":"It's a huge exaggeration to say ICE is \"liberating towns,\" as though they were occupied by an invading foreign power. MS-13 is active in prisons and in a few areas such as Los Angeles, Long Island and the D.C. region. Experts say Trump exaggerates the threat posed by the gang.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
