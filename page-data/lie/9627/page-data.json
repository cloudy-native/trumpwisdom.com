Special counsel Robert Mueller decided not to bring charges on illegal coordination or conspiracy, but he documented numerous contacts between Trump campaign members and Russian individuals. Mueller also declined to reach a decision on whether Trump obstructed justice.

Mueller did not bring charges but his report casts Trump in a damning light.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
