You don't have borders, you don't have a country. We don't want drug traffickers, or human traffickers, or illegal people with criminal records, to come in. Our Border Patrol, our ICE agents, our military -- we've done great. But you can never do it perfectly unless you have a wall.”","analysis":"Most drugs are smuggled in through legal ports of entry, and those entryways would still exist if Trump's wall were built. Trump exaggerates the link between immigration and crime; almost all research shows legal and illegal immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population. Any wall would be built a mile or so inland from the border. Many of the families attempting to immigrate from Central America are seeking asylum. To petition for asylum, a person needs to be on U.S. soil under current law. So in theory, immigrants could cross the border and file a legally valid petition for asylum before reaching Trump's wall. The incentive would still exist.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31475, 21854, 21391, 21437, 19398, 19152, 18027, 16849, 12684, 11032, 10489, 10262, 10098, 9897, 9778, 9811, 9611, 9240, 8971, 8983, 8937, 8820, 8845, 8794, 8747, 8448, 8531, 8482, 8491, 8506, 8386, 8023, 7789, 7795, 8234, 8242, 8248, 8039, 8093, 7769, 8071, 7755, 7975, 7954, 7858, 7712, 7697, 7702, 7681, 7684, 7653, 7656, 7480, 7575, 7264, 7119, 7156, 6811, 6906, 6601, 6766, 7082, 5472, 4581, 3451, 3490, 3845, 3175, 2834, 2748, 2641, 2630, 2922, 2598, 2652, 2411, 2335, 2099, 2121, 2056, 2066, 2052, 2094, 2103, 1998, 2000, 2004, 1994, 1952, 1775, 1572, 1407, 1414, 1458, 1449, 1478, 1395, 1194, 1138, 1137, 1034, 1136","repeated_count":"102","date":"12/31/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
