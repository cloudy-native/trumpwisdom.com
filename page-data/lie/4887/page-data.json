First in his class at Oxford.”","analysis":"Gorsuch graduated from Harvard Law School cum laude, which is an honors designation but below magna cum laude and summa cum laude. Very few students earn summa cum laude, the next 10 percent earn magna cum laude and the next 30 percent earn cum laude. So Gorsuch was in the top 40 percent of Harvard law school graduates. Michelle Deakin, a Harvard Law spokeswoman, confirmed he did not graduate first. He earned a DPhil at Oxford and doctorate students generally are not ranked.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"5475, 4989, 4887, 4540, 0437","repeated_count":"5","date":"09/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
