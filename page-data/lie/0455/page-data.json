Tremendous disadvantage.”","analysis":"Trump certainly deserves credit for breaching the so-called “blue wall” — the Midwestern states that have backed Democrats in recent years. But Republicans have an advantage because they have an edge in small, rural states, which in the electoral college system requires fewer votes per elector. In Wyoming, for instance, there are 143,000 people for each electoral vote, compared to 500,000 in a state like California. Since Democrats tend to concentrate in large cities, the impact of those votes is dissipated. This is one reason that in two recent elections — 2000 and 2016 — the Democrat won the popular vote but lost the electoral college.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"0579, 0427","repeated_count":"2","date":"04/28/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
