This machine was set at the lowest level. According to one report, in order to test the process, nine voters in Clark County cast ballots with intentionally incorrect signatures, and eight of the nine ballots were accepted and counted. They said you could sign your name as Santa Claus, and it would be accepted. Last week, the Clark County commission threw out the results of a local election after the registrar reported finding, quote, 'discrepancies that we can't explain.' Also in Nevada, some voters were entered into a raffle for more than a dozen gift cards worth as much as $250 if they could prove they had voted. This took place on Indian reservations.”","analysis":"This is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/28/donald-trump/trumps-misleading-claim-about-ballot-signatures-ne/\">false</a>.
