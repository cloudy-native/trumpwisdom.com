Roger Stone was treated very unfairly. Roger Stone was brought into this witch hunt, this whole political witch hunt and the Mueller scam -- it's a scam, because it's been proven false. And he was treated very unfairly, just like General Flynn was treated unfairly; just like Papadopoulos was treated unfairly. They've all been treated unfairly.”","analysis":"Roger Stone has been a Trump political adviser for years and had a role in Trump's campaign until mid-2015. Both the trial judge and Trump's own Justice Department said Stone committed serious crimes and deserved to spend time in prison. He was convicted of repeatedly lying to Congress and witness tampering, which impeded congressional investigations into Russia's 2016 election interference. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said at Stone's sentencing: \"He was not prosecuted, as some have complained, for standing up for the president. He was prosecuted for covering up for the president.\" The Justice Department said, in a sentencing memo, Stone “committed serious offenses and deserves a sentence of incarceration that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25180, 20859, 20897, 20852, 20731, 20752, 20505","repeated_count":"7","date":"07/11/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
