So many people asked when I was on the campaign and I’d say wait a minute I don't have any relationship but they said when you can president we’d love our son to be brought back home. You know, the remains.”","analysis":"We are dubious that Trump had such conversations with \"so many people,\" let alone thousands. A parent of a son served in the Korean war would likely be above the age of 100. Assuming that the average age of the mothers of service members born in 1934 was between 20 and 29, then, gives us a birth year of 1905 to 1914, or between 102 and 111 years old during the 2016 election.
