In fact, he said he would have said so if the evidence had shown that. Mueller said his investigation concluded there was “insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy” between the Russians who sought to influence the election and the Trump campaign. But he did not clear Trump on obstruction of justice. “If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,” Mueller said. “We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"05/30/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
