Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and the right-wing Federalist publication, which does not disclose who funds it, have suggested fraud is afoot in Michigan because of a clerical error that was quickly corrected.\n\nData from Decision Desk HQ, which fed some news organizations’ interactive maps, showed that Biden received a 140,000-vote bump in a single update out of Michigan while Trump got nothing. That does seem fishy, but rather than investigate, Trump, Cruz, the Federalist and some Republicans immediately raised the specter of fraud.\n\nWhat happened? A typo.\n\n“This morning there was a clerical error in the Shiawassee, MI county presidential data,” Decision Desk HQ wrote on Twitter. “Once we identified the error, we cleared the erroneous data and updated it with the correct data as provided by officials.” When Shiawassee County officials <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/11/clerical-error-prompts-unfounded-claims-about-michigan-results/\">reported vote totals</a>, a clerk added an extra 0 to Biden’s numbers, turning 15,371 into 153,710. The typo was corrected within an hour.\n\nTrump’s tweet quoted another from GOP consultant Matt Mackowiak. But Mackowiak later <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MattMackowiak/status/1324041161321992192?s=20\">corrected himself</a>. Trump did not.
