They're tackling people. And then, of course, they have catch and release. You catch somebody. ‘Who is this person?’ ‘It's a criminal.’ ‘Oh, that's OK. Catch, take his name and release the person.’ And the person they think will come back to court. We have the dumbest immigration laws in the whole world.”","analysis":"Catch and release is a collection of policies, court precedents, executive actions and federal statutes spanning more than 20 years, cobbled together throughout Democratic and Republican administrations, including Trump's own. It primarily applies to asylum seekers and children. It takes some mental hoop jumping to imagine the situation that Trump is suggesting. A criminal record would make an immigrant ineligible for asylum, and U.S. officials would not release such immigrants wittingly. The Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for tighter border controls, found in a 2017 report that “over the past 20 years, 37 percent of all aliens free pending their trials — 918,098 out of 2,498,375 — never showed for court.” That means 63 percent did show up.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"26946, 26835, 26671, 27144, 26210, 26327, 25697, 25568, 25438, 25356, 24434, 24097, 23680, 21591, 22455, 18863, 17785, 16549, 16205, 16476, 16347, 14676, 12687, 11639, 11954, 11939, 11899, 11850, 11141, 11719, 10877, 10263, 10006, 9890, 9645, 9705, 9536, 9297, 9140, 9141, 8852, 8451, 8498, 8324, 8280, 8167, 8195, 8216, 8217, 8223, 7891, 7893, 7910, 7911, 7912, 7148, 7077, 7078, 7079, 7081, 6537, 6557, 6644, 6202, 6386, 6161, 6425, 6486, 5899, 5818, 4401, 4288, 4525, 3892, 3460, 3847, 3945, 3955, 3917, 3936, 3318, 3270, 3202, 3172, 3122, 3083, 2816, 2829, 2695","repeated_count":"89","date":"10/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
