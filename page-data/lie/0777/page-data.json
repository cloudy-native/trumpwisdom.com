Health costs for employer-provided plans have grown much slower than expected since the Affordable Care Act was implemented. Experts debate whether the ACA played a significant role, but the average family premium is now almost $3,600 lower than if premium growth had kept pace with the rate in the decade before the law was passed, {according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.} The $3,000 figure in Trump's statement comes from dubious HHS report.
