They love to rule against me. I picked three people. I fought like hell for them. One in particular I fought. They all said, 'Sir, cut him loose.' He's killing the senators, you know, very loyal senators, they're very loyal people, 'Sir, cut him loose, he's killing us, sir, cut him loose.' I must have gotten half of the senators. I said, 'No, I can't do that, it's unfair to him and it's unfair to the family. He didn't do anything wrong.' They made up stories, they're all made-up stories. He didn't do anything wrong. Cut him loose, sir. I said, 'No, I won't do that. We got him through.' And you know what, they couldn't give a damn. They couldn't give a damn. Let him rule the right way, but it almost seems that they're all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country, to hurt our country....The Supreme Court, they rule against me so much.","analysis":"There is little evidence that half of the GOP senators urged Trump to drop Brett Kavanaugh when his nomination to the Supreme Court was stalled because of a sexual abuse allegation. The nominations for his two other nominees proceeded relatively smoothly in the GOP-controlled Senate. There is no evidence that members of the Supreme Court \"love to rule against\" Trump. He has a pretty good track record in case brought before the court, with some high-profile losses -- like many presidents. He then maligns the court by claiming they are purposely trying to hurt the country by not entertaining his bogus claims of election fraud.
