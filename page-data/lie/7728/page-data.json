The first U.S. airstrikes in Syria were in Sept. 2014 and the first deployment of 50 special ops forces was October 2015 (though the CIA may have been operating in Syria as early as 2013). The civil war in Syria only started in March 2011, less than eight years ago.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"14293, 14345, 14093, 14205, 13973, 13916, 13950, 13869, 13581, 13511, 13561, 13624, 8458, 8084, 7902, 7847, 7727, 7728","repeated_count":"18","date":"12/26/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
