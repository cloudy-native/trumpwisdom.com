Not even a little tiny crime. There was no crime whatsoever, and they know it.”","analysis":"Trump is wrong to suggest that a statutory crime is required for the House to bring impeachment charge.  The standard for conviction in an impeachment trial is not the same as the standard in the criminal justice system. The outcome of an impeachment trial relies largely on the senators' personal judgments, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://congressionalresearch.com/98-990/document.php?study=STANDARD+OF+PROOF+IN+SENATE+IMPEACHMENT+PROCEEDINGS\">as the Congressional Research Service has noted</a>. As Mueller's report says, there was evidence that the Trump campaign cooperated with Russians during the 2016 election, but not enough to bring conspiracy or illegal coordination charges. There was also significant evidence that Trump obstructed justice. Mueller said he declined to reach a decision on obstruction charges in part because of a Justice Department policy not to indict the sitting president and in part because he didn't want to get in the way of a potential impeachment process in Congress, among other reasons. It is worth recalling that one of the articles of impeachments approved against Richard Nixon involved his failure to respond to congressional subpoenas.
