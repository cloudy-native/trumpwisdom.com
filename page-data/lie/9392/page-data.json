You know that. You see it all over.”","analysis":"Trump often hypes the impact of his steel tariffs on the steel business. Steel companies were not practically out of business. U.S. Steel has restarted some blast furnaces and its profits and revenue initially went up, but steel stocks have plunged in recent months as worldwide steel prices have fallen, led by a decline in steel prices in China. Barron’s reports that of the 13 stocks in the steel subindex of the Standard & Poor’s 1500 composite, all but one are down year to date by an average of nearly 25 percent. Moreover, even with the domestic steel mills running at 80 percent capacity, the United States needs to import 30 million tons of steel, Barron’s said. Where would that steel come from? Currently, 50 percent comes from Canada, Brazil and South Korea. Mexico and Russia supply 9 percent each.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29780, 29347, 29493, 29749, 29123, 28074, 28325, 26632, 24774, 23474, 20989, 19323, 17936, 17109, 17286, 18151, 16197, 15437, 15830, 14939, 14020, 13773, 12291, 11631, 12041, 12199, 11458, 11800, 11026, 10579, 10941, 10314, 10288, 9977, 9990, 9755, 9666, 9392, 8872, 8847, 8572, 8508, 8068, 7969, 7977, 7397, 7421, 7017, 7441, 6789, 6938, 6973, 6792, 6771, 7061, 6576, 6279, 6284, 6122, 5400, 5586, 5613, 5263, 5784, 5652, 4791, 4589, 4703, 4604, 4711, 4414, 4278, 4570, 4533, 4560, 3764, 3447, 3448, 2791, 2496, 2499, 2467","repeated_count":"82","date":"03/20/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
