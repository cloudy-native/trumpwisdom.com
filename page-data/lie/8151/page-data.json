The decline is partly because of technology upgrades; tougher penalties in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks; a decline in migration rates from Mexico; and a sharp increase in the number of Border Patrol officers. The fiscal 2018 number was up from just over 300,000 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border for fiscal 2017, the lowest level in more than 45 years.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
