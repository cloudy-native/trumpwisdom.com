So they grab children at the border. They walk across. They get across easier if you have children. So they're just using the children. Then they tell them to get out of here.”","analysis":"According to DHS, the December total for border apprehensions of unaccompanied children and those with family members was 19,313. But it’s wrong to describe it as a statistic that represents children being smuggled into the country. Border officials screen for false claims of parentage. To imply as Trump does that a child’s mother, father or legal guardian is or hired a smuggler, coyote or gang member in all of these cases is wrong. The U.S. has some of the toughest immigration laws compared with other countries and they are a bipartisan collection of products.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
