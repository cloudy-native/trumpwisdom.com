You know, some of them we keep here when they -- it's very egregious. We don't necessarily trust other people to take care of justice, so we keep them here.”","analysis":"Many of the “criminal aliens” Trump is describing are immigrants who were convicted of immigration or nonviolent offenses. He quickly switched from the total for ICE arrests (120,000) to a different number that includes all the different charges. It’s a misleading, apples-and-oranges comparison because one individual may face multiple charges — and not all arrests result in convictions.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
