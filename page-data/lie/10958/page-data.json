Eleven out of 16 attorneys on Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team made public so far have contributed to Democrats, including Clinton and Obama. The other five have no record of political contributions, though the Daily Caller says 13 are registered Democrats. One attorney who donated the maximum amount represented the Clinton Foundation in a 2015 lawsuit. Another attorney without a record of political donations represented a Clinton aide at one point. Both attorneys worked for WilmerHale, a firm that also represents Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, as well as Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Moreover, under federal law, Mueller is not allowed to consider the political leanings of his staff when hiring them. While Trump frequently claims Mueller had a conflict because of a bitter dispute regarding membership fees in a Trump golf club in Virginia, the counsel's final report quotes from Mueller's resignation letter saying simply he was not using it enough.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"31003, 30831, 30773, 29795, 29880, 30462, 29206, 28070, 28181, 26949, 27044, 26237, 24571, 23432, 21342, 19846, 19620, 19628, 17297, 16927, 16677, 16464, 16311, 16013, 14770, 14175, 13517, 12950, 13399, 12854, 13678, 12996, 12771, 12650, 11582, 11653, 11654, 11533, 11352, 11556, 12135, 12151, 12070, 12236, 12030, 11979, 11449, 11479, 11834, 11858, 11865, 11162, 11167, 11775, 11818, 11113, 11009, 11730, 11733, 11096, 10814, 10800, 10740, 10788, 10965, 10727, 10662, 10675, 10676, 10714, 10776, 10780, 10439, 10958, 10589, 10593, 10653, 10772, 10414, 10571, 10572, 10937, 10390, 10535, 10543, 10851, 10383, 10357, 10332, 10342, 10346, 10289, 10123, 10125, 10207, 10094, 10157, 9876, 9962, 10115, 10020, 10023, 10072, 10058, 10064, 10065, 10066, 10067, 9747, 9756, 9999, 9903, 9969, 9848, 9933, 9961, 9827, 9741, 9792, 9658, 9495, 9561","repeated_count":"122","date":"05/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
