They're not going through where we have great Border Patrol officers and ICE officers, and military now. … They go right to the easiest part and the weakest part, sometimes out in desert.”","analysis":"CBP does seize vehicles at the border, though it's not clear how many cases involved attempts to cross undetected through the desert. There's no evidence such crossings happen with regularity. Authorities say a Mexican immigrant who was in the United States illegally killed a police officer in California. But there's no information about how or when he crossed the border. ICE said after the arrest that immigration officials had not come into contact with the suspect, Gustavo Perez Arriaga a/k/a Paulo Virgen Mendoza.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8821, 8567, 8592, 8487, 8487, 8495, 8504, 8505, 8382, 8292, 8274, 7803, 8010, 8007, 8130, 7794, 8189, 8202, 8229, 8246, 8246, 8250, 7762, 7762, 8004, 8077, 8092, 7970, 7971, 7979, 7980, 7999, 8209, 8219, 7960, 7880, 7861","repeated_count":"37","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
