With sanctuary cities, they're really not given that opportunity.”","analysis":"There’s no official definition of “sanctuary,” but it generally refers to rules restricting state and local governments from alerting federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. A handful of studies looked at whether there is a causation between sanctuary cities and crime. They either found no statistically significant impact of sanctuary policies on crime, or a reduction in crime due to immigrant-friendly policing strategies. Plus, although research is limited, it shows little difference in crime rates between cities that comply with ICE detainer requests and those that don't.
