William Evanina, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, released a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2139-statement-by-ncsc-director-william-evanina-election-threat-update-for-the-american-public\">statement</a> in August 2020 that reads in part: \"We assess that Russia is using a range of measures to primarily denigrate former Vice President Biden and what it sees as an anti-Russia 'establishment.' This is consistent with Moscow’s public criticism of him when he was Vice President for his role in the Obama Administration’s policies on Ukraine and its support for the anti-Putin opposition inside Russia. For example, pro-Russia Ukrainian parliamentarian Andriy Derkach is spreading claims about corruption – including through publicizing leaked phone calls – to undermine former Vice President Biden’s candidacy and the Democratic Party. Some Kremlin-linked actors are also seeking to boost President Trump’s candidacy on social media and Russian television.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
