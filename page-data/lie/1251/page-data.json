According to the National Taxpayer Advocate’s 2016 report, 54 percent of individual taxpayers pay preparers and about 40 percent of individual taxpayers use software that costs about $50 or more. Yet later during the speech, he made it sound as if the “professional help” is only referring to hired accountants: “That is why tax reform must dramatically simplify the tax code … and allow the vast majority of our citizens to file their taxes on a single, simple page without having to hire an accountant.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"1219, 1105","repeated_count":"2","date":"09/27/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
