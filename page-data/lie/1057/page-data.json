As a result, our hard-won gains slipped back into the hands of terrorist enemies. ... The vacuum we created by leaving too soon gave safe haven for ISIS to spread, to grow, recruit, and launch attacks. We cannot repeat in Afghanistan the mistake our leaders made in Iraq.”","analysis":"This is a flip-flop. Trump criticizes the 2011 withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq, blaming the previous administration for \"hastily and mistakenly\" withdrawing. But Trump supported rapid withdrawal as early as March 2007, saying the United States should “declare victory and leave.” So Trump criticizes Obama for taking action he advocated.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"1487, 1058","repeated_count":"2","date":"08/21/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
