I said, VERY EARLY ON, that it MAY EVEN hit Alabama. A BIG DIFFERENCE.... ...FAKE NEWS. I would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story, but the LameStream Media just won’t let it alone. They always have to have the last word, even though they know they are defrauding & deceiving the public. The public knows that the Media is corrupt!”","analysis":"The Times's Peter Baker is one of the most distinguished reporters covering the White House. By the time Trump made public comments warning that a storm could hit Alabama, forecasters had already ruled out that possibility. It is against the law to spread false weather reports.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/07/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
