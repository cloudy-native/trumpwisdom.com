And then I introduced a ban on Europe, very early again. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.”","analysis":"Trump oversells in the impact of his “travel ban” — and on Biden’s criticism.\n\nOn Jan. 31, the president announced that effective Feb. 2, non-U.S. citizens were barred from traveling from China, but there were 11 exceptions. Meanwhile, U.S. citizens and permanent residents could still travel from China but were subject to screening and a possible 14-day quarantine. Trump’s action did not take place in a vacuum. Many airlines were canceling flights, and by our count, at least 38 countries took similar action before or at the same time the U.S. restrictions were put in place.\n\nThe president said he took bold action that was criticized. News reports say he was reluctant to impose the ban, citing his relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, but the action was urged by his top health advisers. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters on Feb. 7: “The travel restrictions that we put in place in consultation with the president were very measured and incremental. These were the uniform recommendations of the career public health officials here at HHS.”Any criticism was scattered and relatively muted. Trump points to a comment by former vice president Biden — “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia … and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science” — but Biden says that did not refer to the travel restrictions.\n\nThe virus was already spreading through the United States, and there is little evidence the travel restrictions on China saved lives, especially because the Trump administration did not rapidly set up an effective testing regimen, as did many other countries.\n\nTrump also touts his restrictions on travel from some countries in Europe as effective. But a Washington Post examination found that his abrupt decision led to one final viral infusion before the country was forced to shut down. “The lapses surrounding the spread from Europe stand alongside other breakdowns — in developing diagnostic tests, securing protective gear and imposing social distancing guidelines — as reasons the United States became so overwhelmed,” The Post reported. “The travel mayhem was triggered by many of the same problems that plagued the U.S. response to the pandemic from the outset: Early warnings were missed or ignored. Coordination was chaotic or nonexistent. Key agencies fumbled their assignments. Trump’s errant statements undermined his administration’s plans and endangered the public.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"28381, 28850, 27712, 26301, 25480, 24921, 24951, 24268, 24038, 23373, 23690, 22084, 22081, 21960, 21028, 21597, 22483, 22259, 21356, 21246, 20835, 21079, 20671, 20039, 19944, 18761, 19393, 19338, 19784, 18990, 19752, 19215, 18868, 18825, 19574, 18756, 19260, 19263, 18708, 18938, 19178, 19189, 18617, 19433, 19108, 19024, 18514, 17894, 17698, 17692, 18497, 17870, 17985, 17624, 17640, 17862, 17863, 18077, 17565, 17542, 18443, 17857, 17860, 18127","repeated_count":"64","date":"08/27/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
