That's the agreement that Bernie Sanders and AOC and all these people made with sleepy Joe Biden. Now, I thought it would be their view, and then you're going to go right or toward the center, because that's the way it normally would work. But, it isn't.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The problem? The recommendations are much more moderate than Sanders's positions were, and Biden has said he will consider them but that they are not his official positions. For example, the recommendations do not call for Sanders's \"Medicare-for-all\" plan -- instead, they mirror Biden's plan: an expansion of the Affordable Care Act.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"30279, 29707, 29954, 30122, 27842, 26670, 27500, 26213, 25489, 25164, 25265, 26558, 26021, 26047, 25841, 25921, 24726, 24240, 24077, 23992, 23816, 23641, 23456, 23253, 23109, 20984, 22192, 21333, 22772, 22836, 21237, 22715, 22724, 22752, 22601","repeated_count":"35","date":"09/20/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
