Many of the report’s assertions have come under scrutiny or been debunked entirely — including the claim that Omar was involved with “illegal” ballot harvesting. Ballot harvesting — the practice of collecting and returning completed ballots for others — is legal in dozens of states.   Our fact-checking colleagues at USA Today <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/10/16/fact-check-project-veritas-no-proof-voter-fraud-scheme-link-ilhan-omar/3584614001/\">report</a> “Snapchat clips of Liban Mohamed that show him collecting dozens of absentee ballots are included in the Project Veritas video.” However he never worked for Omar’s campaign and the videos in question “do not include a date stamp, meaning they may have been taken within the weeks this summer that it was legal to collect an unlimited number of absentee ballots in Minnesota.” (As the result of a July 28 district court ruling, individuals could collect and return unlimited numbers of ballots in Minnesota. A Sept. 4 ruling reinstated the state’s previous rule that any one person could only collect and return three ballots.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/28/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
