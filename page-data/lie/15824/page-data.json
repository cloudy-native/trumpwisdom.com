So you'd say, really, from November 9th, the day after the election, up until January 20th, the Inauguration, the stock markets and jobs went -- literally, went through the roof. And if the election were lost, it would have gone right through the floor.”","analysis":"Trump inherited an economy that was in the middle of one of the longest post-World War II economic expansions on record. Most of the trends that Trump points to as \"success\" started under Obama.
