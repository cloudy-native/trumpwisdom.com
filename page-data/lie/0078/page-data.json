Trump’s assertion he has “no deals in Russia” is misleading at best, since Trump has actively pursued deals there and has relied on Russia investors. As for the nuclear agreement with Iran, that agreement was forged with the assistance of diplomats from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, China, Russia and the European Union. Obama did not negotiate it alone.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"29883, 26544, 19600, 19617, 10729, 6635, 7230, 4817, 7229, 7228, 7227, 7226, 7225, 7221, 0100, 0078","repeated_count":"16","date":"02/07/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
