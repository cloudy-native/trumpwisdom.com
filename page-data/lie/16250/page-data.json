We had a tax on dairy products, 297 percent tariff. Nobody talked about it with Canada, and we had some really bad things with Mexico.”","analysis":"Canada does have high dairy tariffs, just as the United States props up sugar prices. But Canada’s overall tariffs are lower. In the reworked trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, Trump won some narrow concessions on dairy, allowing for new quotas — but high tariffs are still permitted when those quotas are exceeded. Canada’s concessions were only marginally better than dairy elements in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement negotiated by the Obama administration, which Trump pulled out of early in his presidency.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"28985, 26859, 27309, 25250, 24375, 22421, 22557, 22587, 20492, 20771, 18041, 17456, 17845, 16708, 16099, 16250, 12423, 12189, 11468, 10462, 10229, 9677, 8965, 6028, 6287, 5998, 5438, 5783, 5702, 5706, 5725, 5127, 5140, 5659, 5670, 4793, 4994, 4938, 4940, 4694, 4630, 4669, 4440, 4590, 4665, 3695, 3871, 4083, 3835, 4077, 3571, 3988, 4018, 3825, 3484, 3941, 3915, 3362, 3682, 3910, 3306, 3295","repeated_count":"62","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
