So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!”","analysis":"Democrats had not taken power in the House as of Jan. 1, when Trump tweeted this, so it's not clear where they would have allocated or withheld money for a wall. In any case, southern border apprehensions have been declining for 20 years and are down more than 80 percent since their recent peak in 2000 because of reduced immigration rates from Mexico, a surge in Border Patrol officers since the 1990s, tougher penalties post-9/11 and new border security technology. The primary issue at the border is waves of Central American families coming to seek asylum. Any wall would be built a mile or so inland from the border. Many of the families attempting to immigrate from Central America are seeking asylum. To petition for asylum, a person needs to be on U.S. soil under current law. So in theory, immigrants could cross the border and file a legally valid petition for asylum before reaching Trump's wall.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
