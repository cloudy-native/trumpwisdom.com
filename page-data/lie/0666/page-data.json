They've spent many billions of dollars, and we are getting that whole system fixed. Money wasted over the last six or seven years -- billions.”","analysis":"Trump is referring to the NextGen program, to modernize the air traffic control system. The planning began in 2000 and faced delays from the beginning. But some new capabilities under NextGen are already in effect or on track for 2020-2025. While the majority of the $7.4 billion the Federal Aviation Administration received for NextGen was given to the agency in fiscal 2009-2016, it represents just 4 percent of the total money appropriated to the FAA between fiscal 2004 (when the program began) and fiscal 2016. Moreover, Trump's proposal to spin off the air traffic control system as a private entity faces widespread opposition in Congress.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/19/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
