If we were paying less, I would do it, and I'd pay off a lot of debt.”","analysis":"With this comment, Trump demonstrates little understanding of federal finances. Trump is running up $1 trillion in budget deficits a year so he's in no position to start paying down the federal debt; he has significantly added to the national debt. Government debt cannot be refinanced like mortgages. Treasury bonds promise a fixed yield until maturity. The government could issue new bonds and buy the old bonds back, but this wouldn't reduce interest payments at all.
