I brought them back. They have two nice qualities: They're cheaper and they're better.”","analysis":"Trump is trying to justify the weakening of rules to promote the extension of light bulb energy-efficiency standards. He appears to be talking about compact fluorescent, or CFL, bulbs, which contain mercury and tend to have harsher color quality. But he's out of date. The National Electrical Manufacturers Association <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nema.org/Intelligence/Indices/Pages/LED-A-line-Halogen-and-CFL-Lamp-Shipments-Decrease-in-First-Quarter-2019-Compared-to-First-Quarter-2018.aspx\">says</a> that in 2019 CFLs accounted for less than 5 percent of all sales of the classic pear-shaped bulbs. Light-emitting diode, or LED, bulbs are the dominant environmentally friendly technology. They don't have safety risks and often provide comparable light at a cheaper lifetime cost than incandescents. LEDs currently made up more than 70 percent of sales.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"21307, 21182, 16330, 13543, 13733, 12758, 12708","repeated_count":"7","date":"07/16/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
