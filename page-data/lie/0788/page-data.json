In Alaska, they went up over 200 percent recently. We know that. In Arizona, they've been up 118 percent.”","analysis":"Trump cherry-picks the high end of premium increases by selecting Alaska’s 203 percent increase, even though the average monthly premium across the country was up about 25 percent before subsidies. Trump also uses the calculation of premium increases without incorporating the impact of tax credits — which most people in the exchanges receive. If you take the subsidies into account, the average monthly premium of most people in the individual market exchange goes down, not up. Finally, it’s an apples-to-oranges comparison by using figures from 2013 — before most major provisions of Obamacare had taken effect — and comparing them to ones from 2017.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"6005, 5138, 1440, 1468, 1229, 1230, 1231, 1216, 1078, 0901, 0788, 0738, 0732, 0708, 0707, 0252","repeated_count":"16","date":"07/19/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
