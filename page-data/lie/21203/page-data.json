Absentee ballots are great. You request them, they send them. It's been happening for a long time. Florida, other states, that works. But just to send millions of ballots in the mail, who knows who's getting them. They pick up a stack of them, who knows who's getting them. It's ripe for fraud. It will be fraud. It'll be a bad thing.”","analysis":"Trump has made a series of baseless claims about the danger of mail-in ballots, apparently out of a fear that it favors Democrats. There’s no evidence that mail-in balloting favors Democrats over Republicans. Indeed, Trump's own administration highlighted how his false claims on voting-by-mail were almost identical to the Russian propaganda being spread online to destabilize U.S. politics. Trump frequently say absentee ballots are fine but mail-in ballots are not, but they are functionally the same thing. Research <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/16/universal-vote-by-mail-doesnt-benefit-any-political-party-study-finds/\">published in 2020</a> found that encouraging widespread voting by mail yielded “a truly negligible effect” on turnout and vote share by party. Moreover, documented instances of voter fraud are exceedingly rare in the United States. The same is true with absentee voting, according to Richard L. Hasen, an elections expert at the University of California at Irvine. “There were 491 prosecutions related to absentee ballots in all elections nationwide between 2000 and 2012, out of literally billions of ballots cast,” Hasen <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/05/20/trump-mail-vote-fraud/\">wrote in an essay for The Washington Post</a>. That's because it is hard to commit fraud even though Trump claims it is easy to duplicate ballots and distribute them, or even to grab them from mailboxes. Cast ballots are confirmed against existing information to ensure that fraudulent voting doesn't occur. In many states, it would also be necessary to know how the voter associated with the ballot signs his or her name and then forge it convincingly. In order to swing an election, a fraudster would need to do this hundreds or thousands of times.
