You know, with have 180 million people with private healthcare. A lot of you have private healthcare. It's what you dream of, it's great. You negotiate, you have many great companies doing it, they compete. You have great private healthcare. They want to terminate it.”","analysis":"Some Democrats, especially in the House, have rallied around a proposal called \"Medicare for all\" championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The plan would eliminate private plans and create national health insurance. But Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, opposed the idea. He advocated a more incremental approach to expand the Affordable Care Act. Trump was obviously hoping his opponent would be Sanders, so in his campaign rallies he simply pretends that Biden has the same policies.
