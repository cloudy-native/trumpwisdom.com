And it's been signed many times before. It's been signed by other presidents. From 1977 or so, it gave the presidents the power. There's rarely been a problem. They sign it; nobody cares. I guess they weren't very exciting. But nobody cares. They sign it for far less important things in some cases -- in many cases.”","analysis":"We will leave it to the courts to sort out whether Trump’s action is constitutional or not, but Trump oversimplifies the rationale behind the National Emergencies Act of 1976. Previously presidents acted with authority inherent in the Constitution, but Congress intended to formalize the process, including terminating standing emergencies. The law was intended to clarify presidential power and give Congress the option to thwart a presidential declaration, not to give “the power” to presidents. Originally, that required simply passage of a resolution by both houses of Congress, but a Supreme Court ruling in 1983 forced Congress to amend the law to require a presidential signature or overturning a presidential veto.\n\nThe Brennan Center at New York University has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/NEA%20Declarations.pdf\">documented</a> dozens of times that presidents have issued an emergency declaration under this law, often related to blocking property or transactions with certain foreign governments or individuals. The 1976 law has no definition of an emergency, and legal experts say no one appears to have previously challenged whether a presidential determination of an emergency is valid.","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
