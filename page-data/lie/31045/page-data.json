This is far more than the Americans are given.”","analysis":"Trump frames this is  a misleading manner. Under the bipartisan agreement, U.S. citizens and green card holders will be able to receive $600 in direct aid, even if they filed a joint tax return with an undocumented spouse, as well as additional $600 checks per dependent child. They were denied such checks under the first round of legislation, but the bill will also retroactively make mixed-status families with one Social Security number-holder eligible for the $1,200 per household and $500 per child checks allocated by the CARES Act. Trump suggests undocumented immigrants will get stimulus checks but they cannot because they need a valid Social Security number. Family members of undocumented immigrants are now eligible for these payments, so long as they qualify. These family members must be citizens or green card holders, with a social security number to collect their stimulus checks.
