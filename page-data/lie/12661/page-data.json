I knew it existed. And I've seen some Category 4s; you don't even see them that much. But a Category 5 is something that I don’t know that I've even heard the term other than I know it's there. That’s the ultimate.”","analysis":"This is an odd comment, since he has spoken of Category 5 hurricanes in the past. At a May 8, 2019, rally, for instance, Trump said: “I've just come from a stop at Tyndall Air Force Base, where I saw the devastating effects of that Category 5 hurricane, Category 5. Never heard about Category 5s before, a Category 5 is big stuff.” Trump also visited an Air Force base in northwestern Florida that sustained considerable damage from Hurricane Michael. That storm made history in 2018 as the first to hit the United States as a Category 5 since 1992.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/01/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
