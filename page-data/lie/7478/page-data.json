People are pouring into our country, including terrorists. We have terrorists. But we caught 10 terrorists. These are over the last very short period of time — 10. These are very serious people. All of our law enforcement have been incredible, but we caught 10 terrorists, these are people that were looking to do harm. We need the wall. We need — more important than anything, we need border security of which the wall is just a piece, but it’s important.”","analysis":"Trump’s claim that terrorists are entering the country over the southern border is nothing new. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has said this before. So has Vice President Pence. But it’s misleading. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in June that “on average, my department now blocks 10 known or suspected terrorists a day from traveling to or attempting to enter the United States.” But that includes all ports of entry. And almost all suspected terrorists are apprehended at airports — not along the southern border. In a recent report, the State Department found “no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.” In other words, Trump’s border wall would do little to stop potential terrorists trying to enter the country.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31493, 27510, 7981, 8210, 7718, 7646, 7478, 7276","repeated_count":"8","date":"12/11/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
