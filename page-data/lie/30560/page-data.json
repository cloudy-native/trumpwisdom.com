Needs a little time statutorily. Will happen soon!”","analysis":"It was not looking very good for Trump in Wisconsin. Wisconsin is one of the states in the “blue wall” that Biden won back for the Democrats. Biden is ahead by 20,546, or 0.5 percent. Trump can request a recount once the results are finalized since the margin is under 1 percent. But because Biden is ahead by more than 0.25 percent, state law requires Trump to pay for it. Green Party candidate Jill Stein requested a recount in 2016, and it cost nearly $3.5 million. Generally, a gap of 20,000 votes will be unaffected by a recount. Trump’s margin of victory in 2016 — just over 22,500 votes — gained by 131 votes after the recount.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
