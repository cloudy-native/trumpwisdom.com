So, she calls me up like eight months ago. Her husband was there a long time, but I didn't give him the B treatment. I didn't give him the C or the D. I could have. Nobody would ask. You know, I gave the A-plus treatment. Take down the flags. Why are you taking them down for ex-Congressman Dingell? Oh, okay. Do this, do that, do that rotunda, everything. I gave them everything. That’s okay. I don't want anything for it. I don't need anything for anything. She calls me up: ‘It’s the nicest thing that’s ever happened. Thank you so much. John would be so thrilled. He’s looking down, he’d be so — thank you so much, sir.’ I said: ‘That’s okay. Don’t worry about it.’ Maybe he’s looking up. I don’t know. ... No, but I look at her and she’s so sincere and what happens? ‘I vote to impeach Trump.’”","analysis":"Let’s leave aside Trump’s suggestion that Rep. John Dingell is in hell. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), who succeeded her late husband in Congress, said she didn't call Trump. “He called me to tell me he was lowering the flags,” she said. “And that meant a lot. But John Dingell earned his burial at Arlington Cemetery because he’s a World War II veteran.” Trump also implied that he arranged for Dingell to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda, but Dingell did not lie in state there (and such decisions are left to congressional leaders, not the president).","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"15853","repeated_count":"1","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
