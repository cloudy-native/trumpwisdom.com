Biden's tax plan would raise $4 trillion but the revenue would come from corporations and only people making more than $400,000 a year. (An updated estimate by the Tax Policy Center in September reduced that figure to $2.1 trillion.)  There is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/08/31/joe-bidens-claim-that-he-wont-raise-taxes-people-making-less-than-400000/\">broad agreement</a> among five leading tax models that Biden’s tax increase would fall almost entirely on the very wealthy. For technical reasons, Biden's proposed corporate tax increase is deemed to filter through to almost all income groups, giving Trump an opening to misleadingly claim that Biden is raising taxes on most (\"82 percent\") Americans. But a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/9/14/biden-2020-analysis\">revised Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate</a> that includes Biden's proposed tax credits found Biden would reduce taxes for all taxpayers in the bottom 90 percent — even if the theoretical effect of the corporate tax cut was included. Overall, Biden’s $400,000 pledge holds up well, especially when considering the impact on individual taxpayers. In the few instances where we identified a situation in which a taxpayer might inadvertently find themselves snared by a tax change despite not making $400,000, the Biden campaign said it would craft the tax bill to fix the problem.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Taxes","repeated_ids":"29776, 29321, 29394, 29620, 29485, 28883, 28897, 28930, 29077, 28606, 28690, 28430, 28264, 27957, 27579, 27797, 27869, 27910, 26994, 26755, 26782, 26858, 26617, 26716, 27078, 27137, 27394, 26919, 26932, 27296, 27450, 27551, 26367, 26438, 26491, 26244, 26094, 26156, 25693, 25716, 25742, 25460, 25487, 25425, 25336, 25159, 25585, 25859, 25070, 25030, 24687, 25132, 24247, 23356, 23814, 23470, 23504, 23244, 23162, 23076, 22110, 21986, 21946, 21911, 21012, 21582, 22411, 22512, 22932, 22965, 22148, 22199, 22899, 21902, 21334, 22777, 22839, 21239, 21637, 20851","repeated_count":"80","date":"09/10/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
