It shouldn't be shut down. They should be opened up. The governor has them totally shut down and it's purely political. And on November fourth, right after the election, the governor will say, ‘Okay, it's time to open up.’ She's trying to make the economy look as bad as possible. And that goes for North Carolina, that goes from Pennsylvania. … Because Democrat governors are trying to shut down states because they want to look as bad as possible for the election.”","analysis":"Trump falsely claims Democrats in Congress and Democratic governors are using the pandemic to harm the economy before the election and are planning to reverse course on November 4. Democrats in the House have actually passed a substantial economic-relief bill that the GOP majority in the Senate has refused to consider. If Democrats truly wanted to hurt the economy to enhance their chances of victory in the November election, they would not be pressing for more action. Similarly, Trump falsely says Democratic governors will lift an coronavirus restrictions the day after Election Day because they are only trying to thwart his re-election. That did not happen, as covid-19 cases kept soaring.
