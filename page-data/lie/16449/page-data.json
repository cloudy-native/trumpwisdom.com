And you know, I see it better than you because I'm involved. In other words, we call up and we say, ‘That story is wrong. Would you please make a correction?’ And they say, ‘No.’ We say, ‘But the story is wrong.’ They say, ‘We don't care.’ They don't care. These people are really corrupt and dishonest, okay? And it's a shame.”","analysis":"The Trump administration repeatedly denies reports that turn out to be true. When Trump doesn't like what’s being reported, he calls it fake news or complains about media bias. But in almost every case, the reports are proven to be accurate and the substance of Trump’s complaint is that the facts reflect poorly on him. Reputable news organizations follow ethical rules and correct mistakes promptly, something Trump knows since he often celebrates these corrections on Twitter.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
