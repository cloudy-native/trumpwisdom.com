We cannot lose our steel industry.  It’s a fraction of what it once was.  And we can’t lose our aluminum industry.  Also a fraction of what it once was.”","analysis":"The industries are not dead. Trump is focused on aluminum smelting jobs, but that’s only 3 percent of total aluminum industry jobs in the United States, according to the Aluminum Association. The rest of the jobs are in aluminum production and processing, which has been relatively consistent since 1980. Meanwhile, U.S. steel exports as a share of the domestic market are only 27.5 percent, about the level in 1997. Monthly crude steel production has been consistent since the Great Recession. Fewer workers are required because the factories are run more efficiently.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"29780, 29347, 29493, 29749, 29123, 28074, 28325, 26632, 24774, 23474, 20989, 19323, 17936, 17109, 17286, 18151, 16197, 15437, 15830, 14939, 14020, 13773, 12291, 11631, 12041, 12199, 11458, 11800, 11026, 10579, 10941, 10314, 10288, 9977, 9990, 9755, 9666, 9392, 8872, 8847, 8572, 8508, 8068, 7969, 7977, 7397, 7421, 7017, 7441, 6789, 6938, 6973, 6792, 6771, 7061, 6576, 6279, 6284, 6122, 5400, 5586, 5613, 5263, 5784, 5652, 4791, 4589, 4703, 4604, 4711, 4414, 4278, 4570, 4533, 4560, 3764, 3447, 3448, 2791, 2496, 2499, 2467","repeated_count":"82","date":"03/06/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
