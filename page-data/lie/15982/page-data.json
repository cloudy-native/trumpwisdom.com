This is an ex post facto explanation that strains credulity. He repeatedly requested that Ukrainian officials meet with his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. In a May, 2019 letter to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky requesting a meeting, Giuliani stated he was representing Trump “as a private citizen, not as the president of the United States,” and also that Giuliani was carrying out this mission with Trump’s “knowledge and consent.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"16312, 15982, 15859, 15941, 16232, 15214, 15236, 15220, 15219","repeated_count":"9","date":"12/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
