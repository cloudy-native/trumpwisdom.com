With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!”","analysis":"As we have repeatedly noted, the president misunderstands the impact of trade deficits, which he blames on the North American Free Trade Agreement. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country.\n\nUnder NAFTA, the supply chain of the auto industry became integrated between the United States and its immediate neighbors. Auto parts and vehicles produced in each country freely flow over the borders, without tariffs or other restrictions, as thousands of part suppliers serve the automakers that build the vehicles. An estimated 40 percent of goods sent to the United States by Mexico incorporate U.S. content, according to the International Trade Administration.\n\nAs for Mexico having “very strong border laws,” PolitiFact reported that the White House pointed to a 2010 Washington Times article as evidence — but the Mexican law was changed in 2011 to decriminalize the act of entering the country without documentation and to allow undocumented immigrants to use education and health services. Moreover, Mexico’s own southern border is much more porous than the U.S. southern border.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/02/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
