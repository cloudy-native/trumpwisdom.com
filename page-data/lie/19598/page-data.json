And he was the first one. … He understood that it was a hoax before anybody else knew what was happening.”","analysis":"Trump has drawn attention to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/826262311560216578\">a tweet</a> by Mark Zaid, attorney for the whistleblower, on Jan. 30, 2017 which said “#coup has started” and that “#impeachment will follow ultimately.” He tweeted it over a tweet about the firing of Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. Trump suggests that Zaid was threatening a coup. But Zaid <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whistleblower-attorney-coup-trump\">said</a> that was not the case: “I was referring to a completely lawful process of what President Trump would likely face as a result of stepping over the line, and that particularly whatever would happen would come about as a result of lawyers. The coup comment referred to those working inside the Administration who were already, just a week into office, standing up to him to enforce recognized rules of law.“","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"25296, 25937, 25832, 20245, 19755, 19709, 19598, 19619, 18503, 14525, 15269, 15625, 15566","repeated_count":"13","date":"05/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
