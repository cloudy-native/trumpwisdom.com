The family unit by definition must include at least one parent or legal guardian and one minor. (There’s a separate figure for unaccompanied alien children.) DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman said the December total for apprehensions of unaccompanied children and those with family members was 19,313. But it’s wrong to describe it as a statistic that represents children being smuggled into the country. Trump describes this as children being smuggled in by coyotes or gangs, but border officials screen for false claims of parentage. Trump appears to be acknowledging there are no firm numbers for the number who might have hired a smuggler, coyote or gang member -- though there is no evidence that the figure would be \"thousands.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8275, 8113, 7806, 7766, 8214, 7875","repeated_count":"6","date":"01/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
