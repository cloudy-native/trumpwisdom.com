Did you see the Virginia governor? I mean he gave a whole exposé, the baby is born. And then basically they start talking to the mother. The baby is born and there's no other word. If the mother decides no, then they execute the baby. Ok, he's the governor of Virginia.”","analysis":"Trump mischaracterizes remarks by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D), even sometimes claiming that Northam himself killed a baby. Northam told a radio show that late-term abortion procedures are “done in cases where there may be severe deformities. There may be a fetus that’s not viable. So in this particular example, if a mother’s in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.” Critics suggested the governor was endorsing infanticide. His office later said the governor was referring to medical treatment, not ending the life of a baby.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"28530, 25157, 25093, 24664, 24578, 22530, 20102, 17825, 18190, 15447, 15528, 14681, 13939, 12697, 12440, 11633, 11491, 11811, 10888, 10267, 9720, 9556, 9146, 8736","repeated_count":"24","date":"12/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
