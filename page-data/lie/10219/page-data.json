In 2018, it was $68 billion when only looking at trade in goods; the overall deficit would be lower if trade in services is included. As we've explained before, countries do not \"lose\" money on trade deficits. A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. In this case, the U.S. has a trade deficit on goods and a trade surplus of services, so the overall trade deficit was $58 billion, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/exh20.pdf\">according to the Census Bureau</a>.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"28743, 23400, 22218, 21072, 21133, 21151, 20139, 17143, 16071, 14886, 14887, 14630, 13882, 13558, 13700, 12501, 12917, 12921, 11706, 11576, 11388, 12211, 11552, 11394, 12181, 12229, 11467, 11302, 11838, 11789, 11711, 10631, 10481, 10942, 10939, 10396, 10337, 10218, 10219, 10231, 9873, 9814, 9675, 9676, 9484, 9542, 9311, 9079, 9106, 9025, 8999, 8890, 8816, 8449, 8576, 8594, 8372, 7830, 7832, 7739, 7305, 7393, 7394, 7538, 7492, 6692, 7026, 6583, 6274, 6024, 6035, 6295, 6220, 6249, 6018, 6019, 6192, 6113, 6116, 6117, 6129, 6096, 5867, 5912, 5442, 6319, 6320, 6082, 5334, 5359, 5387, 5293, 5302, 5304, 5529, 5824, 5826, 5837, 5844, 5225, 5252, 5254, 5285, 5770, 5708, 5716, 5128, 5671, 5639, 5641, 4802, 4822, 4932, 5010, 4769, 4593, 4607, 4676, 4674, 4585, 4327, 4543, 3718, 3729, 3657, 3658, 3674, 3675, 3876, 3806, 3650, 3739, 3837, 4048, 4049, 4060, 3441, 3442, 3572, 3576, 3985, 3991, 4027, 3415, 3966, 3913, 3914, 3349, 3361, 3363, 3366, 3661, 3144, 3140, 3215, 3115, 2990, 2705, 2717, 2674, 2758, 2898, 2856, 2844, 2794, 2806, 2543, 2485, 2486, 2460, 2448, 2449, 2452, 2200, 2276, 2072, 2073, 1958, 1956, 1736, 1591, 2095, 3006, 1504, 0264","repeated_count":"185","date":"04/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
