A terrible decision”","analysis":"There is little evidence that the ruling halting Trump’s order has allowed “very bad and dangerous people” to pour into the country. The practical effect of the order was to restore visas and refugee admissions. Being accepted as a refugee in the United States is a difficult, lengthy process. Obtaining a U.S. visa generally requires an in-person interview, unless you are a citizen of one of 38 countries that participate in the visa-waiver program. Under a 2015 law, however, four of the seven countries covered in the ban require even dual citizens to have an in-person interview.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/04/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
