Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The problem? The recommendations are much more moderate than Sanders's positions were, and Biden has said he will consider them but that they are not his official positions. For example, the recommendations do not call for Sanders's \"Medicare-for-all\" plan -- instead, they mirror Biden's plan: an expansion of the Affordable Care Act.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"30279, 29707, 29954, 30122, 27842, 26670, 27500, 26213, 25489, 25164, 25265, 26558, 26021, 26047, 25841, 25921, 24726, 24240, 24077, 23992, 23816, 23641, 23456, 23253, 23109, 20984, 22192, 21333, 22772, 22836, 21237, 22715, 22724, 22752, 22601","repeated_count":"35","date":"10/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
