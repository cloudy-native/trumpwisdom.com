They had fairways, that's about all they used with the fairways. And now, we have something right through the runways, the landing strips, it was all grass infested, it was all weed-infested and now, it's the number one Space Center in the world by far. It was a closed up mess and we have rich guys sending up rockets, Elon and others. They send up rockets and we say let them keep going.”","analysis":"This is ridiculous. In reality, President Obama set in motion the process that led to the successful SpaceX launch with astronauts. He decided to send crews via commercial spacecraft in 2011, an initiative that encountered fierce opposition from Congress, which at first did not provide as much money as NASA sought. Trump sometimes offers an image of a NASA space center with grass growing on the tarmac and in shambles, but that's false.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30651, 29848, 29255, 29555, 29724, 28489, 29004, 27906, 27742, 28250, 27174, 27487, 26466, 26132, 25572, 25477, 25446, 25275, 26592, 25931, 24947, 24870, 24700, 24574, 24462, 24112, 23707, 23518, 22080, 22870, 19809, 19813, 9170, 4043, 3541, 3279","repeated_count":"36","date":"09/22/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
