They took over a big chunk of the city, 20 percent of the city.”","analysis":"Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan flatly denied to The Washington Post PlumLine that any conversation like this with Trump — or anyone around him — ever took place. “He never contacted me or my office to warn us,” Durkan said, adding that no one from the White House and no one connected to Trump had told them any such thing. “We had no conversations whatsoever with the White House about anything related to the protests, Capitol Hill, or anything along these lines,” Durkan told us, though conversations related to coronavirus had taken place at various junctures. “It just never happened,” Durkan said. “I don't know what world he’s living in.” The mayor had signed an executive order on June 30th to formally close the area and on July 1 police moved in to clear it.  Meanwhile, Trump exaggerates about Seattle's Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ). Durkan described as \"four blocks in Seattle that is more like a block party atmosphere. It's not an armed takeover. It's not a military junta. We will make sure that we will restore this but we have block parties and the like in this part of Seattle all the time ... there is no threat right now to the public.\" CHAZ was established on June 8 and cleared of occupants by police on July 1 after some violence occurred. But that was not the case at the time of these remarks. No evidence of Antifa involvement emerged.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"29810, 30167, 30286, 29374, 29697, 28935, 28389, 28152, 28319, 27082, 27119, 27218, 27507, 26366, 26000, 25877, 25067, 25082, 24998, 24933, 24821, 24728, 24257, 23826, 23475, 23248, 23204, 20960, 21325, 21769, 21788, 21616, 20848, 20716, 20769","repeated_count":"35","date":"09/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
