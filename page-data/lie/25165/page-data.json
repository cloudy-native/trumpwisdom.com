You know why? Because they send millions of gallons of water out to sea, out to the Pacific, because they want to take care of certain little tiny fish that aren't doing very well without water, to be honest with you. But it's a very sad thing that's happening.”","analysis":"Trump has a dim understanding of the debate in California over water supply. He suggests that water is being diverted away from the Central Valley simply to preserve a \"tiny fish\" -- the delta smelt, about three inches long. As the Los Angeles Times <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-10-09/trump-unhinged-california-water-fires\">noted</a>, \"the smelt is important not merely in itself but also as a bellwether of the health of the entire delta ecosystem — and the responsibility of humans as stewards of the environment is to not force species into extinction.\" If the delta smelt go, California may be able to pump some more. But then their cousins, the longfin smelt, could disappear next, and then the steelhead trout, and then the various populations of Chinook salmon.  In May, 2020, a federal judge in Fresno has blocked his administration’s plan to pump more supplies through the Delta. The judge, siding with Gov. Gavin Newsom, ruled the increased pumping would harm the very fish species Trump likes to mock.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"25165, 24730, 24857","repeated_count":"3","date":"10/08/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
