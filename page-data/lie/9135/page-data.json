It's not true, folks. Okay? It's false. It's false propaganda. One recent study from FAIR found that illegal aliens are incarcerated at three times the rate of legal residents. Those are the numbers. And if you look at prison population in federal prisons … the numbers are staggering, the number of illegals. Far, far, far greater than any proportion of our population, but you don't hear that. You hear, like, ‘These people are the greatest people in the world.’”","analysis":"There is no nationwide data set on crime committed by undocumented immigrants, so researchers have tried to tease the answer from less-than-complete data. Yet study after study shows that illegal immigration does not lead to increased crime, violence or drug problems. In fact, the studies indicate that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born Americans. So it's not propaganda, but simply flies in the face of Trump's repeated claims that immigrants bring crime. As for the federal prison population, about 17 percent of all of the individuals in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons or U.S. Marshals Service were confirmed to be living in the U.S. illegally, as of Dec. 31, 2017, according to data <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2019/02/trumps-misdirection-on-criminal-aliens/\">examined by FactCheck.org</a>. Moreover, it's wrong to focus on just the federal prison population when the overwhelming majority of inmates are incarcerated in state prisons and local jails.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
