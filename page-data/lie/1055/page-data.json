We’re fixing the inner cities. We’re doing far more than anybody’s done with respect to the inner cities. It’s a priority for me. And it’s very important.”","analysis":"Trump’s claim reflects a misunderstanding of black communities and is incongruous with his budget proposals. “Inner cities” is not synonymous with black communities, so he gets a basic fact wrong about where black Americans are concentrated in this country. Moreover, Trump proposed steep reductions to a variety of programs that disproportionately affect minority communities and lower-income Americans, from education to housing. There is a $225 billion backlog to fix America’s inner cities, yet Trump’s budget does not reflect a genuine prioritization of projects to reduce this backlog.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/15/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
