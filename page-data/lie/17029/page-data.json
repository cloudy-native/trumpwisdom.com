Think of that President Bush, I say it all the time. President Bush, eight years, $450 dollars, President Barack Hussein Obama, eight years. Eight years, $975. President Donald John Trump, three years, factually less when they did the numbers. Three years, including the big tax cuts that we got you and the regulation cuts, three years, so you had $450, $975. That's eight and eight, now we're down to three years, little less three years, $10,000 per family a year. $10,000 a year.”","analysis":"Trump is adding together a bunch of dubious assumptions, in particular claims of regulatory savings for Americans. We've <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/08/15/trumps-claim-his-deregulatory-moves-are-saving-american-households-year/\">previously fact-checked</a> Trump's claim of giving households $3,000 a year in regulatory savings. By itself, it's a Three-Pinocchio claim. This is derived from a White House estimate that after five to 10 years, the administration's freeze on new regulations and rollback of Obama-era regulations will raise real incomes by $3,100 per household per year. The estimate depends on a lot of assumptions and some cherry-picking but a bigger problem is that Trump speaks as if this pile of money is already landing in a household's pocket. The president never mentions actions taken by the administration that have reduced household income. For instance, Federal Reserve Bank of New York officials <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2019/05/new-china-tariffs-increase-costs-to-us-households.html?mod=article_inlin\">peg</a> Trump's tariffs as already costing the typical U.S. household $831 a year. He frequently makes a comparison to numbers under George W. Bush and Barack Obama but those are apples-and-oranges comparisons.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"28798, 28980, 26439, 26247, 26167, 25851, 25037, 24606, 21999, 22928, 22187, 22832, 18464, 18070, 17029, 17501, 18257, 18286, 16834, 18195, 16743, 16715, 16532, 16113, 16183, 16325, 15426, 14935, 15713, 15746, 14563, 15847","repeated_count":"32","date":"02/21/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
