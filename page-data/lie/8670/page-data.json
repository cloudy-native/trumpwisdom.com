It would be great for the so-called “Carbon Footprint” to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!”","analysis":"Trump is misrepresenting the Green New Deal as the plan is currently written. The resolution in Congress is full of sweeping ambition and grand goals, but it’s also vaguer and more moderate than he says. There’s nothing in there about putting an end to cars or cows or air travel or the military.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"30947, 29481, 29087, 28444, 27661, 28858, 28016, 28106, 28265, 27801, 27628, 26956, 26628, 27085, 27336, 26371, 26396, 26095, 26159, 25530, 25163, 26539, 26002, 24409, 24184, 24091, 23465, 23117, 22449, 22292, 22908, 20867, 21903, 22691, 21514, 20053, 20282, 18570, 16839, 16210, 16441, 15705, 14141, 13650, 12759, 11047, 11792, 10486, 10513, 10887, 10264, 10171, 9883, 9712, 9531, 9588, 9075, 9128, 9043, 8730, 8670","repeated_count":"61","date":"02/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
