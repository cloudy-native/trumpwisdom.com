Trump attached a presentation on \"border security\" mentioning 3,755 \"known or suspected terrorists\" blocked from entering the country in fiscal 2017. The Trump administration has also cited 3,028 \"special interest aliens\" encountered in fiscal 2017. But most of the cases of \"known or suspected terrorists\" involve people who were blocked while trying to fly into the United States or denied visas. In the case of \"special interest aliens,\" we're talking about people who may be fleeing violence in the Middle East or Africa. The administration has not offered examples of individuals linked to terrorism who crossed through the southern border. The State Department says in yearly reports that terrorists don't cross through Mexico.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31493, 27510, 7981, 8210, 7718, 7646, 7478, 7276","repeated_count":"8","date":"01/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
