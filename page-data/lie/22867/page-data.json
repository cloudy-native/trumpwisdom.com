A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/10/20-1315_article\">large study conducted in South Korea</a> using contact tracing found that children ages 10 to 19 can spread the virus at least as much as adults do; children younger than 10 were half as likely to transmit the virus, but there was still a risk.
