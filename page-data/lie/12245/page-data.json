And we're the ones that said they were crowded. They're crowded because we have a lot of people. But they're in good shape. And the reason is because the fake-news New York Times wrote a phony story...I had people calling me up at the highest levels from Border Patrol and ICE, almost crying, about that phony story. And they never saw anything. They have phony sources. They don't even have sources. They write whatever they want. The New York Times is a very dishonest newspaper. They write what they want.”","analysis":"The New York Times on July 9 <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/07/06/us/migrants-border-patrol-clint.html\">reported</a> on harrowing conditions at a migrant detention facility in Clint, Texas: \"Outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox were spreading among the hundreds of children and adults who were being held in cramped cells, agents said. The stench of the children’s dirty clothing was so strong it spread to the agents’ own clothing — people in town would scrunch their noses when they left work. The children cried constantly. One girl seemed likely enough to try to kill herself that the agents made her sleep on a cot in front of them, so they could watch her as they were processing new arrivals.\" The story relied on interviews and on-the-ground reporting, not on fabrications.

A Washington Post reporter who visited border detention centers as part of a group with Vice President Pence <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jdawsey1/status/1150089744501678080\">found</a> that one center housing children was relatively clean and air conditioned, while another center housing mostly men was overcrowded, hot and dirty.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
