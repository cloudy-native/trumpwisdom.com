And you can ask President Obama, he was very close to going to war and he would have lost 50 million people, plus... The rhetoric was very strong. In the meantime for eight months you've had not one rocket launch, missile launch and you haven't had one nuclear test. … Under the Obama administration they were launching missiles, they were testing. They're not doing that anymore. That could start tomorrow. Who knows. And if it does, I won't be happy. But for eight months there's been not one rocket or missile launch or there hasn't been a nuclear test.”","analysis":"Trump indicates North Korea has let up its nuclear activities since he and Kim Jong Un signed a vague joint statement on denuclearization June 12. But experts say and satellite imagery indicates that North Korea continues to pursue a nuclear program. The Washington Post reported that U.S. spy agencies are seeing signs that North Korea is constructing new missiles at a factory that produced the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States. North Korea conducted 74 missile tests during the Obama administration, or roughly one test every five and a half weeks. The rate was far higher during Trump’s first year in office: 20 tests, or roughly one test every two and a half weeks. Trump exaggerates the North Korean nuclear threat during Barack Obama's administration and exaggerates the number of potential casualties. According to the Congressional Research Service, “an escalation of a military conflict on the peninsula could affect upwards of 25 million people on either side of the border.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"4245, 3815, 3902, 4126, 3931","repeated_count":"5","date":"07/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
