There is no evidence it occurs in great numbers, is intentional, or disadvantages one party more than then the other.)","pinocchios":"4","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"31117, 30817, 30795, 30762, 31413, 30716","repeated_count":"6","date":"11/26/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
