The claim that Biden's plan would destroy 5 trillion jobs is fiction. The number comes from a report co-written by President Trump’s former chief economic adviser, so it’s clearly designed for campaign weaponization. The number is an estimate for 2030, a decade in the future — not even during a theoretical two-term Biden presidency -- and is disputed by other, more reputable analyses.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"27955, 26808","repeated_count":"2","date":"10/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
