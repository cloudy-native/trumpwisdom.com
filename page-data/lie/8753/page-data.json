Now, listen to the this, so you're talking a few feet away, right, a few feet, got a wall, a few feet away. Last year Juarez had 1,200 murders, El Paso, right next door, a few feet away, had 23 murders. That's not good either. But 23 compared to 1,200.”","analysis":"Here, Trump appears to be echoing comments he heard from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Jan. 10, but this claim is wrong. The El Paso Times, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/10/el-paso-crime-rate-topic-in-trump-roundtable-to-support-border-wall/2539838002/\">in a fact check</a>, said some form of barrier has existed between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez for decades, though Trump appeared to be referring to fencing that was completed in mid-2009: “Looking broadly at the last 30 years, the rate of violent crime reached its peak in 1993, when more than 6,500 violent crimes were recorded. Between 1993 and 2006, the number of violent crimes fell by more than 34 percent and less than 2,700 violent crimes were reported. The border fence was authorized by [president George W.] Bush in 2006, but construction did not start until 2008. From 2006 to 2011 — two years before the fence was built to two years after — the violent crime rate in El Paso increased by 17 percent.” The city had the third lowest violent crime rate among 35 U.S. cities with a population over 500,000 in 2005, 2006 and 2007 – before construction of a 57-mile-long fence started in mid-2008.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"8681, 8753, 8622, 8439, 7818, 7782","repeated_count":"6","date":"02/11/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
