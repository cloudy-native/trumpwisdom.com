And I heard this morning the real number is probably 70,000 -- 70,000 shuttered American factories. And he's talking about how wonderful it is with China.”","analysis":"Trump is likely referring to the number of U.S. factory closures and job losses since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, a talking point he often uses. The number for factory closures is accurate, but to suggest Biden alone pushed forward the changes or that China was the only factor is misleading. Economists say automation and other forces also played a role. The number for job losses is seriously exaggerated. Official government data show 4.3 million to 4.7 million U.S. manufacturing jobs were lost after China joined the WTO -- but, again, although China had a big role, it's misleading to blame it all on them.
