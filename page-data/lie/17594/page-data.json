There were seven cases, but one -- who says he is innocent and will fight the charges -- was released from custody. Five of the suspects are in the county jail pending trials — four of them held without bond on serious charges that preclude release. The remaining suspect, Nestor Lopez-Guzman, was in the Montgomery Detention Center on Aug. 19 when he gave notice he was about to post a $15,000 bond. ICE officials said they were able to take “custody of Lopez-Guzman pursuant to the detainer.” The next day, Lopez-Guzman posted an immigration bond and was released, pending further court or removal actions. County officials said that shows ICE has to follow the same laws.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
