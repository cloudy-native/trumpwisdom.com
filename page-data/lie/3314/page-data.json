The fact is, they had people in our campaign — they had people doing things that have never been done in the history of this country, and it really is a disgrace.  And frankly, that stuff is just starting to come out.”","analysis":"Trump is misquoting House Speaker Paul Ryan, who clearly stated that he thought (after a briefing by the FBI) that Trump's claim of a spy being implanted in his campaign were overblown.  It has been reported that an FBI informant in Europe, a professor named Stefan Halper, met with at least three people working on the Trump campaign in Europe. So far, there has been nothing to indicate whether there was a political agenda or a “spy” mandate as part of Halper's assistance for the FBI, which started after the agency opened a counterintelligence probe. Spies and confidential informants use different methods.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"23036, 22981, 22945, 22960, 22904, 22905, 22873, 22874, 22664, 22634, 22645, 22630, 19785, 19738, 19705, 19671, 19649, 19485, 19445, 17555, 17519, 17196, 16796, 16298, 15906, 15996, 15925, 15394, 14745, 13854, 15486, 12653, 11410, 12040, 11451, 11891, 11265, 11870, 11180, 11773, 11744, 11106, 11080, 10651, 10950, 10763, 10574, 10134, 10135, 10145, 10153, 10077, 9973, 9843, 8054, 5013, 4770, 3314, 3255, 3240, 3256, 3155, 3157, 3178, 3231, 3239, 3143, 3210","repeated_count":"68","date":"06/08/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
