I was asking the Air Force guys, I said, how good is this plane? They said, well, sir, you can't see it. I said, yeah, but in a fight -- you know, a fight -- like I watch in the movies -- they fight, they're fighting. How good is this? They say, well, it wins every time because the enemy cannot see it.”","analysis":"The F-35 jet uses stealth technology but this does not mean it is invisible or even that it cannot be detected by radar. According to the manufacturer, Lockheed Martin: \"Stealth is not invisibility. Rather, stealth gives the F-35 the ability to elude or greatly complicate an enemy’s ability to find and destroy an aircraft using a combination of design, tactics and technology.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"1939","repeated_count":"1","date":"11/23/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
