I like to do that; I'm one of these guys. I'm riding in this incredible car, and I'm driving, and I'm looking at gas stations to see how much is the gas.

I don't think so.”","analysis":"The president has little power to move prices at the gas pump in any direction because they depend on market forces beyond his control. A variety of market factors has contributed to the falling price of gasoline. Trump has previously suggested prices fell because of phone calls to foreign leaders in oil-rich countries, but that's a fallacy.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"27014, 26100, 25368, 24568, 20865, 22191, 7827, 8020, 7966, 7950, 7871","repeated_count":"11","date":"01/14/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
