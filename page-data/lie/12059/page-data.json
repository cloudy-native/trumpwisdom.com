Economists say that Trump's tariffs are dramatically raising costs for Americans and slowing economic growth. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/~reddings/papers/CEPR-DP13564.pdf\">A paper</a> published on March 2 by three prominent U.S. economists found \"that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018,\" they reported. \"We find that the U.S. tariffs were almost completely passed through into U.S. domestic prices, so that the entire incidence of the tariffs fell on domestic consumers and importers up to now, with no impact so far on the prices received by foreign exporters. We also find that U.S. producers responded to reduced import competition by raising their prices.\" Another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.econ.ucla.edu/pfajgelbaum/RTP.pdf\">paper</a>, published March 3 by a different set of economists, found similar results. \"Tradable-sector workers in heavily Republican counties are the most negatively affected by the trade war,\" the paper said. One of those studies pegged the cost of tariffs announced thus far (including the most recent escalation on $200 billion of Chinese goods) at $831 per U.S. household.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/15/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
