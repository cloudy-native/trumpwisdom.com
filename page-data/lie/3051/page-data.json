But Chicago has the toughest gun laws in our country. They're so tough.”","analysis":"This claim about the impact of Chicago’s gun laws on gun violence relies on outdated gun laws and shoddy data. The state of Illinois has tough gun laws, but several of the most restrictive laws, such as a ban on handguns and a gun registry, are no longer in use. And while the city may have high instances of gun violence, it does not have the highest rate of gun violence.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Guns","repeated_ids":"3051, 1866, 1598","repeated_count":"3","date":"05/04/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
