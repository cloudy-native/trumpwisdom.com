It’s going to be on my conscience, plus it’s going to anger a lot of people out there who called me a rat.” Moreover, Credico has a lifelong hatred of incarceration as a result of how it changed his father. He told the Times, “I would ask for leniency for Hannibal Lecter.” In other words, his plea had more to do with himself than Stone.
