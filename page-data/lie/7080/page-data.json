An alien simply crosses the border illegally, finds a Border Patrol agent, and using well-coached language -- by lawyers and others that stand there trying to get fees or whatever they can get -- they're given a phrase to read. They never heard of the phrase before. They don't believe in the phrase. But they're given a little legal statement to read, and they read it.”","analysis":"There is no magic phrase. An immigrant simply must request asylum for U.S. officials to consider the merits of the case. That's the law, not a loophole, and it covers immigrants who crossed legally or illegally into the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/01/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
