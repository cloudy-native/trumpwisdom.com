I agree!”","analysis":"Senior Trump administration officials, including the president’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, raised concerns about the administration’s dealings with Ukraine. The House intelligence committee gathered evidence that Trump withheld $391 million in security assistance funds for Ukraine while he pressed that country to publicly announce investigations into Joe Biden and into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukrainians and not Russians interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Both investigations stood to benefit Trump politically. The testimony of senior officials was corroborated by text messages, emails, documents, Trump’s own public remarks and a rough transcript of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Whether the evidence is enough to remove Trump from office is a question for the Senate. Trump falsely claims that the House is not accusing him of crimes. The articles of impeachment encompass attempted bribery and soliciting foreign assistance in a U.S. election -- both of which are alleged crimes.","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
