CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch is a Russia-born cyber and national security expert and a U.S. citizen; he is not Ukrainian. In any case, Mueller’s investigation confirmed CrowdStrike’s findings and even indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in 2018 for their role in the breach.Thomas P. Bossert, who served as Trump’s first homeland security adviser, said Sept. 29 that the president has been repeatedly told that the story has been “completely debunked,” yet Trump continues to embrace it. “The DNC server and that conspiracy theory has got to go,” Bossert said on ABC’s ‘This Week.” “If he continues to focus on that white whale, it’s going to bring him down.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
