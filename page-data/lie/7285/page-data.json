It will go up fast and save us BILLIONS of dollars a month once completed!”","analysis":"It's not clear what about the wall will save billions, but Trump regularly suggests stemming the flow of illegal immigrants will save billions. That claim orginiates in study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes immigration and has been criticized for its methodology, which critics say overstates costs and understates benefits. The FAIR report comes up with a annual $135 billion annual cost by using a high-end estimate for the number of undocumented immigrants and counting the benefits consumed by the children of illegal immigrants born in the U.S., who under law are U.S. citizens – but not the fiscal impact of the children of unauthorized immigrants once they become adults. Other analysts say the cost of illegal immigration is much lower, likely not more than 1/10th the FAIR figure.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"31494, 16480, 12997, 8455, 8358, 8037, 7887, 7925, 7658, 7668, 7645, 7271, 7285, 7566, 7264, 6699, 6782, 6932, 6965, 7118, 7155, 6809, 6600, 6765, 7072","repeated_count":"25","date":"12/18/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
