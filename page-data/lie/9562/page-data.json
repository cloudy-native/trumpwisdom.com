The dossier —essentially 16 reports — was supposed to be raw intelligence, not necessarily verified. The broad thrust of the material has held up, such as secret contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russians, according to recent evaluations by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/steele-dossier-retrospective\">Lawfare</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/07/politics/dossier-two-years-later/index.html\">CNN</a>, but key details appear to be wrong or unverified. Documents released by Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s office “buttress some of Steele’s reporting, both specifically and thematically. The dossier holds up well over time, and none of it, to our knowledge, has been disproven,” Lawfare said. “But much of the reporting simply remains uncorroborated.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"29793, 30463, 26500, 26298, 26320, 26074, 25663, 25938, 25821, 25116, 23000, 21075, 21709, 17181, 16380, 16365, 15903, 13880, 13057, 12907, 12956, 11657, 11674, 12241, 11860, 11862, 11871, 11772, 11765, 11745, 11010, 11087, 10917, 10748, 10791, 10442, 10452, 10658, 10773, 10569, 10576, 10392, 10536, 9863, 10078, 10018, 9969, 9739, 9562, 9233, 9180, 8914, 8702, 9459, 8547, 8346, 8512, 8516, 8114, 7747, 7710, 7279, 7429, 7270, 7214, 7171, 5555, 6074, 5590, 5391, 6060, 5025, 4734, 4735, 4611, 4680, 4501, 4384, 4467, 4331, 4269, 3954, 3662, 3630, 3643, 3617, 3444, 3313, 3322, 3249, 3137, 2985, 2948, 2943, 2724, 2604, 8933, 2308, 2308, 2034, 2106, 1983, 1983, 1979, 1891, 1891, 1898, 1965, 1539, 1539, 1568, 1568, 1412, 1412, 0010","repeated_count":"115","date":"03/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
