Trump's claim that \"gases are spewing into the atmosphere\" is correct only if the gases he's referring to are his own remarks. \"Overall, using wind to produce energy has fewer effects on the environment than many other energy sources,\" according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. \"Wind turbines do not release emissions that can pollute the air or water (with rare exceptions), and they do not require water for cooling. Wind turbines may also reduce the amount of electricity generation from fossil fuels, which results in lower total air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions.\" The most that can be said is that \"producing the metals and other materials used to make wind turbine components has impacts on the environment, and fossil fuels may have been used to produce the materials,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/wind/wind-energy-and-the-environment.php\">according to the EIA</a>.","pinocchios":"","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/21/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
