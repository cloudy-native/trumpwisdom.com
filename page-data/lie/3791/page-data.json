On July 3, Awan pleaded guilty to making a false statement on a bank loan application. The plea deal had nothing to do with his work on Capitol Hill, but federal prosecutors included an unusual passage that debunked several conspiracy theories about Awan’s work. Prosecutors said they found no evidence Awan “engaged in unauthorized or illegal conduct involving House computers systems.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/16/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
