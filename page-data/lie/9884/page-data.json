If you take a look at this, 180 million people will lose their private health insurance.”","analysis":"The Medicare for all plan promoted by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would eliminate private insurance but not all Democratic candidates or lawmakers support such an idea. Plus, while the plan would eliminate private plans, it would create a national health insurance. (The Census Bureau <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-264.pdf#page=10\">says</a> that in 2017, 217 million Americans had private insurance, with 181 million covered through an employer and 52 million directly purchasing it. Meanwhile, 123 million Americans are covered already through a government plan, such as Medicare, Medicaid or the military health system.)","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"20817, 22255, 17531, 17352, 17412, 14677, 13778, 13884, 13886, 13046, 13465, 13674, 13722, 12693, 11284, 9884, 9126, 8734, 7353, 7383, 6733, 6735, 6884, 6961, 6963, 7113, 7114, 7151, 6794, 6804, 6807, 6856, 6897, 6902, 6528, 6597, 6754, 6755, 7044, 7045, 6551, 6640, 6239, 5537, 5983, 6380, 6156, 6157, 6476, 5480, 5893, 5410, 5595, 5614, 5618, 5621, 5351, 5305, 5517, 5112, 5697","repeated_count":"61","date":"04/06/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
