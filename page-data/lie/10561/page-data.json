The Democrats are doing that.”","analysis":"It's false to claim Puerto Rico got $91 billion for disaster relief after Hurricane Maria. Democrats were onboard with Sen. David Perdue's disaster relief bill, according to Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.

The resulting bill excluded some Puerto Rico funding and Democrats were opposed.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"17204, 12613, 12145, 11332, 10598, 10560, 10561, 10850, 10379, 9632, 9799, 9474","repeated_count":"12","date":"05/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
