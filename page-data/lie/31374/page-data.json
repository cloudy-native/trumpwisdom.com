That's Detroit. One hundred and seventy-four thousand ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter. Nobody knows where they came from.”","analysis":"This claim by Trump is false, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2020/12/11/supreme-court-election-case-makes-false-claim-detroit-ballots/6509541002/\">according to The Detroit Free Press</a>. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, in a lawsuit that was dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court, sought to overturn Michigan's certified election results by using a flawed analysis that would have had the justices believe that all 174,384 absentee ballots cast in Detroit were invalid. The analysis misinterpreted the report of precinct-level results for Wayne County. The absentee ballots that were counted in Detroit were ones that had already been verified as coming from eligible voters before they were counted.\n","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/06/2021","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
