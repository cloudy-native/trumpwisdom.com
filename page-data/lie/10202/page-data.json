How this whole ridiculous 35-million-dollar unlimited personnel -- how this all started, I think you will find of great interest. Most of you know the answer to it anyway. The fair press, the good press, the -- really, the people that know what they're doing or the people that are indeed fair, they know the answer to it. So we're going to see.”","analysis":"There is no mystery about how the FBI's probe of possible contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign was started. It began because of a tip from an Australian diplomat, who said a Trump campaign official disclosed Russia had damaging emails concerning Hillary Clinton. Contrary to Trump's frequent suggestions, it was not prompted by memos generated by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent, on behalf of Democrats. Special Counsel Robert Mueller through September 2018 had reported $25.2 million in costs. Presumably, this figure will rise when the final costs are released. But Mueller also made money for the government, namely by seizing properties owned by former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Independent journalist Marcy Wheeler has estimated the value of Manafort’s seized assets at $46 million.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/26/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
