She wrote the report, and the goes, gives it to her husband who is at the DOJ, and then he goes and brings it to the FBI, and she's getting paid for doing it. It's incredible.”","analysis":"Trump attacks a career Justice Department official, who had contacts with British agent Christopher Steele and Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, which was hired by the Democrats to investigate Trump's ties in Russia. He suggests that this makes the process rigged when in fact Ohr was not officially involved in the Russian investigation. However, the DOJ Inspector General, in a 2019 report, criticized Ohr for not telling his superiors that he continued to relay information from Steele to the FBI after the FBI had cut ties with Steele. Ohr's wife, who worked at Fusion GPS, assisted in assembling Steele's dossier of reports on Trump. DOJ leadership, including Ohr’s supervisors and those who reviewed and approved the Page FISA applications, was not made aware of Ohr’s meetings with the FBI, Steele, Fusion GPS, or members of the State Department “until after Congress requested information from the Department regarding Ohr's activities in late November 2017,” the report said.  (The Fact Checker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/24/what-steele-dossier-said-vs-what-mueller-report-said/\">found</a> that special counsel Robert Mueller's report seemed to cast \"grave doubt\" on several parts of the dossier.)
