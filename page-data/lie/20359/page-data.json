I mean, Obama had his pockets picked, and as you know Putin did something that he shouldn't have done because he didn't respect Obama perhaps. And Obama got upset and the United States, said we don't want to be here if Putin's going to be there.”","analysis":"This is an absurd way to recall recent history. Russia invaded Crimea, a part of Ukraine, sparking outrage in the West, and the other seven G-8 member nations acted in concert to expel Russia from the group in 2014. Trump repeatedly claims that \"Putin took Crimea from Obama,\" and this remark about Obama throwing a tantrum and getting the other members of the G-8 to drop Russia is a version of the same tortured logic.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
