Countries are not \"sending\" anyone; it's mostly voluntary migration. Drug cartels, smugglers, gang members and coyotes do try to game the system. But many thousands of people from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are fleeing gang violence, sexual violence, threats to their safety or high poverty.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
