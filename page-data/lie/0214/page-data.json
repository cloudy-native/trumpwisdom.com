Only eight former Gitmo detainees \"confirmed of reengaging\" in terrorist or insurgent activities were released under Obama, and 113 were released under George W. Bush. Although this tweet, sent at 7:04 a.m., was immediately called out as false on Twitter, Trump repeated it on the @POTUS account at 8:03 a.m.  Trump tweeted this on the same day from @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS. Therefore, we are counting the two tweets as separate entries in our database.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"0216","repeated_count":"1","date":"03/07/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
