Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts), but they don't even want to take murderers into custody! What’s going on?”","analysis":"This is false. Democrats have never proposed allowing murderers to walk. It's also false because of the absurd scenario Trump describes. This tweet was a reference to border security negotiations. Democrats wanted to cap the number of detention beds for ICE as a way to impose an informal quota on detentions of undocumented immigrants. But ICE is not the agency detaining murderers. They mostly enforce civil immigration violations and handle deportations. Anyone charged with or convicted of homicide is detained by law enforcement agencies apart from ICE, such as state or local police or the FBI, and held in custody regardless of how many beds ICE has at its disposal.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"8675, 8696, 8700, 8737, 8660, 8665","repeated_count":"6","date":"02/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
