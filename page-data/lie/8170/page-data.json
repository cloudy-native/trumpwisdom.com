That was the Houston arena. That was an incredible night, right? And we had, I think, 109,000 or 106,000 people wanting to come. They had thousands outside. And that was a few weeks before the election.”","analysis":"According to the Houston police chief, Art Acevedo, 18,000 to 19,000 were in the venue for Trump’s rally and 3,000 watched on a big screen outside. The Dallas Morning News reported, \"Many hundreds of seats were empty, including all of the boxes on both tiers of the mezzanine.” Trump’s campaign claimed 109,000 people registered for tickets to this Houston rally. But this is not a measure of the actual crowd size. Anyone could go online and register for two free tickets.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"30333, 30165, 30318, 29414, 28355, 28722, 29019, 27930, 27696, 27032, 26742, 26792, 26724, 27263, 26902, 27177, 25959, 25981, 25783, 25085, 23634, 21885, 21762, 19473, 18482, 18066, 18116, 18388, 17422, 17471, 18337, 17282, 17356, 16500, 16455, 16270, 16277, 16321, 14959, 14323, 14653, 15059, 15092, 13783, 13238, 12469, 12449, 12381, 11602, 11671, 12091, 12108, 12020, 12021, 11930, 11873, 11874, 11165, 11768, 11157, 10588, 10628, 10696, 10544, 10854, 10225, 9499, 9091, 9093, 9094, 9153, 8286, 8170, 7012, 7013, 7434, 7460, 6704, 6705, 6708, 6868, 6944, 7095, 6662, 6524, 6758, 6217, 6247, 6328, 6336, 6346, 6408, 6169, 5488, 5871, 5889, 5446, 5559, 6064, 5076, 5560, 5575, 5502, 5507, 5189, 5235, 5236, 5237, 5179, 5180","repeated_count":"110","date":"01/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
