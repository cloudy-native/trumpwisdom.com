It shouldn't be extended because people need more time. No, the people, they need more time, let them put their ballots at a week early. There's plenty of time to put your ballots in. And let 'em go in a week early. But to extend a date for, it could be Tuesday. It's, you know, I mean, there's, uh, there, there's different ways of interpreting things. But with Pennsylvania, there's no question about it. And they've gotten an extension. And the extension, there was a gentleman on one of the shows, and we're gonna actually put it out. Last night, a very successful pollster. Somebody that's actually called it very accurately. And he and others were talking about the fact that this will lead to almost-guaranteed fraud. And it's, it's almost like putting the leaders of Pennsylvania, uh, and the counters on an honor code. Well, an honor code, I know those people. An honor code is not acceptable to us. I'm not, there can't be an honor code. Because there's not a lot of honor. And what they have is a system that's going to delay the election.","analysis":"There is no legal requirement that mandates the immediate reporting of all election results in the country; delayed counting is unavoidable when so many people are avoiding election lines during the pandemic. Plenty of presidential elections have remained unsettled on election night, some for days or weeks. Trump baselessly suggests Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, and officials in the Democratic stronghold of Philadelphia will manipulate the vote count, laying the groundwork for his many unsuccessful challenges to contest his loss in the state.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/03/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
