Little of significance has happened in the fight against the islamic State terror group in the first six weeks of Trump's term, compared to the steady progress made in recent years to roll back its territory. In the past year, Islamic State has lost eastern Mosul and the Iraq cities of Fallujah, Ramadi, and a number of towns along the Tigris River. Iraqi troops also took Makhmour and Qayyarah, establishing bases for the attack on Mosul.
