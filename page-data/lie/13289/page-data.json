Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt.

No good!.... ....And by the way, I'm the best thing that’s ever happened to Puerto Rico!”","analysis":"This is a stunning wholesale indictment from the president of the political system of a U.S. territory. Congress appropriated relief funds for Puerto Rico after it was badly wrecked by Hurricane Maria, and his assertion that all of it went to crooked politicians is false.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
