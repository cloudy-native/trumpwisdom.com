Trudeau said Canada had a total trade deficit with the United States while Trump insisted it was the other way around. In reality, the U.S. goods trade deficit with Canada was $12.1 billion in 2016, but the U.S. services trade surplus with Canada was $24.6 billion in 2016, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/canada\">according to the U.S. Trade Representative</a>. That is an overall surplus of about $12 billion. So Trudeau was right, according to U.S. government data.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"9678, 4800, 4807, 5010, 3696, 3872, 3942, 3399, 3349, 3341, 3303, 2617, 2806, 2585, 2449, 2423, 2276, 2073, 1956, 1854, 2115, 2145, 0520, 2113, 2116","repeated_count":"25","date":"12/08/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
