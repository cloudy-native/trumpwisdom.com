The penalty was relatively small and many health-care experts thought it should have been higher. For people who bought insurance on the Obamacare exchanges and qualified for subsidies, the monthly premiums were generally under $100. Trump often falsely says this move ended Obamacare to suggest he kept his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act. But the law remains intact and has popular support. Moreover, it turned out the mandate was not an especially important motivator for people to buys health insurance.
