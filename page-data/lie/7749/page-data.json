No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!”","analysis":"President Trump previously had said he would be \"proud\" to take responsibility for shutting down the government if Congress did not appropriate the $5 billion in funds he requested for a border wall. Then he agreed to a temporary resolution that cleared the Senate on a voice vote. But under pressure from the right, Trump suddenly changed his mind and demanded a vote in the House for $5 billion, even though the votes for the bill did not exist in the Senate. He now insists Democrats are to blame. Media reports indicated the administration was unaware that the Coast Guard could not be paid during the shutdown until a fix was found using $75 million in unused funds.
