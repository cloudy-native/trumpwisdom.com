But we’re going to see what happens. The playing field has to be level for everybody. That’s very important.”","analysis":"Amazon says that its contracts with the post office are mutually beneficial and that federal regulators have found them to be profitable for the post office. The U.S. Postal Service saw a net loss of $2.7 billion in fiscal 2017, driven by factors such as declining flat-mail volume and pension and health benefit liabilities. But its line of business for shipping and packages has been a bright spot in recent years. To comply with federal law, the Postal Service in 2017 had to generate at least $1.6 billion in income from its “competitive products,” which includes Amazon package deliveries. Instead, it generated $6.8 billion, according to a 2017 compliance report.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"04/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
