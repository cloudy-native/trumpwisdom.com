A better measure of popularity is an average of polls. The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/?ex_cid=rrpromo\">538 website</a> on this day showed that Trump had an average approval rating of 37.7 percent, which reflects the inclusion of the Rasmussen poll. By contrast, Obama had an approval rating of 49.6 percent on the 343rd day of his presidency. Moreover, Trump had a disapproval rating of 56.4 percent, compared to 43.8 percent for Obama.
