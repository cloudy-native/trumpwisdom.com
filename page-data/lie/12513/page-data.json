In fact, it was because they annexed Crimea. You know that. They're still there. Why would you let them back in?’] That was outsmarting Obama. So, Russia outsmarted President Obama. They took over during his term, not during mine -- Crimea. They took over Crimea. If you'd stop being an organ of the Democrats -- I mean, you know, if you'd let me answer the question. … The fact is, President Putin totally outsmarted President Obama on Crimea and other things, including the red line in the sand, all right? He outsmarted -- he made a living on outsmarting President Obama. And frankly, because of it, Obama was upset and he got Obama out of what was the G8 into the G7. It's come up: Should we put Russia back in? We spend a lot of time talking about Russia at those meetings.”","analysis":"Trump presents a warped history, blaming President Obama for Russia's hostilities in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea. In fact, it was Russian aggression, and in response Obama rallied the international community to impose sanctions on Russia, and NATO countries began spending more on their defense. Trump would like to reward Russia by inviting it back to the G-7.
