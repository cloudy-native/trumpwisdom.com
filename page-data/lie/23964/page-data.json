Because the swine flu was not nearly as lethal as the novel coronavirus, there was not nearly as much need to halt its spread. Even with 60 million infections, there were an estimated 12,500 deaths. (Note: That was an after-the-fact report, based on statistical modeling of excess mortality. The death toll at the time was much lower.) A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/02/health/02flu.html\">New York Times assessment</a> in 2010 noted that some flaws in the system were discovered, but overall the Obama administration was praised for its response — in part because it turned out that the pandemic was not as severe as it once had appeared. The President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology in August 2009 had forecast 30,000 to 90,000 deaths, and the final death toll was much less than that.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
