So they really, in a sense, were voting to destroy Puerto Rico. … They changed the tax situation; they ripped it out. So they really ripped apart the island.”","analysis":"Trump often makes it seem as if Biden single-handedly destroyed Puerto Rico's pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. That's highly misleading. In 1996, Biden, then a senator, joined all of the Senate Democrats voting and a majority of its Republicans, who controlled the Senate at the time, in voting for a wide-ranging bill focused largely on small businesses. In what was seen at the time as a blow against \"corporate welfare,\" the bill phased out a tax exemption for companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. The legislation also raised the minimum wage. The final Senate vote on the bill, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, was 76-22. (Barack Obama had no role, but sometimes Trump blames \"Obama-Biden.\") While the island’s drug manufacturing was harmed by the bill, it was not entirely “shut down” or “obliterated,” as Trump often says.
