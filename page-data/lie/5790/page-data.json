Total Phony!”","analysis":"Blumenthal on a few occasions before his first Senate race in 2010 said or implied he had served in Vietnam, when he hadn't. But Trump seems to have fabricated a bunch of anecdotes and statements that Blumenthal never uttered. It was not 12 years, Blumenthal never described himself as a war hero and never talked about any near-death battles.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"25635, 25788, 25790, 7551, 6877, 6955, 5428, 5342, 5318, 5319, 5799, 5800, 5801, 5187, 5199, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5790","repeated_count":"19","date":"09/29/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
