They'll be able to forge ballots. They'll forge them.”","analysis":"Experts say it would be almost impossible to successfully counterfeit the ballots being prepared for November’s general election. State election officials use multiple safeguards to verify that mail ballots are authentic. Most states have bar codes printed on their mail ballots. When a completed ballot arrives, election officials scan the barcode to link it with the corresponding voter in the system. Duplicate ballots from the same voter wouldn’t be recognized by the system. In addition, voters must follow specific instructions to return a ballot received in the mail, such as signing an affidavit. Officials typically compare the signature on the ballot with the one in the registration and may discard ballots with mismatched signatures. Dozens of graphical details, candidate names, official seals, check boxes and bar codes would have to be copied perfectly, on dozens of different ballot designs — and that’s for each jurisdiction in the United States. On top of that, the hypothetical foreign nation would have to identify registered voters (who had not already voted by mail) and somehow forge their signatures.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"24464, 24323, 22877, 22735","repeated_count":"4","date":"07/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
