A Ford worker in Michigan came up with the rough concept after visiting Chicago and seeing a slaughterhouse where carcasses were taken apart step-by-step on a conveyor belt. Between 1908 and 1913, Ford workers finessed that idea into an auto assembly line. Another Michigander, Ransom Olds, had invented the stationary assembly line years earlier. But Trump is correct that the Ford factory was in Michigan.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
