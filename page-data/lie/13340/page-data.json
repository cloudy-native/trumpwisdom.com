They can't believe what's happening. Where our policeman that are on the beat are getting sick. They're actually sick. They're going to the hospital. We can't let that happen.”","analysis":"There's quite a lot going on here. Trump starts by making the grossly exaggerated claim that California cities could \"destroy themselves\" by allowing homelessness. Then he makes the highly dubious claim that foreign tenants are considering leaving the country because of homelessness in California cities. Then he claims police are getting sick from coming into contact with the homeless, apparently based on a single incident. A police union said three Los Angeles police officers contracted a Staph infection after attending a homeless individual at a police station. \"But Dr. Brad Spellberg, chief medical officer at LAC+USC Medical Center, said it’s unfair – and inaccurate – to pin blame on any one source,\" a local CBS affiliate <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/05/07/lapd-mrsa-infection-reseda-west-valley-station/\">reported</a>.

It’s everywhere around us.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/17/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
