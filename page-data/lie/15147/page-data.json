[quoting a tweet that reads, ‘Here's what it looks like when Democrats are being honest: “I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected.”’]”","analysis":"Trump appears to be referring to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/05/06/al_green_im_concerned_if_we_dont_impeach_this_president_he_will_get_re-elected.html\">a comment made by Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) on MSNBC on May 6</a>, 2019 when he was asked whether impeaching Trump would help him win re-election, given that polling at the time showed most Americans opposed: “I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get re-elected. If we don't impeach him, he will say he’s been vindicated. He will say the Democrats had an overwhelming majority in the House and didn't take up impeachment. He will say we have a constitutional duty to do it if it was there and we didn’t. He will say he’s been vindicated.”\nIn other words, Trump is twisting Green’s comment to suggest he said impeachment is necessary to defeat him because otherwise the Democrats could not beat him. But that’s not how Green framed it. He was saying a failure to impeach Trump would allow him to pitch himself as vindicated. The Texas congressman <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/RepAlGreen/status/1172184120643874816\">said on Twitter</a>: “It’s no surprise that @realDonaldTrump, who promoted birther conspiracies about President Obama, who claimed there were nice people among the bigots and racists in Charlottesville, and who consistently engages in perfidy, would tweet another untruth. I never said that.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Ukraine probe","repeated_ids":"16759, 16794, 16674, 15993, 15410, 14478, 14167, 14201, 15147, 14522, 12780","repeated_count":"11","date":"10/19/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
