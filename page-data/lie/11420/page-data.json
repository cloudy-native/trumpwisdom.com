All three countries were only allocated $88 million in aid in 2018, down from a combined total of $499 million in 2016. (It increased slightly in Fiscal 2019 to $186 million in combined aid.)The aid is intended to improve the economy and government functions in these countries, in the hopes that lives will improve for citizens and fewer will feel the need to flee.

The partnership between the two countries drew praise from diplomats, members of Congress and even America’s top border enforcement official. In the past three years, both El Salvador’s homicide rate and migration flows have declined sharply. More than 72,000 Salvadorans were apprehended crossing the U.S. border in 2016. By 2018, the number had plummeted by more than half, to fewer than 32,000.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"21434, 16207, 11358, 11420, 9649, 9605, 8975, 8445, 8589, 8328, 8118, 8192, 7879, 7926, 7741","repeated_count":"15","date":"07/16/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
