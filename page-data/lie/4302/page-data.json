What do I read? They've been working on this stuff for 75 years. Obama didn't do anything. In all fairness, other administrations did nothing. They've been working on it for so many decades. What do I read? I left three months ago. 'Donald Trump isn't moving fast enough.'”","analysis":"Leave aside the small flub that North Korea was founded in 1948, or 70 years ago. All recent presidents tried to deal with North Korea. Bill Clinton negotiated a nuclear agreement with North Korea that froze its plutonium program and was working on a missile deal. But that agreement fell apart under George W. Bush. But then Bush tried to negotiate a deal, even lifting sanctions on North Korea. But those tentative agreements fell apart as well and Obama was unable to make much more progress.
