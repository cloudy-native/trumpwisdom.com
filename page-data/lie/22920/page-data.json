He has said he would return to the Obama-era policy of prioritizing gang members and those convicted of violent crimes -- a policy Trump rescinded shortly before he began to separate families at the border. Many of the people ICE arrests and Trump calls \"criminal aliens\" are convicted of immigration offenses, not \"rape and murder\" or such violent crimes.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/12/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
