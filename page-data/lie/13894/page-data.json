And we were having big trouble with one country — first week in office, very early. He said, ‘Sir, we have no ammunition.’ I said: ‘You know what? We're going to have ammunition — a lot of it. And hopefully we'll never going to have to use it, but we have a lot of it.’ But I also said, ‘I never want to have another president of the United States to hear those words from a general.’ ”","analysis":"Trump is onto something when he suggests that munitions were running low at the time he took office. After targeting Islamic State operatives with tens of thousands of smart bombs and guided missiles, U.S. military officials began to say publicly that stockpiles were growing thin. But the president’s disregard for details and accuracy gets him in trouble. Trump never limits his comments to PGMs and instead gives the impression that all ammunition was running out. Smart bombs may be the most important kind in the fight against terror, but it’s nevertheless an exaggerated claim. Moreover, at times Trump’s claim has morphed from “very little” ammunition to “no ammunition.” No military official has claimed that munitions, whether PGMs or for any other kind of weapon, were depleted, and officials in the Obama administration had already started to fix the problem by the time he took office.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"30982, 30943, 29444, 29540, 30027, 28582, 28808, 28172, 27690, 27852, 27913, 27734, 28247, 26849, 27147, 27512, 26398, 26476, 26107, 25707, 25730, 25529, 25366, 19576, 18770, 18739, 19492, 19200, 18600, 18140, 17758, 18556, 18546, 18044, 16261, 15801, 14776, 15703, 14114, 14641, 14010, 13894, 13895, 13877, 13567, 13893, 13634, 13681, 6442","repeated_count":"49","date":"10/12/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
