But the FBI did not discover the Trump campaign \"did absolutely nothing wrong.\" In fact, the special counsel's report, released in April 2019, concluded the Trump campaign welcomed the assistance from Russia even if it did not coordinate with it:  “Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
