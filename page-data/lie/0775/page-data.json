Indeed, apprehensions have declined dramatically, despite seasonal trends. While the decline can be attributed in part to his anti-illegal immigration rhetoric on the campaign trail, the numbers are less impressive when you compare them to the first full month under the Trump presidency. From February 2017 (the first full month of his presidency) through June 2017, apprehensions only declined 8 percent. Further, apprehensions are increasing again after bottoming out in April.
