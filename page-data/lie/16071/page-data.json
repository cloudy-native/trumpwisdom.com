It is not a matter of \"lost\" money or \"trillions of dollars\" being \"ripped from our nation.\" A trade deficit simply means that people in one country are buying more goods from another country than people in the second country are buying from the first country. Trade deficits are also affected by macroeconomic factors, such as currencies, economic growth, and savings and investment rates. Adding tariffs to imports from Canada, does not mean Canadians are paying more. Tariffs are taxes and those taxes are generally passed on to consumers — in this case American consumers. Plus, Trump’s suggestion that NATO members \"owe\" money to the United States or are \"delinquent\" is simply not the case. NATO members are supposed to meet a guideline of spending at least two percent of their gross domestic product on defense by 2024.
