The great Vietnam hero, right? Great Vietnam hero. Right? You know all about that, except he never went to Vietnam. And he stood up and he said, I don't want any lies, I only want the truth. This guy lied for 15 years about his -- Da Nang, right? Da Nang province. When I was climbing up the hill with Da Nang, I was climbing up the hill. And my soldiers were going down left and right. He never saw Vietnam. He was in the Reserves. Not bad, Reserves. He never saw Vietnam. He was climbing up the hill. Bullets left and right. My buddies going down. And then he wants honesty.”","analysis":"Blumenthal on a few occasions before his first Senate race in 2010 said or implied he had served in Vietnam, when he hadn't. But Trump seems to have fabricated a bunch of anecdotes and statements that Blumenthal never uttered. It was not 12 years, Blumenthal never described himself as a war hero and never talked about any near-death battles.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"25635, 25788, 25790, 7551, 6877, 6955, 5428, 5342, 5318, 5319, 5799, 5800, 5801, 5187, 5199, 5277, 5278, 5279, 5790","repeated_count":"19","date":"11/05/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
