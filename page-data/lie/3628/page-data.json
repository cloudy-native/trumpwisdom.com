Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!”","analysis":"Trump has often misleadingly claimed the “witch hunt” is tainted because of conflicts of interest, such as an unverified (and denied) dispute over golf fees when Mueller was a member of a Trump golf club. Eleven out of 16 attorneys on Mueller's team have contributed to Democrats, including Clinton and Obama; 13 are registered Democrats. Under federal law, Mueller is not allowed to consider the political leanings of his staff when hiring them, but he took action against a former team member when texts expressing anti-Trump sentiments were discovered.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"29797, 30459, 28072, 25594, 24537, 23434, 20513, 17112, 17187, 16091, 16463, 16006, 15481, 14358, 14415, 13759, 13842, 13611, 12957, 13677, 12149, 12039, 12029, 11944, 11863, 11169, 11189, 11774, 11116, 11095, 10915, 10746, 10728, 10717, 10437, 10958, 10960, 10537, 10541, 10542, 10932, 10129, 10283, 9953, 10146, 10149, 10114, 9764, 10021, 10073, 9917, 9824, 9738, 9740, 9346, 9085, 8702, 8050, 7582, 7583, 7584, 7269, 7266, 6580, 6535, 7516, 7211, 7213, 6999, 7452, 5056, 5057, 5040, 5969, 4818, 4756, 4497, 4357, 4406, 4479, 4383, 4469, 4274, 4532, 3611, 3628, 3647, 3388, 3421, 3920, 3930, 3289, 3291, 3241, 3242, 3180, 3248, 3062, 3041, 2944, 2614, 0723","repeated_count":"102","date":"07/21/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
