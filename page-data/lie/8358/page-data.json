DHS”","analysis":"The president seems to be relying on a chart he saw on television — which is odd considering he has access to more information than anyone else on Earth. And then, he apparently misunderstood one number in a chart, assuming “aliens” meant “illegal aliens.\" But \"aliens\" can refer to any immigrant — legal or illegal. Plus, there are wide ranging debates about the cost of illegal immigration and there is no exact count of undocumented immigrants. If you do the math, Trump estimates that each undocumented immigrant costs the United States $8,545 a year, or more than $220 billion. But that number is far too high to be credible.
