The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a “plea deal” to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server?

The case surrounding Imran Awan and his wife has been the subject of interest among conservatives and conspiracy theorists for more than a year. They were charged last year with conspiring to commit bank fraud and making false statements on a loan application and unlawful monetary transactions. But conservatives have suggested the couple were engaged in something much worse because Awan was an IT specialist for House lawmakers. An internal review found he and colleagues seemed to be bending rules on computer network access so they could share job duties. The Justice Department has debunked several conspiracy theories fanned by right-wing websites about Awan's work in Congress.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/07/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
