I don't want them to compete. They should be calling us and we can work it so they get the ventilators and they get shipped directly. If they're competing, if they're calling, even if there’s only two of them calling, they're going to just drive up the price because as nice as some of the people are that do ventilators, they do want to make money, okay?”","analysis":"A shortage of ventilators and personal protective equipment for health-care workers (masks, gowns, gloves and the like) has caused consternation among local leaders and medical professionals. Because supplies are limited, states have had to compete and outbid each other for what’s available on the market. One way to short-circuit the problem, according to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and others, is for Trump to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up manufacturing of these supplies and allocate them to the places that need them. Trump has been reluctant to use his full powers under the law.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/31/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
