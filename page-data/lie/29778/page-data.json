Same ideology...and now they don't have water. They don't have food. They don't have medicine. It's a very sad situation. It can happen here, just much, much bigger, but it can happen here with these maniacs....We will never be a socialist nation. That's what we're talking about. Oh, you're going to be a large scale version, very large scale of Venezuela.”","analysis":"This is a nonsense fear tactic. Trump's claim originates with the Democrats who have embraced some socialist policies. While Venezuela is governed by socialist leaders, its status as an increasingly failed state follows years of dictatorship and economic mismanagement, not simply a few socialist policies.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"31162, 29778, 29408, 28637, 28590, 28130, 28260, 27672, 26672, 26699, 21577, 22542, 9759, 9589, 6795, 6857, 6634, 6315, 5077, 6465, 5922, 5620, 5301, 5198","repeated_count":"24","date":"11/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
