They wanna have catch and, you know what catch and release is? You catch them, they're a murderer, they're a rapist, and you release them. You know where you release them? Into our country. Then Biden, at the debate, he said, 'No, no, it's okay 'cause they come back for court.' Nobody comes back. They don't come back. They don't. No I ended catch and release. I didn't like catching a murderer and releasing him.”","analysis":"We are not entirely clear what Trump is trying to say here, but he appears to be mashing together a couple separate immigration issues. The first, which he calls ‘catch and release’ applies when someone first appeals for asylum. Following the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees: A refugee enters and makes a petition, and the government makes a ruling after analyzing the facts. It's also worth keeping in mind that 85 percent of all deportations in the United States are ordered quickly, without a hearing before a judge. (Justice Department data show the vast majority of non-detained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings. For asylum-seekers, data suggests the return rate is even higher.) The second issue is when states and local governments do not alert federal authorities about people who may be in the country illegally. Some criminals have been released in jurisdictions that don't comply with ICE detainer requests, but although the research is limited, there is little difference in crime rates between cities that comply with requests and those that don't.
