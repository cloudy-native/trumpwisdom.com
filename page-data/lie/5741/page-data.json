And the steel mills need metallurgic coal, and those coal miners are working and the steel workers are working, and our whole country is working.”","analysis":"This is mostly baloney. The U.S. has added nearly 2,000 coal mining jobs since Trump took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's a drop in the bucket when measured against the 125,000-job loss in this industry since its most recent peak in 1985, or the 36,000-job loss since 2012. Coal mines are not opening up all over the place and neither are steel mills. Candidate Trump promised to revitalize these industries, but he has barely moved the needle.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"16991, 16185, 14993, 13244, 11466, 7442, 6725, 6676, 6616, 6743, 7021, 7063, 6121, 6123, 5876, 5582, 5741, 5104, 4988, 4865, 4484, 2559, 2373, 1210, 1122, 1023, 0895, 0966, 0850","repeated_count":"29","date":"09/29/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
