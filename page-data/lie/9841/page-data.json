They have a piece of paper. \"Read what that is.\" And all of the sudden, you're entitled to asylum.”","analysis":"This is eerily similar to a claim from Attorney General Jeff Sessions when he claimed that \"dirty immigration lawyers\" were coaching their clients to cite credible fear as the reason they were crossing the border. But here's the thing. The data show that people from Central America, where violence and humanitarian abuses have surged, make up most of the credible fear claims. About 80 percent of the time, a trained immigration official ruled that the cases are legitimate, requiring a court ruling. There's no concrete evidence to suggest there's weight to this clam.","pinocchios":"3","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"10304, 10047, 9905, 9841, 9891, 9781","repeated_count":"6","date":"04/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
