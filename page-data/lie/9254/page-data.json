Since that point, violent crime across the country has declined. In fact, in 2015, the violent crime rate was lower than it has been in almost 45 years, and lower than it has been for most of the 2000s save for 2013 and 2014. The violent crime rate increased in 2016, but it was still lower than any year between 1970 and 2013. And while Trump brags about the rate in 2017, the rate was not significantly different than 2016 — a decline of less than one percent.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/04/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
