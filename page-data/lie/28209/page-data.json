There were about 307,000 records of veterans who were marked as “pending” in a health-care database who had already died, according to their Social Security records. Some media outlets misreported what that meant. Given all the limitations in the database, it’s impossible to know whether those veterans had died before or after the VA began its health-care enrollment system, or whether they had applied for health care. Investigators found significant weaknesses in the data system that render the health enrollment database “virtually unreliable.”","pinocchios":"3","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"29043, 28209, 25633, 25805, 26017","repeated_count":"5","date":"10/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
