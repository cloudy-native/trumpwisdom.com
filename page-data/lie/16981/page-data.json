I'm not willing to do that. I'm not willing to do that. We'd win that so quickly your head would spin. And I'm not talking about nuclear; I'm talking about very conventional. But I'm not willing to kill millions of people.”","analysis":"There is little evidence that a massive conventional attack on Afghanistan, resulting in the deaths of millions of people, would lead to any victory. The U.S. has had a presence in Afghanistan for 18 years. Trump’s suggestion would wipe out one-third of the Afghani population, which would be a shocking and unprecedented world event indistinguishable from genocide. Still, there’s no guarantee that such an extreme move would ultimately lead to a stable Afghanistan.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/18/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
