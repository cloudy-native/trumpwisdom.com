Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump’s campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. Mueller concluded Russian government actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from people associated with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations, and then publicly disseminated those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks, to sow discord in the United States, hurt Clinton and help Trump. “Although the investigation established that the Russian government perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency and worked to secure that outcome, and that the Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities,\" the special counsel’s report says. Mueller declined to reach a decision on whether to bring charges against Trump for obstructing justice. The special counsel also did not make an explicit recommendation to Congress on impeachment. But Mueller spent nearly half of the report laying out a sustained effort by Trump to derail the investigation, including an effort by the president to have Mueller removed. “If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,” the report says. “Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President’s actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” In 2019, in a separate case involving separate evidence, the House impeached Trump after gathering significant evidence from senior Trump administration national security officials and diplomats who said Trump attempted to bribe Ukraine into announcing two investigations into Democrats in exchange for $391 million in security assistance funds that had been approved by Congress. The Government Accountability Office found that Trump broke the law when the White House placed repeated holds on the funds at his direction.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/14/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
