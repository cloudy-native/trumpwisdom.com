But Fauci, in an interview with ABC's \"This Week.,\" did not say schools shouldn't have closed — or that they should all immediately reopen. \"Close the bars and keep the schools open, is what we really say,\" Fauci said. \"Obviously, you don't have one size fits all. But as I said in the past … the default position should be to try as best as possible, within reason, to keep the children in school or to get them back to school.\" When \"you look at the data,\" Fauci said, transmission \"among children and from children is not really very big at all, not like one would have suspected.\" He added that while officials should \"try to get the kids back,\" the swiftest way for schools to reopen safely is to first contain the community spread of the disease. His comments were consistent with long-standing guidance guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and did not represent a change in position.
