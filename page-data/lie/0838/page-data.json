Here’s something where you walk up and say, I want my insurance.'”","analysis":"It's unclear what Trump is referring to; he appears to be describing something similar to life insurance or Social Security. Of course, that's not how health insurance works. A 21-year-old doesn't pay into health insurance to collect at 70, but rather contributes to a risk pool that helps pay for the premiums of more costly people in the same risk pool.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/19/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
