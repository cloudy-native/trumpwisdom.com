So you really don't have a deal. You know, that deal was a very short-term deal. So they made a deal, but it was for a very short period of time.”","analysis":"The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, as the Iran nuclear deal is formally known, actually bars Iran from ever seeking, developing or acquiring nuclear weapons; that element of the deal does not expire. Trump is alluding to the argument that some restrictions in the deal sunset over time and that Iran could pursue a nuclear weapons program in secret once those restrictions are gone.
