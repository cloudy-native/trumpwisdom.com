Black unemployment is at the lower level in history. Hispanic unemployment is at the lowest level in recorded history.”","analysis":"This is a flip-flop. During the 2016 campaign, Trump used to claim a Four-Pinocchio stat that 58 percent of African-American youth was unemployed. The official Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate for black youth at the time was 19.2 percent — about one-third of the rate used by Trump. Now that he’s president, Trump appears all too happy to cite the official unemployment rate for African Americans. But as of this event, black unemployment had risen from its recent low, so the president's claim was no longer accurate.","pinocchios":"","category":"Jobs","repeated_ids":"12533, 12344, 10056, 9939, 9803, 9290, 9309, 3724, 3754, 3882, 3868, 3812, 3592, 3829, 3472, 3517, 3374, 3359, 3300, 3392, 3405, 3330, 3168, 3191, 3206, 3069, 3044, 2966, 2956, 2937, 2769, 2704, 2669, 2735, 2723, 2564, 2507, 2432, 2312, 2260, 2221, 2285, 2303, 2352, 2206, 2184, 2162, 2154, 2117, 2127, 2141, 2047, 2009, 2014, 2010, 1126, 1139","repeated_count":"57","date":"02/12/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
