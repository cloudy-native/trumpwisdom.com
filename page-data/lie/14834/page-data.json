But for two and a half years, I've had to listen. This was their talking point, Trump and Russia.”","analysis":"This claim is unfounded. President Obama did not absolve Russian President Vladimir Putin of interfering in the U.S. presidential election in 2016, unlike Trump, who sided with Putin over the U.S. intelligence community in a news conference in Helsinki in 2018. Just weeks before the election, the Obama administration announced that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee. On Dec. 29, 2016, Obama imposed sanctions, including the expulsion of some three dozen Russian diplomats and intelligence officials and the closure of diplomatic compounds. Obama led an international coalition to sanction Russia after it invaded Crimea in 2014. Trump, by contrast, resisted congressional efforts to sanction Russia and has led a charge to weaken NATO and the European Union -- two important goals of Putin.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"28750, 25665, 25722, 25380, 24994, 24918, 24524, 24201, 23553, 22316, 21861, 22745, 22679, 21659, 20921, 20779, 20462, 20487, 19972, 19710, 19622, 19502, 18574, 16020, 14834, 12952, 12099, 12238, 11777, 10756, 10691, 10411, 10133, 10069, 9567, 8470, 8051, 8133, 7672, 4303, 3656, 2984, 2947, 2931, 2784, 2821, 2837, 2473, 2400, 2402, 2401, 2444","repeated_count":"52","date":"11/22/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
