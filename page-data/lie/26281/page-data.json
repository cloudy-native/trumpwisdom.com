Published in the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the study compared 154 people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus with 160 people who tested negative. The top finding was that “close contact with a person with known COVID-19 was more commonly reported among” the positive cases (42 percent) than the negatives (14 percent). Coronavirus-positive patients were more likely to have reported dining at a restaurant (any area designated by the restaurant, including indoor, patio and outdoor seating) “in the 2 weeks preceding illness onset” than those who tested negative, the study says. The study says that in the 14 days before illness onset, 71 percent of the positive cases and 74 percent of those who didn't catch the virus “reported always using cloth face coverings or other mask types when in public.” The rate of mask-wearing is almost the same, so the takeaway from this study is that the positive cases had more contacts with a person known to be infected with the virus and dined out more. “Exposures and activities where mask use and social distancing are difficult to maintain, including going to places that offer onsite eating or drinking, might be important risk factors for acquiring COVID-19. As communities reopen, efforts to reduce possible exposures at locations that offer on-site eating and drinking options should be considered to protect customers, employees, and communities,” the study says.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"26179, 26253, 26281, 26022","repeated_count":"4","date":"10/15/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
