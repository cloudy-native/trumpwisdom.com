I'll give you a couple of quick numbers. So under President Bush, for eight years, you saved $450, meaning you took in four $450. Okay, fine. Under President Obama, you took in $975. Under President Trump, including the energy savings and the regulation savings and the tax cuts savings, it’s more than $10,000 in less than three years.”","analysis":"Trump is mixing up all kinds of apples and oranges for maximum spin. One component, the claim that households are saving $3,000 a year from regulatory cuts, is worth Three Pinocchios just by itself. The president never mentions actions taken by the administration that have reduced household income. For instance, Federal Reserve Bank of New York officials peg Trump’s tariffs as already costing the typical U.S. household $831 a year.","pinocchios":"","category":"Economy","repeated_ids":"28798, 28980, 26439, 26247, 26167, 25851, 25037, 24606, 21999, 22928, 22187, 22832, 18464, 18070, 17029, 17501, 18257, 18286, 16834, 18195, 16743, 16715, 16532, 16113, 16183, 16325, 15426, 14935, 15713, 15746, 14563, 15847","repeated_count":"32","date":"12/18/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
