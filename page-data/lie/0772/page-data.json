If Trump were to push through a plan to sell health insurance across state lines, he would need to repeal all or part of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, a 1945 law that ensured that individual states remained the primary regulators of insurance. There is no evidence that allowing interstate sale of health insurance would reduce premiums by 60 to 70 percent.
