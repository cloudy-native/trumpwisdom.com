But there are other ways to slice the data, and it’s important to put this number into context. Most cases reviewed by the Supreme Court are reversed, and the 9th Circuit rules on more cases in general. The 9th Circuit’s reversal rate was usually higher than the average, but not always the highest. None of the data supports Trump’s contention that the court is “in chaos” and “in turmoil.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"0245","repeated_count":"1","date":"02/16/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
