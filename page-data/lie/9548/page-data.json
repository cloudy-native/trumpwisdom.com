It's a different situation than the mostly single men who tried to cross the border in large numbers in the early 2000s. Under Trump, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/stats/sw-border-migration#\">Customs and Border Protection agency has been releasing a combined total</a>, but the \"inadmissibles\" -- who numbered 9,653 in February -- are not part of the apprehensions. Inadmissibles include \"individuals encountered at ports of entry who are seeking lawful admission into the United States but are determined to be inadmissible, individuals presenting themselves to seek humanitarian protection under our laws, and individuals who withdraw an application for admission and return to their countries of origin within a short timeframe.\"","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/28/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
