And it's said cage. And somebody called me, and they said, 'Sir, that was built' -- One of the people that helped build it. 'That was built in 2014.' I said, '2014? I didn't happen to be President.' It was built under Obama/Sleepy Joe Biden.”","analysis":"A total perversion of what happened. When the Trump administration was separating migrant families at the southern border in 2018, part of the coverage focused on the caged enclosures where children and families were being detained. The New York Times did not claim that Trump built the cages, but Trump repeatedly sought to deflect criticism over his separation policy by noting that the Obama administration used cage enclosures to hold migrants before he did. The Obama administration never separated families systematically like Trump.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"10/23/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
