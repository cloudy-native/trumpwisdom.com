The report uses an economy-wide model to estimate what the effect of the agreement would be once the U.S. economy has adjusted to the full implementation of the law. Trump does not explain that full implementation is assumed to be six years after the rewritten trade agreement enters in force. “Estimates indicate that U.S. real GDP [gross domestic product] would grow by 0.35 percent ($68.2 billion) and employment would grow by 0.12 percent (about 176,000 jobs),” the report says. In context, that is not much of an impact, given the U.S. economy was adding about that many jobs every month before the pandemic struck.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"08/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
