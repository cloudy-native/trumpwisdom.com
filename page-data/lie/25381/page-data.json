She should be in jail for that. I don't even care if they're very highly confidential emails, I don't care what. She deleted. She got a question. She got a statement from Congress, a subpoena from Congress. Everybody, we want your emails, all of Hillary Clinton's emails, 33,000 of them. She deleted them. She acid washed them and she broke her telephones with a hammer. Okay. Broke them with a hammer.”","analysis":"Clinton’s staff had requested the emails to be deleted months before the subpoena, according to the FBI’s August 2016 report. Moreover, there’s no evidence Clinton deleted the emails in anticipation of the subpoena, and FBI director James B. Comey has said his agency’s investigation found no evidence that any work-related emails were “intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them.” ","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"29815, 29881, 28925, 27045, 26985, 25500, 25381, 25209, 25819, 25097, 24908, 24530, 24531, 24443, 24159, 23932, 18385, 18430, 17161, 14921, 15488, 14638, 14221, 13811, 13110, 13058, 13406, 12414, 11343, 11866, 11160, 11163, 11192, 11785, 11746, 11088, 10951, 10764, 10140, 9443, 8472, 6546, 6482, 5462, 5928, 5012, 4407, 4359, 3039, 2740, 2741, 0922, 0858, 0956","repeated_count":"54","date":"10/09/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
