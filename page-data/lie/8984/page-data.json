Fentanyl also comes in through the U.S.-Mexico border. China’s ban does not cover all of the precursor chemicals that are used to make fentanyl and its analogues. These chemicals are typically sent to Mexico from China and are used in composing the fentanyl that is used in the United States.","pinocchios":"","category":"Crime","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"02/25/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
