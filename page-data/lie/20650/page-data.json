And Europe was way early, and they're getting under control. We followed them, with this terrible China virus, and we are likewise getting under control. Some areas that were very hard-hit are now doing very well. Some were doing very well, and we thought they may be gone and they flare up, and we're putting out the fires. But other places were long before us, and they're now -- it's like life; it's got a life. And we're putting out that life, because that's a bad life that we're talking about.”","analysis":"China and Europe both appeared to have flattened the curve of coronavirus infections, but under pressure from Trump, some parts of the United States opened up too quickly, resulting in a new surge of infections. Now overall infections are surging in the United States -- which is not happening in China and Europe. The European Union will not even permit Americans to visit because of the outbreak in the USA.","pinocchios":"","category":"Coronavirus","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/02/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
