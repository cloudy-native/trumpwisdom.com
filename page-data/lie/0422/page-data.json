And I'm very strong on it and I'm going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month.”","analysis":"The United States spends about 3.6 percent of gross domestic product on defense spending , far more that NATO’s guideline of 2 percent. The median spending level for the 28 NATO countries is 1.53 percent of GDP, though NATO members are not expected to reach the 2 percent level until 2024. Meanwhile, the United States has defense responsibilities around the world, especially in Asia, which accounts for why U.S. spending is higher. In fact, U.S. bases in Europe are often used to redeploy forces in other theaters, such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa.
