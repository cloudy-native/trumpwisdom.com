Median income started to grow toward the end of his administration, a trend that Trump inherited. In 2019, median incomes did jump sharply. But the pandemic in 2020 should reduce incomes, so Trump will leave office with a mixed record that might even fall short of Obama's. (This is why scoring economic data by presidential term is not especially fruitful.)","pinocchios":"","category":"","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"09/16/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
