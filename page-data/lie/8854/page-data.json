You know what happened on the West Side Highway. That young wise guy drove over and killed eight people and horribly injured -- nobody talks about that -- horribly -- like, loss of legs and arms -- going 60 miles an hour, he made a right turn into a park on the West Side Highway, along the Hudson River in New York.”","analysis":"Trump says terror suspect Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov brought 22 relatives into the United States through \"chain migration\" or the diversity visa lottery. But no agency has confirmed this figure and experts say it is implausible because Saipov only had a green card, meaning he could only bring in his wife (already in the U.S.) or his minor children (already U.S. citizens). No one lost an arm, though one victim lost both legs.
