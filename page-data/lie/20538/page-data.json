And they send them out by the millions. I think I read over 30 million ballots are going to be sent out in California.”","analysis":"California is sending ballots to every registered voter -- 20 million people, according to the state. Absentee and mail-in ballots are essentially the same. Both require voters to register first. Trump indicates that he sometimes votes by mail out of necessity, but CNN reported that he voted by mail at times when he could have gone in-person. Most states do not require a reason for absentee voting, though some do require an excuse.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"06/25/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
