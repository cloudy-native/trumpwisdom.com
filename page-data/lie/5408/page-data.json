They didn't own it. And then it became a big scandal. But because it was a Democrat, the fake news didn't want to write about it. Then after spending like $50 million on some elevators, it turned out that they didn't work.”","analysis":"Richard Cordray, running for governor of Ohio, was the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB's building renovation actually cost $145 million, with the Office of Inspector General saying in 2015 that the construction costs “appeared reasonable.” Even in the Trump Tower, the elevators don't cost $50 million and we have no idea where he got this number. The most expensive elevator ever is the 1,070-foot-high Bailong Elevator, set in a Chinese mountain range. It cost $20 million.
