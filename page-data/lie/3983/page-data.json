You know, we signed an agreement. It said, we will begin the immediate denuclearization, OK, of North Korea. It says that we already got back the hostages and I saw it today, ‘Well, Obama got back hostages.’ Yeah. He paid $1.8 billion to get them back, OK.”","analysis":"President Barack Obama did not pay any money to get detainees back from North Korea or, depending on how you look at it, Iran. Trump’s reference to $1.8 billion refers to the timing of a settlement of a long-standing claim regarding undelivered aircraft made by Iran on the same day four American detainees, including The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian, were released. A jumbo jet carrying $400 million in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies landed in Tehran as the detainees flew off. That money purportedly was partial payment of an outstanding claim by Iran for U.S. military equipment that was never delivered. Soon after, $1.3 billion in cash followed. State Department officials have insisted that the negotiations over the claims and detainees were not connected but came together at the same time, with the cash payment used as “leverage” to ensure the release of detainees.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29452, 29687, 29967, 28670, 28214, 28806, 28998, 28084, 28175, 28341, 28002, 27686, 28238, 26842, 27150, 27328, 27517, 26383, 26471, 26220, 26125, 25703, 25576, 25329, 25393, 26578, 25919, 25124, 25058, 24936, 24755, 24862, 24737, 24641, 24390, 24327, 24198, 25018, 23908, 23798, 23855, 23668, 23486, 23273, 23067, 22006, 22382, 21677, 22478, 22987, 22992, 22126, 21500, 21424, 20534, 20100, 20044, 18093, 17761, 16527, 16640, 16166, 16350, 14160, 14446, 12543, 12705, 13122, 12547, 11620, 12202, 11405, 11416, 11973, 11312, 11907, 11447, 12260, 12250, 11296, 11211, 11742, 11124, 10827, 10684, 10272, 10120, 9901, 9723, 8583, 7944, 7688, 6837, 6124, 5434, 6324, 5382, 5325, 5532, 5833, 5775, 5777, 5719, 5728, 4880, 4975, 4430, 4246, 3734, 4127, 3580, 3983, 4031, 3520, 3923, 3347, 3071, 3079, 3108, 3095, 3016, 2983, 2924, 2908, 2315, 2089, 1872, 1382, 1471, 1394, 1015","repeated_count":"131","date":"06/23/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
