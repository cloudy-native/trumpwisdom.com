People talk about that. You know, if I put on a 10% or 20% tariff they make a big deal. They have 300% actually, 300%, 275%, 285%, these are the tariffs they charge.”","analysis":"Canada does have high dairy tariffs once a quota is reached, just as the United States props up sugar prices. But Canada's overall tariffs are lower than the United States -- and Canada made large dairy concessions in the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement negotiated by Barack Obama, which Trump pulled out of in the early days of his presidency. The United States has “a favorable quota,” according to the Brookings Institution, meaning it runs a trade surplus on dairy products and “no dairy products are sold to Canada outside the quota, so no U.S. exports really pay a high tariff.” According to the World Bank, here are the average tariff rates charged by G-7 nations:\nUS: 1.6%; EU: 1.6%; UK: 1.6%; Italy: 1.6%; Germany: 1.6%; France: 1.6%; Japan: 1.4%; Canada: 0.8%","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"28985, 26859, 27309, 25250, 24375, 22421, 22557, 22587, 20492, 20771, 18041, 17456, 17845, 16708, 16099, 16250, 12423, 12189, 11468, 10462, 10229, 9677, 8965, 6028, 6287, 5998, 5438, 5783, 5702, 5706, 5725, 5127, 5140, 5659, 5670, 4793, 4994, 4938, 4940, 4694, 4630, 4669, 4440, 4590, 4665, 3695, 3871, 4083, 3835, 4077, 3571, 3988, 4018, 3825, 3484, 3941, 3915, 3362, 3682, 3910, 3306, 3295","repeated_count":"62","date":"10/12/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
