He responded that he gets tested regularly for the novel coronavirus, and then added: \"Look, all you've got to do is watch me, and I can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I'm running against.\" The White House refused to release the results of an alleged cognitive test taken by Trump. In 2018, Trump passed a cognitive test known as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which tests for “mild cognitive dysfunction\" It's a 10-minute test and patients are asked to draw a clock, animals and other objects.
