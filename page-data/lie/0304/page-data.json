Trump claimed he saw on television thousands of Muslims cheer the collapse of the World Trade Center during the Sept. 11 attacks. There is no TV footage, no newspaper coverage, just scattered, unconfirmed reports of five or six people — not necessarily Muslim, probably teenagers — celebrating. There was a small reference buried deep in an article in The Post. When the reporter said it did not support Trump’s claim, Trump mocked his disability.","pinocchios":"4","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"03/22/2017","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
