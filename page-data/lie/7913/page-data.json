So we end up with court cases for people that just happened to step a foot on our land. You can't take care of them. You're talking tens of thousands.”","analysis":"Catch and release is a collection of policies, court precedents, executive actions and federal statutes spanning more than 20 years, cobbled together throughout Democratic and Republican administrations, including his own. It primarily applies to asylum seekers and children. People with serious crimes on their records, whether in the U.S. or another country, are not eligible for asylum. Trump is routinely astonished by the workings of U.S. and international laws on asylum. This is how it works in any country that abides by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees: A refugee enters and makes a petition, and the government makes a ruling after analyzing the facts. It's not the kind of thing you can wind down \"in an hour.\" It's also worth keeping in mind that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2018/06/26/president-trumps-misconceptions-about-immigration-courts-and-law/?utm_term=.61c2a2ffa3de\">85 percent</a> of all deportations in the United States are ordered quickly, without a hearing before a judge.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"14877, 14675, 13691, 11659, 11379, 11422, 12227, 11512, 11128, 10793, 10956, 10638, 10642, 10573, 10378, 10298, 9840, 9648, 9482, 9598, 9604, 9447, 9323, 9294, 8682, 8748, 8182, 7913, 7738, 7168, 6701, 6959, 7117, 7147, 6823, 7041, 7073, 6656, 6233, 6012, 5209, 6335, 6339, 6134, 6409, 6421, 6453, 5460, 5957, 5451, 5900, 4779, 4834, 5002, 4643, 4427, 4462, 4441, 3889, 3736, 3686, 3431, 3556, 3558, 3459, 3550, 3552, 3485, 3526, 3376, 3384, 3425, 3381, 3404, 3203, 3131, 3125, 2980, 2686, 2814","repeated_count":"80","date":"01/02/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
