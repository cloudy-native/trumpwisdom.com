Opioid prescriptions peaked in 2012 and started down in 2013, as states began restricting prescriptions and instituting computer checks to discourage “doctor shopping.”","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"28679, 27938, 21853, 18198, 13151, 12535, 12377, 12432","repeated_count":"8","date":"01/24/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
