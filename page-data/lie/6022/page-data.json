Sir, we're building the United States Embassy in Jerusalem. Oh, how much is it? $1.1 billion, sir. How the hell do you build 1.1 -- we're building a one-story building. Any builders in here from Wisconsin? You'd do it for about $200,000, right? Oh, it's true. I said, how do you spend $1.1 billion on a one-story structure? Sir, I don't know, but that's what they say it's going to cost. I say, wait a minute, I can't sign it. In fact, it's actually half-signed. No, it's signed half. It just says Donald. I didn't even get the J for John. Just says Donald and then you see it's a dead stop. I said, I'm not signing it. And I called up a great man, David Friedman, one of the most successful lawyers in New York. He's the ambassador to Israel. I said, David, they want us to buy this unbelievably expensive site and they want us to build a building that's going to cost $1.1 billion. Number one, it probably will take 25 years....we went out and we built the most beautiful building for $500,000.”","analysis":"The new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem is a temporary location. It's not a new building; the U.S. refurbished its existing consulate in Jerusalem. Costs for the permanent embassy could well surpass $400,000 when all is said and done.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"29432, 28675, 28464, 28176, 27484, 27195, 27331, 26394, 26222, 24648, 22102, 15930, 14394, 13955, 10273, 10045, 9724, 9592, 9488, 9457, 7791, 7290, 7292, 7468, 6866, 6921, 6781, 6586, 6261, 6252, 6022, 5369, 5329, 5735, 5120, 4916, 4973, 4247, 3666, 3276, 2480","repeated_count":"41","date":"10/24/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
