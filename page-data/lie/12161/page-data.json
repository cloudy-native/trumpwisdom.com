The scientific consensus is that climate change is the big driver of these intensifying wildfires. “The ones in Southern California are burning in chaparral, so it’s not a forest management issue at all,” LeRoy Westerling, a climate and fire researcher at the University of California at Merced, told us. “The fire in Northern California didn’t start in forest; it started in other types of vegetation, from what I read. … There, you're talking about what kind of vegetation people manage on their homes on private properties.”","pinocchios":"4","category":"Environment","repeated_ids":"26991, 27314, 25360, 25166, 26006, 24729, 24183, 24261, 24124, 24138, 24144, 24146, 24035, 23987, 20985, 17451, 14783, 14154, 14263, 12161, 11078, 10474, 8033, 7302, 7233, 7484, 6114, 4266, 4267","repeated_count":"29","date":"07/08/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
