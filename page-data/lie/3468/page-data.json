Soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. Farmers have done poorly for 15 years.

However, the price of soybeans has not dropped “50 percent since 5 years before the election,” according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. In 2011, five years before the 2016 election, soybeans peaked at $13.40 per bushel. In May 2018, soybeans cost $9.84 per bushel. That’s a 27 percent drop. Measuring since 2011, the lowest price was $8.56 in March 2016. Tariffs and trade barriers are not pushing these prices down; record soybean plantings and record yields are the cause.","pinocchios":"","category":"Trade","repeated_ids":"17457, 18292, 11523, 12064, 11923, 5825, 5245, 5738, 5656, 5640, 4979, 4997, 4437, 4373, 4664, 4520, 4230, 3468, 4082, 4042, 3907","repeated_count":"21","date":"07/11/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
