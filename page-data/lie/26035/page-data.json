But <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FUcxqGObZc&feature=youtu.be&t=356\">a video of the 2016 event</a> shows Biden was clearly joking early in his speech, given during a stop in Abu Dhabi in March 2016. “I have incredibly good judgment. One, I married Jill. And two, I appointed [Lt. Karen] Johnson to [attend] the [U.S. Air Force] Academy. I just want you to know that,” he said. “Clap for that, you stupid bastards.” The audience smiled and began to clap and Biden added, “Man, you are a dull bunch.” Biden ended his speech by thanking the military personnel for their service. “You are the finest generation of warriors the world has ever, ever known,” he declared.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"25189, 26035","repeated_count":"2","date":"09/29/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
