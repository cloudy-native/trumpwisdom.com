Bill Clinton negotiated a nuclear agreement with North Korea that froze its plutonium program and was working on a missile deal when he departed office. But that agreement fell apart under George W. Bush. But then Bush tried to negotiate a deal, even lifting sanctions on North Korea. But that deal fell apart once Obama was elected. In each case, North Korea used the arrival of a new president to wiggle out of its commitments. Other presidents also obtained the release of detainees held by North Korea.","pinocchios":"","category":"Foreign policy","repeated_ids":"9159, 9004, 8710, 8352, 8294, 6297, 5328, 5531, 5720, 5157, 4592, 4367, 4302, 4033, 3971, 3924, 16809, 3367, 3305, 3298, 3301, 2949, 2905, 2805, 2632, 2802, 2550, 2489, 2491, 2301, 2075, 2111, 1984, 1955, 1893, 1333, 1317, 1317, 1286, 1286, 1268, 0996, 0580, 0495","repeated_count":"44","date":"09/24/2018","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
