Never fight uphill, me boys, right? That was Robert E. Lee said, 'Never fight uphill.' He heard they were fighting uphill, but they didn't have cell phones in those days. They tried to get him to stop, but they fought uphill.”","analysis":"Trump attributes this \"never fight uphill\" quote to Robert E. Lee, a traitor who commanded troops of the Confederate States of America during the U.S. Civil War. Whether Lee actually said this (in the 1800s) is unclear. But this military tactic is credited to the The Art of War, an ancient Chinese military treatise attributed to Sun Tzu, written between 475 and 221 BCE. \"It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://suntzusaid.com/book/7/33/\">says the treatise</a>. It is odd, but not surprising, that Trump would instead celebrate a leader of the Confederacy when making this point.
