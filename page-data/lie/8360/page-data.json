Any illegal vote deprives Americans of their voice.”","analysis":"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/laws/advisory2019-02.shtml\">In an advisory</a>, the Texas secretary of state’s office flagged 95,000 individuals who were not citizens when they obtained a drivers license or ID card to county election administrators. 58,000 of those people previously voted, but it’s unclear whether or not they had obtained citizenship by the time they cast a vote. After all, people are naturalized all the time.  Plus, the office cautioned that “all records submitted through this process will need to be treated as WEAK matches,” not firm evidence as Trump suggests. \n\nThere is no evidence that undocumented immigrants are voting in California in vast numbers. Voter fraud is extremely rare, though obviously errors can be made. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles acknowledged in October that 1,500 people may have been incorrectly registered because of a processing error — including at least one noncitizen (a legal resident, not an undocumented immigrant). The incorrect registrations were canceled before the election.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"8357","repeated_count":"1","date":"01/27/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
