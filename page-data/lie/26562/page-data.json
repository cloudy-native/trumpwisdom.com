I ended a regulation that nobody would have done. This brings public housing, low-income housing into the suburbs. And by the way, just so we can get this straight, 30% of the people in the suburbs are low-income people, 30% of the people in the suburbs are minorities. And so, we're ruining this American dream for everybody, but he's got a plan. It's the worst thing you've ever seen having to do with zoning.”","analysis":"Trump rescinded federal affordable housing rules, but many states have affordable housing laws of their own that call for an equitable distribution of zoning for low-income housing in otherwise high-income areas.

Such zoning measures do not affect quality of life in the suburbs, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fairsharedevelopment.org/climbing-mount-laurel\">decades of research on affordable housing laws and their impact</a>. Such policies tend to benefit minorities and improve social mobility.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"28242, 27439, 26562, 23347, 23337, 23330, 22907, 22942, 22979","repeated_count":"9","date":"09/30/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
