But it never did. And worse, it tested the very weapons it said it was going to give up.”","analysis":"The agreement reached in the Six-Party talks was more ambiguous than Trump indicates, as it suggested that the parties would provide North Korea with light-water nuclear reactors. (That was certainly Pyongyang's interpretation.) Indeed, the statement said the regime would \"abandon\" its weapons rather than the American-preferred phrase of \"dismantle.\" In any case, the agreement quickly fell part largely because the U.S. Treasury targeted a bank in Macao that handled cash for the North Korean leadership. The North Korean test convinced the George W. Bush administration to get serious about negotiations -- and to abandon the Treasury action.
