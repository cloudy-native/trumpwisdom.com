The DOJ inspector general did not find evidence that political bias influenced the FBI’s decision in the fall of 2016 to seek a wiretap on a former Trump campaign aide, Carter Page. However, the inspector general identified 17 inaccuracies and omissions in the initial application and three renewal requests, a stunning number for a sensitive case that FBI officials knew would be subject to close scrutiny.","pinocchios":"","category":"Russia","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/09/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
