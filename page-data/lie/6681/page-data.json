She never met -- it was a made-up story. She made up the story....She lied about the story, about rape -- about rape. She lied. And we're supposed to sit back and take it.”","analysis":"Christine Blasey Ford said she decided to come forward with an allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in 1982 only after a confidential letter she sent to her congresswoman leaked this year. “I am no one’s pawn,” Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 27. Trump at first called Ford’s testimony credible. But once the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the president called the whole thing a “all fiction, made up stuff.\" Regardless, she has not recanted her testimony.
