That's a difference of 11 times more. It's hundreds of thousands of votes.”","analysis":"Trump has been flogging this claim since November. But state officials have explained he’s comparing incorrect data.\n\n“One of the numbers you're seeing out there is that a 3 percent rejection rate versus this 0.5 percent rejection rate, but they're comparing it to apples to oranges,” Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/georgia-press-conference-on-election-count-updates-transcript-november-17\">said at Nov. 17 news conference</a>. “That is including [all rejected] ballots. The biggest chunk of ballots are rejected or counted as rejected showed up after the 7 p.m. deadline. That is where the majority of rejections come from. But for signature matches always run around 0.15 to 0.2 percent. That is the normal thing we've seen in Georgia for years.” A new law also gave Georgians a chance to correct problems, such as a rejected signature, with their ballots. Sterling noted the Democrats appeared more prepared for the task of helping voters who faced problems.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"12/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
