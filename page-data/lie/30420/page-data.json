But state election officials use multiple safeguards to verify that mail ballots are authentic. Most states have bar codes printed on their mail ballots. When a completed ballot arrives, election officials scan the barcode to link it with the corresponding voter in the system. Duplicate ballots from the same voter wouldn’t be counted by the system.\n\nIn addition, voters must follow specific instructions to return a ballot received in the mail, such as signing an affidavit. Officials typically compare the signature on the ballot with the one in the registration and may discard ballots with mismatched signatures.","pinocchios":"","category":"Election","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"11/05/2020","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
