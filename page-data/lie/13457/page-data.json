As for the doubling in health insurance premiums, that claim is based on a White House report that made some questionable methodological choices.","pinocchios":"","category":"Health care","repeated_ids":"20219, 18018, 17822, 17787, 17043, 18416, 17534, 16898, 18312, 16899, 15718, 15109, 13457","repeated_count":"13","date":"10/03/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
