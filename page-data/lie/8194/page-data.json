But other than that, we don't want to have openings. And you'll see the crime rate in this country go way down. And we're already doing very well in terms of crime rate but it's not being helped by what's going on. We could make it a lot better. So I appreciate it very much.”","analysis":"Trump's statement that a border wall would bring the crime rate \"way down\" makes little sense. There is no evidence to suggest that is the case. Most undocumented immigrants do not cross the southern border and undocumented immigrants do not commit crimes at a rate higher than U.S. citizens.","pinocchios":"","category":"Immigration","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"01/10/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
