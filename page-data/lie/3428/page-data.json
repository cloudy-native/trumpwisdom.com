A Rigged Witch Hunt!”","analysis":"President Trump is taking the FBI Inspector General's remarks out of context. The report criticizes Comey's decision making process when he chose to announce the end of and reopening of the Clinton investigation, but the report found these moves were not politically motivated. There's no evidence that the special counsel investigation is a witch hunt or a hoax. In fact, the special counsel has revealed significant criminal activity by some of Trump's campaign advisers and by Russian individuals and entities. The investigation into potential collusion between Russia and Trump's campaign continues, and no conclusions have been announced. There also no evidence that the Democrats colluded with Russia. Rather, there's more evidence they were victimized.
