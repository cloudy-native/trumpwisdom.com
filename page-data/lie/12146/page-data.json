They said ‘Advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen.’ Now really, does that sound like me? What advisors, there were no talking points … except for those stated by me, & ‘reams of paper’ were never given to me. It is a made up story meant to demean & belittle. The Post had no sources.”","analysis":"This is a strange complaint, since <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/he-always-doubles-down-inside-the-political-crisis-caused-by-trumps-racist-tweets/2019/07/20/b342184c-aa2e-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html\">the article Trump is referring to</a> said, \"As is often the case, Trump acted alone — impulsively following his gut to the dark side of American politics.\" In any case, it's common for his staff to prepare research and talking points before he makes public remarks or attacks opponents. The Washington Post interviewed 26 White House aides for the article. None of them were named, but that was at their request. Administration officials frequently make anonymity a condition of speaking to journalists.","pinocchios":"","category":"Miscellaneous","repeated_ids":"","repeated_count":"0","date":"07/22/2019","portfolio":"lie"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
